16361,How come they didnt add milk into it without actual milk wouldnt it just juice
16362,I love all the changes! The visual for the theme song makes the show seem more serious compared to the brightly-coloured previous one. And I absolutely love the end screen! :)
16363,"She's already gushing. Ooh, that's brown! -Link Neal, 2019"

16598,Soooo we getting milk'n at easy tshirts right
16599,they just drank spiders on day one
16600,Not gonna lie - I dont really like the new intro. The transitions are cheap and its really boring to watch. Its not fluid or dynamic at all. Music is really boring as well.
16601,Did rhett say... Year of the twink?
16602,"WHY DO YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE THEME! I FINALLY GOT USED TO IT! But glad yall are back, I can't survive without you! Love you Rhett and Link!"
16603,Mmmmm I dont really like the new intro its too tame
16604,"So happy you guys are back!! All the best for the new year!
This was a great start!!
Amazing new intro guys!!"
16605,Welcome back guys! Love the intro btw
16606,"Gotta say, I'm a fan of the new intro"
16607,"season 15 looks like its gonna be great, I love the intro, its so jazzy"

16614,Nourished! I think the word youre looking for is nourished lol
16615,Okay the new theme blending in with the intro 'let's talk about that' is bloody awesome.

16632,Welcome Season 15
16633,Wtf
16634,What about pizza milk?
16635,how many times did you guys say Giggity during this episode?
16636,"I thought there'd be actual milk involved, that's disappointing. Nut juices aren't milk, so this is more like 'Will it water?' or 'will it cheesecloth?' since nothing about milk is even involved here."
16637,Why am I still up?
16638,your intro got me trippin
16639,Ugh I love that you come back right in time for me to procrastinate for exam season
16640,Is Rhett using a Bobby pin?!

16650,Oh Rhett squeezing a nut sack is super easy but not always encouraged
16651,"2019, year of the twink. -Rhett McLaughlin"
16652,Love you
16653,Got milk?
16654,"Alright love the new logo, love the new intro"

16670,milk hard is all I'm gonna in 2019 XD
16671,"Holy Crump, the intro is getting more hipster each season. Next one gonna have sitars up in here."
16672,But skittle milk? Please tell me you didnt forget skittle milk...
16673,Its three in the morning excuse me what.
16674,good call on not doing the roach thing cz I would never watch again if you go this far!!
16675,finally you is back !
16676,Love that the old intro style is back. Nice one!
16677,Cow TEET!  So Much for Link keeping down 2019!  Better to fail now than November...
16678,"Ya know, sometimes it is a little too much to mentally grasp. Spider milk is one of those times where there is no way I can watch someone dink and sink.
I appreciate you guys. Keep doing you."
16679,"Hey, we never saw Rhetts celestial fourth arm on his back thats made of pent up emotions in season 14."
16680,Sqeazeing a nut-sack is not easy

16691,This might just be me but I love chewing chicken
16692,Congrats on 15th years of good mythical morning
16693,its so weird to me that they didnt (agreeably) say no until the last round
16694,"Hmmmmmm. The video was great, but the intro just didn't have that GMM feeling for me. Not saying its a bad intro, but it just lacks that idk Cozy? feeling that other intros had (don't know how to describe it). The one with the chicken (I forgot the name) flying through like a forest and then sitting on a cliff was great, but my favourite is with the camera going around a tall rock, and there are eggs rolling down it and the chicken is on the top (Since I started watching GMM when that was the intro). Nonetheless, Love your videos Rhett and Link. Hope you had and will have an amazing year. Thank you for making these videos for us! <3"
16695,The new intro is cool
16696,Twinkish
16697,Just woke up so good morning peeps

17812,Fox News Saying The PS2 Game Bully Causes Bullying
17813,I think that it's interesting that these controversies yet Insurance companies are STILL NOT regulated. AND NO ONE (media) has ever brought this fact to light.  Why is this ? Maybe because the ins. co's. own the media ?  They certainly can afford to.
17814,"Number 1,mangles gender"
17815,"People are playing video games all over the world yet almost all the shootings happen in USA.
I wonder why..."
17816,"I guess the question is why do people enjoy playing games that are completely and only glorify senseless torture and gore? Its the people who find pleasure in these things that exclusively glorify and fetish deliberate killing and torture that disturb me. Banning and censoring isnt the answer but the amount of popularity to senseless violence disturbs me. Thats not saying that violence should never be shown, but rather should at least by portrayed in a meaningful manner. Not sadistic pleasure for the sick person playing."
17817,It's just a game it's not real
17818,I realize alot of Americans are delusional... Games make them go on Mass Shooting... How about taking a look at the state and environment of your country first....
17819,GTA influencing criminals is like saying I can now drive a car because I played Gran Turismo.
17820,"The ""No Russian"" controversy is so stupid. The mission plays an important part in the story, and we're not even required to shoot the civilians."
17821,"Notice how gta was never mentioned in this video once, its because rockstar has so many fans that fox cant touch them without getting flamed by millions of people, they only go after small games that arent known or not even out yet. But thats just my opinion. Agree or disagree, idc."
17822,Conservatives constantly throw bitch fits about comedians and video games yet refer to liberals as snowflakes
17823,Some times I fucking hate people!!!
17824,"Grand theft controversy.good one mojo,good one."
17825,Fox news
17826,"Well, I just looked at the history of school shootings on the internet, and found that beyond the mid 80's to today, there was a major increase.  Maybe due to what they put in movies, but it does correspond to the era when video games became popular. I don't think that we can leave out video games as sort of an influencer.  I mean, the bottom line is that all video games are a fantasy that you can play out."
17827,"War games should not be made.  War is NOT fun, or funny, and there's NOTHING positive about it.  THEY SHOULD NOT BE MAKING GAMES!!"
17828,Jinx does have blackface.... sadly
17829,"The Australian rating thingie is funded by the government? So THAT'S where all of my taxes go!
* Accidentally starts Top Ten Comments That Will 100% Start A Debate Online *"
17830,"The Night Trap controversy is just stupid.
So whenever a character in a video game (who happens to be a female) gets attacked, its then automatically called sexist, a male character gets attacked no one cares."
17831,two will debate worry painful they clinical following.
17832,Did anyone else hear the hi during the lady talking @ 1:11
17833,Charlet Chung as Aisha agents of mayhem
17834,Star Wars Battlefront 2 everything
17835,Postal 2?
17836,I played the fuck out of state of emergency and grand theft auto.Never ever thought about going on a rampage.
17837,The sad thing is that they are blaming video games YET AGAIN for the mass shootings at schools. It is obvious that video games have become the scapegoat for politicians to not set the NRAs asses on fire to actually look into gun biolence
17838,"Some people are just too sensitive, stupid, and closed minded. Ill never get to play manhunt 2 in all of its glory. I hate this world. And I despise the people out there giving video games a bad name. And why cant school shooters just skip the school shooting part and just jump to the part where they kill themselves? That would be great."
17839,"Mortal Kombat maybe should have been #1. At the time it was one of the biggest controversies in the country, everyone was talking about it. No one had ever seen anything like that before"
17840,We used to burn people at a stake maybe people are just pieces of shit so maybe it's not the video games
17841,"So if the Battle of Fallujah was cancelled because it showed innocent civilians dying, then what about the fucking Terminator or Saving Private Ryan? By the way, didn't the video specifically mention that war veterans were helping with the games development? I mean if they don't mind their partners, possibly best friends, being portrated, why should we?"
17842,Wasn't COD World at War inspired by the World War(my guess)? I wonder what video game THOSE people played back in the 1920s to become so obsessed about trying to murder another country.
17843,There was a murder near where I lived and a girl was stabbed over 100 times. Rapped in carpet and set on fire in the back alley and the lad who done it was addicted to violent video games and was smoking weed and playing GTA5 about 30 minutes before he done it but that's just an excuse when he would of possibly done it anyway but you never know if that's true in cases and violent movies and games definitely influence the mind
17844,Christians+Feminists+Fox news= Gamers worst nightmare

17847,If it wasn't video games it would be horror movies or rock & roll or god forbid crocheting. Every mass murderer needs a hobby and as long as it's not a hobby with a lot of lawyers that could an would sue them for associating their product with the brutal deaths of innocent people go right on ahead and slander it.
17848,"For the 6 Days in Fallujah lady: not once have I ever played a game and joked or laughed about getting killed. Not ince. It's always ""No!"" or ""Bullshit!"" or ""Dammit!"". Never ""Oh, I died. Hahaha"".
Release Six Days In Fallujah."
17849,There are no games that pissed me off..i luv the airport massacre scene it was awesome
17850,Thank the heavens there are conclusive evidence that games are bad for u.
17851,Those people who think pokemon is satanic are just doushbags on crack
17852,Posting skyrim makes me put on my armor and swing a greatsword in large cwords.
17853,Kid shot and killed 18 people? Cuphead did it
17854,"I dont see why they had to censor Manhunt 2. The original game went uncensored. Maybe instead of uselessly complaining about the content, just consider that maybe, just MAYBE, not all video games are for children?"
17855,"Yes obviously video games cause shootings, rather than stupidly lax gun laws."
17856,"So being forced to read ""Lord of the Flies"" and "" Or Men and Mice"" has no impact on me, but playing Mincraft does?"
17857,And postal 2?
17858,"The fact that the american society is sick, isn't games' fault. No matter if mediocre politicians invent a causal relation with mass shootings to gain attention, at the end, only in America there's mass shootings everyday, and that's not because of videogames"
17859,"The only games that piss me off are the ones that don't get released cause people think they are bad.. Get over yourselves, people don't go killing people cause they played a game, they know right from wrong.. They use a game to try get off Scott free, that's what they do, wait or a game that seems good to suit their plans and then use that to hopefully get away with it. Also parents are responsible for what their kids play, if a game is 18 then your kids should not play it, parents should be held responsible because they are the ones who obviously buy the game for their kids also, knowing it is 18 rated."
17860,"0:22 ""These games need some kind of a warning"" yeah like saying M rated 17 and up?"
17861,No russian gonna be on here lol
17862,"Oh I remember how ""Mortal Kombat"" was. Graphic & controversial for its time."
17863,No Russian was lit
17864,Insane.
17865,"Ahh the 90's. When Pokemon, Harry Potter, and foosball were the Devil."
17866,People are stupid
17867,"america should be renamed ""amerifags."" because they bitch and moan about ""video game violence.""
I guess violence in movies, to them don't exist.
I also guess WWII didn't exist because it was the most violent war imaginable. what about The Vietnam War? or the Son of Sam killings? I guess to the fucking retarded media, video games were around back in the 40's - 70's.
fucking amerifaggots."
17868,Videogames shouldn't be cancelled because there are people who are mature and smart enough to understand that you dont have to do what the Videogames said but of course there are always excepcions but i think that The parents that know that their kids can't play the games shouldn't bought them i am 18 years old and i played a lot of gta mortal kombat and my brother who is six years younger than me and my best friend have also played these games and fps but they are not violent persons i am not american but i think that They should know if a person can or can't play a videogame
17869,"Numbers 4, 3 and 2 are sick and reprehensible. Gotta be honest."
17870,OMFG VIDEO GAMES CONNECTION TO SHOOTINGS THIS IS BULLSHIT
17871,"whispers ""thrill kill thrill kill thrill kill thrill kill thrill kill thrill kill thrill kill thrill kill thrill kill thrill kill thrill kill thrill kill thrill kill thrill kill thrill kill thrill kill."""
17872,"I laughed out loud at the guy calling Pokemon ""demonic"" and saying it was about ""witchcraft."" Cute little creatures with powers are evil? There are plenty of animals in real life with ""superpowers."" There is a bird that is toxic to the touch, caterpillars with poison barbs, etc. Is nature ""demonic"" too? I thought God created all the animals. I'm not an atheist, but religious zealots are just...""misinformed"" would be the kind word I would use..."
17873,"The only time I've ever seen a video game make someone violent is in my cousin, his dad doesn't discipline him at all and let's him do, and play whatever he wants, so because of this my just turned 8 year old cousin started playing GTA V when he was 6 years old, and now someone says something about him, he punches them multiple times"
17874,"feel like it be worse if there was no video games like how would someone vent their violence or aggression humans have always been violent sure theres gyms but sooner or later you're going to snap takes one bad day for shit to hit the fan 
think on how many wars we have or had how many shootings by some nutjob games like gta is always a target  
say video games is more of a outlet an it allows you to explore your violent side but here's the thing i know its bad or wrong to to kill people just because its in a game doesn't mean i want to do it to real people but heres another thing it happens in movies tv or your everyday life like school some kid is being a jack ass to someone for no apparent reason other then to be an asshole but if you fight back you are the one who gets kicked out or some bar some stuff happens in there too people have always been violent they rather just blame it on something else other than human nature an if you're so fucking worried stop buying your 7 year olds games like that give em super mario pac man or some shit stop blaming everything for your own faults"
17875,"I'm tired if liberals and conservatives bitching about stuff they don't like it don't understand. The next time conservatives say that us millennials are sensitive, I'm going to say that ""You're a bunch of hypocrites."" Stupid old people."
17876,It pisses me off when people say that violent games lead to violent actions. A violent game is no worse than a violent movie. But you don't see people blaming movies for it now do ya???
17877,Whats the soundtrack called when six days in Faluger came on?
17878,"3:11 Well fuck you government, thats why I use steam on pc."
17879,VIDEO GAMES WILL RULE THE WORLD
17880,Fucking white people on the news make me sick when they start complaining about violent video games
17881,No Guns no mass murders
17882,"Each time I heard that games caused some mass killing, my heart brokes. Not because I'm fan of video games. It's because no one is looking into real problem, putting the blame on someone else. And since no one is listening to what video games had on their defense the problem is rising. I'm only waiting to see when video games will be banned at all and everyone suddenly realize it's too late to solve real issue."
17883,"I'm so glad I did not grow up with psychotic parents that didn't let me play the video games I wanted. I have been playing violent video games since I was 5 years when my dad brought home the original Doom for my pc, the. For my birthday I got a super Nintendo with Mortal Kombat 1. I used to go to my friends houses and their parents seemed like they were half crazy the way they would obsess over what game their kids were playing, it's crazy to me, their just games, I even got fired from GameStop back when GTA 4 came out because I didn't ""warn parents"" about the game or check kids IDs, I'm sorry but I refuse to treat video game with the same amount of danger as cigarettes."
17884,"Wow, that lady on Fox News taking about the mass effect sex scene just straight up lied, ""it's a man in this game deciding how many women he wants to be with"", I meancjesus what a conniving lying cunt, 1. You can only sleep with 1 girl and like the narrator said it's boring as all hell and 2. YOU CAN PLAY AS A FUCKING WOMAN!."
17885,"There is a lot of ""swill"" in this video."
17886,Why would you sensor the titties? T.T
17887,"I consider myself an example of why video games don't cause certain behaviors and violence like some people say they do.
I blew cats up, using them as shotgun mufflers in Postal 2, and I have a bunch of cats around my house. 
Some of them occasionally go missing, so could easily torture/kill them and blame it on predators, BUT I DON'T. Hell, I'm practically a vegetarian, and if I got a pet, I would very likely adopt one.
So you can see how much violence in video games has affected my real life behavior-  NOT ONE BIT. I also played Manhunt 2 on my PSP and I actually felt CALMER after playing than before."
17888,I always have that feeling I want to conquer the world and slave everybody after playing Civilization. Could it be somehow connected?
17889,"video game violence is fun, but i never thought about holding a gun and shooting my neighborhood."
17890,"Hmm. For some reason, I suddenly feel like playing some Pokemon. How strange."
17891,there is billion kids who doesnt get harm or effected but they always talk about that 1 kid who had mental problems got effected by video games and does bad stuff THATS NOT GAMESFAULT THATS PARENTS FAULT THEY SHOULD LOOK WHAT THE KID DOES BUT THEY DONT DO THAT OR MAYBE SAY IT DOESNT EFFECT KIDS LET HIM PLAY AND WHEN THE KID GOES NUTS THEY BLAME THE GAME AND SAY EVER KID CAN BE LIKE THIS NO YOUR KID COULD BE LIKE THIS AND IT DID YOU IDIOT!!!!!!
17892,"The one about DOOM pisses me off because that has to be one of the most respectable FPS franchises in the history of gaming. Those are just butt hurt people who want to give video game companies an excuse to be ""respectful"""
17893,How about the LEFT 4 DEAD?
17894,I try to kill more people than makarov before the mission ends
17895,"Final verdict: 
Fox News reporters are dumbasses"
17896,anything remotely bad happens new FUCKING VIDEO GAMES
17897,"Portal 2 made fun of being adopted and that is ""controversal"" Grow some balls and laugh at gabens jokes."
17898,Because my Xbox controller can teach me how to operate a mass shooting with 50 cal rifles... me... a med school student who cried when shooting a real gun at age 12 at a fucking can
17899,Modern warfare 2 thing what the heck it's a video game
17900,11- the entire south park stick of the truth game
17901,Of course Fox News and over protective parents bitching about violent video games
17902,People that are fucked in the head are fucked in the head a video game is not going to make them that way

Same stupid argument can be made."
17907,"WatchMojo, you might as well make another top 10 for incidents revolving around GG (Gamergate) and tons of events that lead to that mess of a topic. GG left a very sour taste in my mouth for what the gaming community was turning into, and how even ""left-wing"" media was getting into the discussion."
17908,"Adults don't understand video games. It's just ridiculous, video games are a form of entertainment. They take it so literally."
17909,"That bitch don't know a thing about gamers, we do not laugh when we die"
17910,Australia worst country ever

17913,5:24. wtf?
17914,pokemon is teaching you friendship not animal abuse peta
17915,people talking about cool games and want to ban em are shits
17916,I'm surprised they didn't include the controversy from Shadow the Hedgehog.
17917,No Russian easily my favorite mission. Has my highest k/d and it's so much blood. Ahh so many fun memories.
17918,THIS IS MADNESS STOP THE WAR. STOP WAR ON TERROR NOW!!!! AND STOP THE TERRORIST ATTACKS NOW!!!.
17919,"US logic: 
Let's ban fictional games and instead give our children real guns to kill their siblings.. eh, I mean to ""protect themselves""."
17920,I'm going to say that video games are what keep me from going psycho. Whenever I get angry (and I mean REALLY angry) I play gta or shadow of mordor. I'd be willing to bet that games prevented tons of shootings just by keeping a psychos anger in check.
17921,"WatchMojo: "" the CONSERVATIVE media said this, the CONSERVATIVE media said that."" Obviously you guy are libs but don't pretend Conservatives are the ones who always get triggered and butt hurt about things."
17922,The people that think video games cause shootings are fucking dumbasses because of as they said there are tons of studies that have been done to show that video games actually do a lot of good stuff for us
17923,"I hate people that think that guns kill people.  Guns don't kill people, the asshole behind the gun us who kills people."
17924,this dumbass Americans always blame gamers for everything that happens in real life but they don't want to accept that how easy it is to get a real gun for yourself in United States.
17925,This stuff happens in real life. Dont like it? Kill yourself.
17926,FUCK JACK THOMPSON
17927,"so... when a game involves other country in disaster is okay for Americans, but when non American kill an American in video game is considered as foul or so? well then fuck you filthy Americans"
17928,"A few kids that played DooM and (by complete coincidence) had easy access to real weapons AND they were experienced with using them from a young age, killed several innocents in a school shootout? Yep, that's right.. it must be done.. ban DooM."
17929,Pokemon is bloody.
17930,lol of all the games never expected Pokemon to be controversial lol

17934,"There are anti war activists in America? That's like finding anti corruption activists in the Kremlin.
And holy fuck I just realised this video is over 4 years old!"
17935,"If I'm being completely honest, Grand Theft Auto is quite overrated."
17936,"If you're not, at the very least, an avid gamer your opinion on video games doesn't mean shit. Because you don't know shit about them."
17937,"I really hat the Fallujah game controversy, it's just so stupid"
17938,"I'm 23 and even I was a bit shocked by the torture scene in GTA 5.
All I thought was, there are some shit parents out there letting their kid play this, completely unaware of what the content is like.
Also I was totally unfazed by the massacre in MW2, but now that I think about it, that had some well deserved blow back."
17939,"And why PEOPLE blame video games? Not movies?
Are they retarded?
Like Fox News saying
""IT'S VERY REALISTIC""
REALISTIC MY @$$.
HOW A VIDEO GAME CAN BE REALISTIC. MOVIES ARE REALISTIC OF COURSE.
Everyone plays video games,but sometimes someone want to do it but can't so they play vidro games instead.
Like:
A peraon wants brutally kill everyone by Executions with shears in their eyes.
You can't do it in real life,excelt Manhunt 2.
A random guy wants to bang with  everyone,even a alien,he plays a good old Mass Effect.
A assassin wants to kill people for revenge. He plays Dishonored.
A random guy wants to punch everyond with a $#@&# and slread Dubstep,he plays Saints Row.
A kid wants to kill everyone,he plays GTA.
A badass marine wants to kill demons,he plays Doom.
Videogames. We like them. We hate them. We love them. Can save a life of everyone.
Bonus: A goat wants to go ham on the city. He plays Fla- I mean Goat Simulator.
And a psychopath wants to kill people for vengeance,he plays Postal or
             HATRED."
17940,Notice how almost all of the bullshit stories and the stupid and idiotic debates such as the onr about MW2 are all on FOX
17941,The hot coffee one was just a cheap way to generate viewers the hot coffee thing was dummies out that is where the thing is made inaccessible but left on the disk since removing large bits of code could glitch out the game
17942,Fuck jack thompson
17943,"it's simple. it really is. If a game is rated M: DON'T BUY THEM FOR YOUR CHILDREN! That's on you for not looking into what your child wants to play. Any decision a person of ANY age makes that's ""caused"" by a video game, is complete bullshit. I get so sick hearing parents say ""Oh my God! What is this that my child is playing?!?! it's so violent! There's so much language! Some of these people are nude!"" 9/10, these same parents just didn't pay attention and bought it because their lid wanted it. You can't hold that against all video games. But you can hold it against all parents."
17944,Why didn't Doom take #1? They were the original game blamed for Columbine and actually went head to head with the Government and prevented them from controlling what games we can and can not have.
17945,"I like the mission""no russian"""
17946,I've played Super Mario my entire life and not once have I felt the urge to jump on a turtle.
17947,Notice how Fox News keeps coming up?
17948,"TBH, Manhunt 2 wasn't like Manhunt, where you're killing people just to please a snuff film director. In that game, you're basically a scientist who's killing to recover his memories, which has him being involved with a government-sponsored weapons program involving mind control and brainwashing to create the perfect assassin."
17949,I hate all of the controversies
17950,What about bullly
17951,"That last woman sums it all:
""You cannot just blame it on one video game or two video games. [...] Mental illness is a big problem."""
17952,Still not as bad as 'Dog Slayer 2'. It's shocking that no one is talking about this.
17953,"every single people who covered those games were completely retarded. at least some people that i saw somewhere else that i didn't agree with, at least had some points. not in this video though, they're just stupid."
17954,"People get to triggered about video games. Seriously,freaking pokemon!"
17955,For number 6: Australian Government hates Adult freedom and adult content. They considered a threat of morality by MPs. It's a sorry state for Australia.
17956,People always arguing over rated M games and they never say shit about rated R movies
17957,Take note of the fact that most of these news clips are from FOX...
17958,"you can reset your game my son can.
well no shit. Your son was in the military and went to war and this is a FUCKING VIDEO GAME YOU RETARD"
17959,"Game Control is no different than Gun Control; Exploitative attempts to blame inanimate items so as to shoehorn bad policy into law, in order to enrich their own power bases. Everytown, Bloomberg an Giffords are every bit as odious as Thompson or Clinton."
17960,Where's Spec Ops the Line?
17961,"I remember playing the No Russian mission when I was 10 or 11. I normally am not too bothered by video game violence, but I remember quitting that mission immediately and almost vomited. Given the increasing number and brutality of recent terrorist attacks, it made watching that scene again even harder."
17962,"Why public always blame videogames? Noy movies?
Look,i was playing many gory and violent games since i was 8. (Even tho i played Far Cry 3 since i was 6) Like,Call of Duty,GTA,Mortal Kombat,Fallout and many others."
17963,I know a controversity....SPINOSAURUS vs t rex
17964,Man the government in austrailia is a pussy when it comes to video games
17965,"I honestly felt bad when torturing the guy in GTA5, I like to shoot people and hit them with the car, but torture is too sadistic, as farfetched as it sounds"
17966,The GTA sex scenes made me nearly wet myself with laughter XD
17967,Fucking Fox News
17968,"Only one I could agree on is No Russian, that is just a little bit fucked up"
17969,"7:58
is this why Seth MacFarlane thinks all conservatives are assholes?"
17970,Conservatives are very happy to make the accusation that video games are to blame for gun violence but conveniently side-step the issue of gun ownership. Hmm
17971,You must not tell wise
17972,"I think there was also a controversy about Resident Evil 5, didn't an organization tried to prevent the game from being released because black people are killed in the game?"
17973,"politics only care when they can't get votes can't bribe you out of your money, or the people making moneyor characters are minorities."
17974,is something wrong with me i smiled when it showed gameplay of the mission no Russian
17975,"I'm not a senstive guy but i did skip no russian, no civilians bro haha"
17976,"Funny how conservatives like to blame everything except easy access to weapons for mass shootings.  By their philosophy, we should ban violence in movies, songs, shows and video games before we even think about restricting the access of weapons actually used in the crimes."
17977,"Video games are harmless. I think any person, media host, or politician that wants to take that away and thinks video games are a threat is a stupid and is a pathetic excuse."
17978,How the hell can Doom be satanic when the game has you fighting AGAINST demons -- not with them?
17979,Video games will break the TV in your living room.
17980,greedy add bullshit auto thumbs down and don't try to bullshit me and say they have no control because that isn't true
17981,What about Hatred?
17982,"I met Jim Boone about two months before Saints Row IV was released.  He was pretty much exactly like that the whole time.  The stand out, for me, was during a presentation he gave about the development cycle.  Specifically, how they'd handled the takeover at Deep Silver.  He said, I'm certain not in jest, that Deep Silver were surprised at the beer budget the Volition guys needed for staff meetings.
Jim Boone is a fucking BOSS"
17983,politicians = over paid pieces of shit
17984,"Yeah so, people lose their kids in wars and that is acceptable and away from criticism but making a pc game about it deserves all the shitstorm. thats foxnews."

17988,-who is innocent? no one is innocent who is innocent -
17989,the most controversial blow back?? WINNER GOES TO MANHUNT!!!
17990,man I hate sensitive pussies
17991,"All of them. Censorship is BS and shouldn't exist. Give the game a rating and make those ratings more strictly followed and enforced and allow game developers to put whatever the hell they want in their games so long as it has a rating prior to release. This society is backwards. Show any kind of extreme violence, no matter how brutal on TV and it's perfectly fine. Show nudity of women on TV and all hell breaks loose but nude men is always ok for some damn reason. Show nudity and/or Violence on Video games and the whole country is turned upside down. Way too many double standards and hypocrisy surrounding the whole censorship of violence and nudity and the relation between the two."
17992,the guy at 5:30 started talking devil at the end
17993,Hmm I think DOOM is anti Satanic because your mission is to destroy Satan and his minions. Therefore making it the opposite of Satanic.
17994,My ass itches....
17995,Seriously?
17996,Can people just leave my fucking video games alone instead of taking a shit on them and blaming them for violence because that is complete bullshit. I mean if movies and tv shows can have scenes realistic of war or terrorists then why can't video games.
17997,"Damnit, I hate how people can be so fucking sensitive. You can't ban everything because someone does not likes it. That's how democracy and freedom of speech works. If you don't like it, don't listen, don't play it and don't bother. You can't stop doing stuff just because someone is taking an offense to it. In the end someone is always gonna get offended and butthurt. You can't please every individual. It's impossible."
17998,I believe the way these kids act is 99% based on how their parents raised them and what mental disorders their parents have..

18003,What is the name of the game on 3:28
18004,I still laugh how people we're so sour over hatred. Haha
18005,"Now don't get me wrong I understand some of these arguments but it was actually through the history conveyed to me by games that I've developed into a history major. In some examples yes the games can be disrespectful and calls for concern but in many others they are an outlet to give interesting and immersive takes on teaching history. 
Obviously a recent and most notable example being Battlefield 1, while not ALL of it was accurate, it was very close and still enough to spark interest in some of it's player base. I can respect games that are willing to step into war stories and work with veterans to get their stories heard. They can just as much be an outlet to open up the world of history and the horror as well as the honor of war as it is to making light of it. It's all based on the approach of the developer and should never EVER be the stereotype for all games in the genre."
18006,"haha it all makes sense now, people who are too old to play video games dont want anyone else to play them"
18007,"Wow, the media is really hellbent on making stuff look bigger than it already is."

18012,all i can say is at least i dont live in gernamy
18013,"Sometimes I hate being Australian, so many amazing games banned."
18014,"A lot of people mistake correlation for causation in the instance of video games and violence.  Correlation means two things happen at the same time, but are not necessarily related, like if you were driving and it starts to rain.  Neither caused the other, but they still happened at the same time.  Causation is pretty self explanatory.  A is directly related to B, and one causes the other.  
While video games can cause violent behavior, that's only if you play from a very early age in development (3- about 12) or if you were already had a predisposition towards violence, in which case a game wouldn't be the cause.  In the first case, that's the fault of negligent parents not bothering to see that M rated games should be played by a group that their children are not a part of.  In the second, a game will not be the straw that breaks the camels back.
So, basically, stop.  Video games do not cause violence."
18015,Mass Effect Sex Scenes > GTA Franchise sex scenes WTF !

18019,"Old people today complain about video games and rap music in the same way their elders complained to them about Elvis, Chuck Berry, and Rock'n'Roll.  We'll probably end up complaining about ""all these darn kids and their VR's and their holograms, and their hoverboards"". It's a never ending cycle."

18022,"Your son died in the Battle of Fallujah so you don't want a fucking video game made? Well FUCK YOU, you fat diabetic tub of goo. If your son was one of a handful of guys who was killed in that battle and you can't deal with it, then what about the MILLIONS of people that lost a loved one in WW2??? Or WW1? Or Vietnam? Or any fucking war throughout time? There's no problem with umpteen games being made per year on any of those wars/battles, but you have a gripe because your dumbass son got killed and you don't like it and what someone to blame? Oh yea well, 'my ancestry traces its roots back to Carthage, and my people were wiped out, therefore FUCK Rome Total War'. What a fucking cunt. Go crawl into a cave, on Mars, with your eyes closed and your ears plugged."

18026,Made In 2016+ = 1. Tracers Butt (Overwatch)
18027,"way I see it, if a game has a controversy behind it, then it must be good."
18028,FIFA doesn't make the current generation into Football. I don't get why the hell apparently playing Pokemon and having my favorite Pokemon as Jynx would turn me misogynist racist witch. Some people really do have low intelligence. Mainly Fox news reporters.
18029,Ever notice how the people in media always blame stuff that their demographic isn't in to as to the cause of mass shootings?
18030,"An adult goes on a shooting rampage, it's a tragedy. A young teen kills one person in self defense, and the media blows it out of proportion because the teens plays first person shooters. This is the world we live in. Some people are fucking idiots."
18031,This is why the media should stay out of games for the most part
18032,"The ""Six Days in Fallujah"" controversy seems odd to me. Perhaps it was being developed too soon after the actual conflict, but World War II Veterans were unable to prevent numerous FPS's based on their own battles from being released. Plus, having actual Marines help with the project? Sounds like the developers were taking it seriously."
18033,"What about every person who says anything along the lines of ""video games rot your brain"", ""video games make you fat"", or ""video games make all people violent"" (you think there were a lot of video games during the revolutionary war?)"
18034,"I just can't even tolerate watching the ""violent video games make people violent"" stories of conservative news outlets. It is always an absolute bombshell to them when someone who commits a mass shooting has a violent video game at home and immediately, that is the cause. Rather than saying that a majority of young males play games like Call of Duty and GTA and these types of shootings are usually carried out by young males. ""We just discovered that the alleged shooter masturbates twice a day. Does masturbation cause you to become a violent psychopath?!?"""
18035,notice none of the sexist attacks on women by these sad geeks is mentioned
18036,"Oh my God, I watched the BrainScratchComms crew(with Amanda in tow) play Pokemon Black and Blue, and I find all the controversy about Pokemon absolute bullshit."
18037,"Most of these are just from whiny old people who've never played a video game in their life.  Take the fat chick at 5:08 for example - I'd be unsurprised if she calls everything a ""Nintendo."""
18038,Did I just see Dana Plato?
18039,PETA making a fake online games of the Pokmon franchise? PETA is messed up because of that.
18040,Senators and politicians getting butthurt over video games WITH RATINGS AND WARNINGS ON THEM rather than talking and engaging in things actually important. God bless this world...
18041,screw those who think video games cause mass killings and shootouts
18042,"5:10
Your son did have that choice. He chose to enlist."
18043,"These news outlets try so hard to dissuade people from getting the games but really, it's free advertisement as some companies want the media coverage and even design trailers to purposely attract it like with Hatred and Hitman Absolution from what I remember."
18044,U can still get the uncensored version of Manhunt 2 on pc
18045,that was Kimberly from diff strokes.
18046,"If Violent videogames makes us violent then simulation games supposed to make us better drivers, pilots, farmers, surgeons. Survival games make us better survivors in dire situation and so on."
18047,Dammit some people are so fucking sensitive
18048,Jesus Christ the stupidity in the news reports is unreal
18049,"6:22 ""KILL PPL"" lmao"
18050,"In Mass Effect, you can play as a girl and have sex with as many guys as you want."
18051,The Pokmon controversy was the dumbest and just pisses me off. They Blame Pokmon for Satanism just because it's a little magical. Dumb excuse
18052,I literally just came here for Kim.
18053,foxnews is stupid
18054,"The only game I don't like that has been announced this year is a game where it bases heavily on satanic beliefs, I don't know what its called, but it is gory, satanic, and nasty all in one. I don't like a tiny bit (That's not true I like the graphics, they perty)"
18055,why do you censor things?
18056,THESE SHOULD NOT BE BANNED
18057,0/10. No Hatred or No Russian
18058,mw3 is better
18059,"Videos Games should not be controversial. They are GAMES. Just because I can kill or torture someone in a game does not at all mean I'm gonna go out and do it in real life. I know very well the difference between real life and a video game. News agencies are so stupid, if they actually believe that video games are the cause of mass shootings and killing and torturing people, then they need to be evaluated for a mental sickness. The idea of mass killings and torture and rape and all the above has been around for thousands of years, it didn't just become a thing because of some video games."
18060,"Hey American Conservatives, instead of blaming mass shootings on video games, how about BANNING GUNS?!?!"
18061,you forgot the <censored> who think games are sexist or bigoted because 'the hero is always a white man'
18062,I cringed on the call of duty mission
18063,I never shot a single bullet in No russian mission. On civillians i mean. I managed to kill Makarov few times with Mission failed outcome though.
18064,"My parents won't let me play gta because apparently they saw a news report about how all you do is ""rape women"" like no you don't do that, remember don't listen to the news when it comes to video games"
18065,Fox needs to die in a hole.
18066,"This controversy annoys the hell out of me. They paint us all as sadistic, satanic worshipping,  violent psychopaths. Just because someone enjoys FPS like Bioshock, COD, etc doesn't mean they're gonna whip out a gun and start shooting random people. Same for any game. I do not get sudden murderous urges when I play video games, nor do I in everyday life. It doesn't happen like that. I swear these people just like to complain about video games for the purpose of it existing. I won't be surprised if they find something ""controversial"" about a Barbie computer game."
18067,They need to know that it is easy to pull the trigger because we actually know that it's JUST A GAME!
18068,They need to leave our violent video games alone. It actually  helps with anger issues.
18069,the fuck
18070,"i find it amusing how people get so upset about gamesl,it's as if you banned a book for it's story based on fiction."
18071,"They need to stop blaming games for what people who are just straight up psychopaths do, if games like this were the cause for a lot of the things that happened then every last gamer, like myself on the planet would be doing it. Clearly idiots seem to have more ground than the truth and facts."
18072,I think that pastor was confusing Pokemon with YuGiOh lol
18073,Didn't Manhunt 2 come out on the PSP instead of the PS2?
18074,Fuck Jack Thompson
18075,"God, why do people hate video games?! In fact, here is a message to all people who hate video games... 
You're a bunch of fucking shmucks!!!"
18076,WTF australians have a lot of dangerous animals and other stuff like that and they complaint for a simple video game
18077,wait so why isint there any shit given for WW2 games? Or is there? Cuz alot of people died on all sides in that...
18078,It boggles my mind how people can complain about video games being violent and yet support kids looking at incredibly violent classical art...like a crucifix
18079,Lol...all the contrevercies are made up by AMERITARDS
18080,"Hillary Clinton? seriously, like she is going to pass some video game control law anytime soon, because i dont need to be going to a background check every time i buy  a rated M video game."
18081,now pokemon is fucked up were allowing little kids to go out and enslaveing pokemons to beat up there own blood or kind and forceing them to fight each other for money or fame some and then its rinse and repeat
18082,I HATE THSE BASTERDS THAT TRY TO TELL PEOPLE THAT A CERTIN GAME IS BAD FUCK THEM
18083,I LOVE the no Russian mission! Just mow everybody down and don't give one shit! :D
18084,"Watchmojo needs to make ""Another top 10 game controversies"" listand add Tracer's butt pose from Overwatch."
18085,"I don't want my nephew to play ""No Russian"" mission!"
18086,"I'm trying to prove to this woman that video games don't cause violence.
Can someone give me some tips on how to deal with her?"
18087,Pokemon has no big contreversy.
18088,When hotline maimi is illegal and manhunt in Australia great what is my cousin gonna say
18089,Fox News? Does anyone even take them seriously anymore?
18090,GTA UNLIKE POKEMON IS NOT FUCKING POKEMON
18091,3:42 !!! Kim!! Yay!
18092,"this is why manhunt sucks cause parents and the British counsel ruined the game for everyone and the PC version of the game is now only available at Amazon but for PS2, Wii and PSP owners have to mod the game and remove a fucking patch to get all the good stuff, my opinion just stick to manhunt 1 on PS2 and Xbox"
18093,"I really hate how video games get so much controversy by parents, video games have nothing to do with violent behavior, it's the choices we make in life cause God gave us free will and people need to know kids just need to play whatever video game they want like call of duty, halo, manhunt and GTA and get it over with and get back to there normal lives like going to elementary school and shitting there pants and getting a frowny face on their report card"
18094,"If every American who played GTA went on a rampage, everyone would be dead. Literally. That is to say video games are not the cause of these mass shootings."
18095,Most of these stories are complete bullshit conside
18096,What about Sad Satan? That actually has real violence and cp! It's a video game on the deep web!
18097,vice city with the haitian controversy?
18098,There would have to be something already wrong with you for a video game to turn you in a murderous machine.
18099,10 is just a crazy feminist
18100,ITS JUST A FUCKING VIDEO GAME!!!!
18101,I am surprised that the controversy between India and the Fallout series (Brahmin Incident) didn't make it on the list.
18102,"Why the fuck was there controversy around #4? Ya'll dumbasses like to play Call of Duty all the time, you know they're based on a lot of real wars too?"
18103,because Six Days in Fallujah would have been any different then Cod or Battlefield
18104,"Once I saw Fox News make a chart of 10-15 mass shooters who all played video games and, of course, they blamed the games. This is so stupid because I could make a chart of MILLIONS of people who played violent games and are completely fine."
18105,This is the most disappointed channel on YouTube
18106,How the f*ck do they get the Guns in the first place
18107,Also doom
18108,I like manhunt because I play it
18109,5:04 I played that before
18110,I dont give a shit anymore since government and ''humans'' get too ''Offended''on simple things..a game is just a game nothing more..they're making it all full-blown and stupid But if they dare touch my visual novels im gonna go and raise hell
18111,"To be fair, Night Trap is a terrible game"
18112,"What gives me comfort is that all of these older people will eventually die, and society will move on without these fossilized old puppets contaminating the air with gripes about video games"
18113,I've always hated Fox news and Hillary Clinton and this is exactly why.
18114,"The Pokemon controversy, gets me every time. Because in Pokemon when you knock a Pokemon out it doesn't say ""Foe's Nidoran died!"" (only in the over-dramatic Creepypastas) it says ""Foe's NIdoran fainted""! Not to mention there's no blood and guts and you can heal them to full health. As for the Satanic thing, a lot of Pokemon are based off of legends, myths, actual animals, and people themselves, like Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee. Not to mention religion itself like how Arceus represents God, and Giratina representing the Devil."
18115,"Its funny, I used this video to write a Pro Gaming speech for my English speaking exam and I got 27/30 and an A. :D. Thanks guys"
18116,I bet ISIS members play tons of  games
18117,watch dogs teaches children to hack--FOX News
18118,"I like how they #1 is spoken by ""Conservative"" parties. It's liberals nowadays. I can't buy a rated T game anymore without am id. I'm fucking 20 years old! That shut about Hillary Clinton I can understand 100% though"
18119,I feel like at some point someone is going to hate on Halo or something because it has evil aliens and it 'might offend the space aliens'
18120,Rockstar Games is a prone to controversy
18121,"Anyone on the news who talk bad about video games, never trust them."
18122,"This just shows how inferior and stupid politicians and journalists are. I mean, number 3 probably sounds like an American extremists wet dream to me."
18123,I swear people just need to come down
18124,"Call the castrator, because there's a lot of pussies needing to be removed from this earth."
18125,"'Remember, no rushin'.''
Walks through airport very slowly"
18126,"I buy and play all the controversial games because they're controversial, and it's been that way since I was 14 (I'm 36 now) and I've never committed any violent crimes. I feel like I'm missing out."
18127,The one with gta how did a mod/hack make it banned
18128,The Non gamers think video games turn us into violent killing machines thats not true its just some people are fucked up and happened to have played games so they just look for something to blame instead of creating change
18129,"I gotta agree with #4 it was sorta offensive i think games should stay in the realms of fiction because that mother was right, we get to start over, but he didn't..."
18130,The Columbine Doom blame? Or did manson take more of the blame?
18131,"I don't know why people made sex inaproppriate. It is a completely normal thing that people do, why is it so bad? Anyways, people thought they can hide it from kids, but a ton of authors make teen books which reflex on the theme. As far as I know, sex will be a completely normal thing in the near future."
18132,"REALLY!?! OH YEAH, I'M TOTALLY GONNA' PLAY MW2, AND  NOT REALIZE THAT IT'S MORALLY WRONG TO KILL SOMEONE FOR NO REASON!!! OH HEY WHILE YOU'RE AT IT WHY NOT ADD ALMOST EVERY SINGLE GAME MARKETED TO ADULTS IN EXISTENCE TO THE LIST!"
18133,most of these complaints were from parents who let 7 year olds that play mature games like come on people
18134,"I hate when people fail to remember one of the basic rules of science: Correlation DOES NOT equal causation. Just because someone who shoots up a school or something was obsessed with video games, that has NOTHING to do with the shooting itself. Clearly that person was messed up in the head regardless of any influence from video games."
18135,i dont know y i clicked this video. i knew it would make me mad...
18136,"Violent video games are the reason for violence in the real world wow... I thought the 21st century was supposed to be more advanced than the others. I was wrong. There are SO many other reasons why this happens. But of course they blame it on the one thing they can get rid of, video games. What about psychological issues? Frustration so bad that they resort to violence? Thank god my friends all like what I like. or else I might Mass shooting them :/"
18137,Videogames are there to relieve stress & feel accomplishment they almost never lead to actual crimes they are more of a way to express yourself & have a skill in something
18138,"Typical to blame games ,yet millions of retards are out there everyday being slaves to their phones ,walking blindly in the street ,texting and driving ."
18139,We all knew MW2 was gonna be on here
18140,I had a feeling that grand theft auto would be on the list.
18141,great episode
18142,A few guys who play video games shoot up a school and murder people and all of a sudden all video games are evil. Everybody who said video games lead to real-life violence forget one small thing: THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO PLAY VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES WHO DON'T FUCKING KILL PEOPLE.
18143,okay
18144,"Screw you, Michael Atkinson, how DARE you ban Fallout 3..."
18145,the 9 feel like ridiculous
18146,Remember-No Russian
18147,"If people bitch about what games we play, then why do they buy them for their kids?"
18148,what's the game at 3:28
18149,"Glad I don't live in Australia, god damn Nanny state!!"
18150,These people who complain about stupid things should get themselves a f*cking life.
18151,3:46 It's Kim!!
18152,"i mean SERIOUSLY!? australia isnt any smart banned phantasmagoria for its ""graphic violence"" MY ASS! rate it +18 and unban it godamnit just dumb people! fir fuck sake"
18153,"I hate how media blows it all out of proportion like Jesus give it a fucking rest & shut up,sorry video games evolved beyond tetris & fucking Pac-Man 
on topic:surprised to not see Dantes inferno for the killing of un-baptised babies or dead space 2 for also being able to kill necromorphed babies & children"
18154,"my name is russel
isis promised me muscles
now I hustle
to the airport in Brussels"
18155,"maniacs and mental people who go on a killing shooting rampage at airports, schools and other places have been doing this way before violent games were even made hell they were doing it way before any video games were ever made, it's not like a kid is gonna kill a guy in a game and go hey let's go kill my family, politicians probably pay  families millions of dollars and have their kids go out and commit a shooting killing rampage and tell the family to blame it on video games and tell the family to keep quiet about everything"
18156,if games are a precursor to violence and a gateway to kids committing murder there would be 6x more killing and murders ever years polictions and senators are just making a big deal because they just want to make money and get into the spotlight and want to take video games off the market so they can control every aspect of kids lives
18157,"Man that bitch from Fox news was a cunt, hope that bitch gets breast cancer... I guess we can't make games about important historical events, even though movie studios make movies about this kind of shit ALL the time and most of the time it is completely changed to be fictional.... God forbid we actually have a realistic depiction of a modern event."
18158,"oh look that guy killed someone it MUST be a games fault
fuckin idots"
18159,"I knew ""no russian"" would be here lol"
18160,"Liberal media are the new enemy of gamers; see #GamerGate
Anita Sarkeesian is the new Jack Thompson anyone who doesn't admit this is either retarded or a faggot; both of them suck and need to go away. Keep both the liberals and conservatives out of gaming; it's art, it's 1st Amendment issue in the US, no more bullshit liberal or conservative, I don't care."
18161,"As gamers, we cannot deny the fact that video games are influential and caused people who are mentally ill or troubled to create shootings. But we can deny in the media's faces that video games are not at fault when something like a shootout happens. Cause if video games are at fault, and all the games featured here are popular. Wont there be crimes happening every few minutes or so with people saying they were inspired by a game to do."
18162,"against violence video games but against gun control.. I'm ""confuse"".."
18163,it real aggravates me when i hear how shooter games are being blamed for mass killings. i play shooters all the time and i've never wanted to shoot anything up.
18164,What music is this called? 0:05
18165,Weapons dont kill people. Video games does. Is that the lesson?
18166,"I'm sorry world public....my country (USA) has a bunch of high up pussies, all of us normal gamers apologize for them"
18167,"Remember, no russian"
18168,"5:20 Funny how Fox News says, ""some people lost their children in that battle"" while there are hundreds of games set on WW2. Battle of Stalingrad itself killed 2 million soldiers and more than 20000 civilians. Necessary to talk about the entire war? I don't think so.
If that's the case, is it justified to criticize games because ""some"" people lose their children while many other games depict wars in which, obviously, more than ""some"" people lose their own lives and their children's lives?"
18169,OF COURSE ROOM IS SATANIC!!! THE OBJECTIVE IS TO GO TO HELL AND KILL THE MOTHERFUCKING DEVIL!!!
18170,I'm kinda surprised that the Baptism scene from Bioshock Infinite didn't make the list.
18171,Anybody know what song is in the intro/ 4: six days fallujah?
18172,"If playing skyrim doesn't make me an adventurer, and assassins creed doesn't make me an an assassin, why do people talk shit about call of duty making me a murderer?"
18173,the fox news guy they kept showing in this works for msnbc now xD
18174,"For anyone who still may think violent video games are to blame, take a look at some side-by-side data: ever since video game violence became realisitic (let's just say it started with Mortal Kombat back in 1992, even though we know splattering a liter of blood every time someone gets punched is insanely unrealistic), actual violence has dropped. No, this does NOT mean there's a link between gaming violence and the drop, but it's worth studying more. It bears asking hypothetically: does virtual violence actually lead to less real violence?"
18175,what is the music in 4: Six days in Fallujah?
18176,"Well, Australia has Saints Row 4 now so I guess our governmentfinally gainedasence of humor."
18177,3:21 Thanks to this jerk.
18178,humanity never fails to impress me... and disappoint me at the same time...
18179,FOX News people!
18180,ffs there games that all
18181,this people need to get a life there just game ffs
18182,You can buy the uncensored manhunt 2 on amazon for like 15 bucks as a digital download :P http://www.amazon.com/Rockstar-Manhunt-2-Download/dp/B00CMSCT8Y
18183,"my dear (mostly) american friends, u should stop playing video games or u gonna get yourself hurt!"
18184,god i hate the news
18185,"Yeah and that's one of the most broken things in today's world. Sex, as completely natural part of life, is more demonized and is much bigger taboo than violence, killing, hurting people. That's just fckd up."
18186,"Something allways needs to take the blame for all the world's problems ... Rock music, movies, comics and today it's video games. It's ridiculous. Especially if you consider how common videogames are today. 
Of course, blaming games is much more convenient and easier then blaming the real problems behind such things like mass shootings."
18187,"I notice Fox news is holding the pitch fork on a lot of these ""controversies."" Does it really count if the only people upset at your game are the religious zealots who encourage actual violence in the middle east?"
18188,"Scandal: When youtubers take another youtuber's video, uses most of the same clips, and keeps almost exactly the same structure, only omitting 4 of the scandals reviewed."
18189,before I watch the video I think no Russian will be first
18190,I lost respect for COD with that No Russian Part. FACE IT! Some people can not distinguish between game play and reality. Nothat's not your fault and maybe you can. But that is still irresponsible (at best) for the gaming company to put that out there. Any way Im very surprised that the new DLC for Assassins Creed hasn't come under fire.Not trying to race baitor anything but its about the Haitian Revolution.To put it crassly its aHaitian (Black)mankilling Frenchsoldiers fortheirfreedom. I thought white folks would be up in arms. With that being said I cant wait to play it lol
18191,"Fuck it man. The theory of video gaming makes people more offensive and violent is obsolete. There are numerous reasons that can make people become a monster and even more ways to prevent them, not just banning a video game. Here's an advice ; take care of your own fucking kids and watch them, not blaming other things that would make you look like a total piece of shit."
18192,was that woman speaking on mass effect a hard done by feminist crusader or what!?! .. you can play the game as a woman FFS!
18193,"what the fuck?!?!  ,even pixelated game cencored to? what the fuck did watchmojo think? huh?  fuck ur videos man...  top 10 memes is the best!!!"
18194,I hate Pokemon controversy
18195,"Don't listen to Hilary Clinton! All she says is ,""take out the garbage ""!"
18196,I bet all school shooters drank milk when they were babies. MAYBE MILK IS LINKED TO VIOLENCE! BAN ALL MILK!
18197,"I'm a U.S. Marine Afghan Vet, and even though I wasn't in the Battle of Fallujah, a few friends of mine and a few of my drill instructors in boot camp where, and I find the fact that they cancelled a game about the battle total liberal bullshit. You don't see WW2 vets complaining about all of the call of duty games do you? What about Vietnam vets? Do you hear them complaining about the Nam games? No. Know why? Because as Vets, we honestly don't give a shit. The only people butthurt enough to care are the politicians and media most of the time. We would love to see our fallen brothers immortalized forever in a game that showed exactly how the battle unfolded, and showed the courage and willingness to win that led our guys to victory. They even said that they where collaborating with survivors of the battle to help make the game more realistic, do you think those guys had a problem? I love my country, but we are so full of pansies nowadays."
18198,Lol people complain about the stupidest damn things
18199,love it... blame virtual guns... forget about the gun culture America has hahaha... the lack of regulations totally isnt the reason its all cuz of video games ha !
18200,need to update with gamergate xD
18201,"the game hatred should be on here then although im not sure if it ever did get released, I just remember seeing a real messed up trailer for it."
18202,Dam media leave  video games to the experts
18203,I actually agree that Pokemon World is a world of the demonic.
18204,"I will simply say video games don't cause shootings retards, if I am mad at somebody I will go home and play grand theft auto for a couple hours and just relax because I took out my anger on the computer people in the game."
18205,Americans can buy a weapon easier than a pair of shoes!! And suddenly videogames have to take the blame??
18206,lmao some ppl are so fuckin stupid
18207,i played the torture mission in gta 5 i played the mw2 missions the day they came out 2 or 3 days later u forgot about them like wtf
18208,you can still download manhunt 2 uncensored haha get your info right in unsubbing
18209,"In the words of quintin Tarantino, ""I'm not responsible for what a crazy person does"" and neither are video games."
18210,ppl r so sensitive now adays
18211,What video games have they been playing for the last 3000 years because those religious nutcases have been going at it for that long...
18212,Yes.. the russian part pissed me off i told myself: i am a special agent why the fuck am i killing innocent people?!?!?
18213,Video Games will always be used as a scapegoat for killers with mental illnesses
18214,They find a way to put Portal on any fucking list.
18215,"Does anyone remember when Sans was put on some news network because some crack-head thought he looked ""satanic"". I mean he's in fucking 8-bit"
18216,"GTA: You gun down an entire city one person at a time - that's ok. You show animated characters having sex - moral ""authorities"" go insane. When will the censorship grow up?"
18217,gta is the most high fucked up game for kids!
18218,I don't like this game so no one should be able to play it -all the assholes
18219,"video games like this are great if it weren't for violent video games I would actually do it on some people I hate! instead I can play pretend and do it again and again!
seriously video games like this help a lot of people relieve stress! but I can see how other people might view it definitely wouldn't buy son or daughter a game like that until they were at least over 12"
18220,they put nine of my favorite games and they say pokemon teachs WITCHCRAFT. how much drugs have they taken?
18221,Pretty much all the media complaining is FOX.
18222,"3 steps Jack Thompson needs to fallow.
1. Buy a dildo.
2. Go home and unbox it.
3. Fuck himself with said dildo."
18223,Controversy is just a bunch of assholes assholing around and ruining things if you don't like something don't get involved with it it's that simple seriously.
18224,why artist of mortal combat not imprisoned
18225,"hopefully they realize movies, music, home life, etc. can do just as much damage as a video game. What's next? Are we going to be banned from watching movies, listening to music, or even being at home alone without a police officer there so everyone is under watch.  Chill. People are driven to violence in different ways. Some might be movies, games, or even someone tying their shoe incorrectly. stop putting the blame on one thing and open your eyes to reality."
18226,Even as religious person I found the Pokemon controversy magnet to be satanic very cringy
18227,I was in Fallujah and I still want to play Six Days in Fallujah.
18228,So you think video games promote violent? Tell me again about how religion is a better path?
18229,The Fallujah game was really just made at the wrong time.  If they had made it now there probably wouldn't be much controversy.
18230,My goodness me. Fox News prolly has the lowest credibility when it comes to news. They suck. They over exaggerate shit all they time. Fucks sake
18231,wow people over react these days what's next Minecraft most violent game of the year?
18232,"I'm just gonna throw this out there, but does anyone find it a bit odd that games where nameless, faceless people are murdered are considered controversial, but a game like The Godfather where literally EVERYONE has a unique name, and it kinda makes you feel like a real murderer, aren't considered controversial at all?"
18233,"oh no we cant show sex in video games, it should only be on the internet. And oh no we cant show violence, even though you can just get R-rated movies when ever you want. Americans are dumb"
18234,Fox News is a really funny all day news comedy
18235,Australia's game rating absurd its up to parents to decide what their kid plays
18236,"Overreacting people...there games. I see the point in maybe one or two but come on. Video games are not the issue or the cause of what other people do, its there choice to do stupid and horrible shit. Not a games or anything else."
18237,no Russian FTW
18238,"I'm so tired of everyone being butt-hurt over everything. HOLY FUCK THEIR GAMES. Pokemon has nothing to do with witchcraft, a game about Fallujah would of been a learning opportunity if it would of been as historically accurate as they made it seem it would of been. news flash your son knew damn well he could die when he signed up. and before someone comments about that I am joining the USMC so save it."
18239,fucking PETA and pokeymon xD
18240,cmon watchmojo... fox news wasn't the ONLY news broadcast Corp to bitch about games. remove you biasisms out of your videos
18241,Final clip from Global News in Toronto.
18242,always bashing fox news and conservatives... why so biased? fuck u liberals
18243,"I believe that games are very controversial. Remember the Columbine shootings? Well the two students who committed their crimes were fans of the game, Doom, and I read that the killers said while they were shooting up the school ""it will be just like Doom"". So I also believe that games can pose as a threat."
18244,"4:58
I hate this woman.  That's the ""Freedom"" millions of soldiers died to maintain. You being against that is far more offensive and insulting to their memory than a fucking video game."
18245,"People complaining about gta, like what did people buy it for kids without thinking about anything?  ""Hmm, rated m?  Is that the brand?""  And really?  Gonna complain about a newer war game?  What about desert storm for the win95?  Red Alert? Those are war games.  And I can get on WoW, go into a random alli town and start mass killing civilian NPCs, so what's the problem with CoD snce it's optional as well?"
18246,5:52 What.... The... Fuck...
18247,"What I'm mainly getting from this video is that American government thinks its people to be so weak-willed and soft that a quest from a (and I emphasize here)  VIDEOGAME, could trigger violence in younger population. Not the legality and easy availability of weapons, not the faulty educational system, not the increased social pressure to fit, but a fucking quest in a videogame. Jesus fucking christ."
18248,ocarina of time had Muslim chants in the fire temple
18249,"Games don't make violence!!!! Unless we are talking about Dota, LoL or Cs:Go."
18250,Now i know what the real enemy of gaming is.........Fox news
18251,"I live in Australia, and the R18+ rating was introduced here in video games for one of the reasons being GTA V.
If GTA V had not been like it is, the R18+ rating might not have even come to video games in Australia."
18252,"Yeah, mass shootings happen because of video games. Totally not because every fucking 16 year old moron can buy a gun."
18253,ABACABB
18254,"Video Games are not the blame for any kind of massacre or shooting that happened. Millions of people play GTA and cod all the time and millions of people have remained mentally stable. If someone commits a serious crime after recently playing a violent game, who's fault do you think that is? The criminal for not realizing that it's fiction, or the game for providing entertainment in the form of violence?"
18255,In cod modern warfare 2 at the start of no Russian it says that people may find it offensive
18256,"oh shit someone made a violent game
better put it on the news"
18257,"If Some games are banned in Australia from being sold, is it illegal to have them if you got them from somewhere else?"
18258,Six Days in Fallujah looked friggen promising...
18259,I think self control and parents advised
18260,"I remember when gore picked lieberman as his running mate and its as if you could hear the entire  gaming community say ""fuck this guy""."
18261,"people always want to blame something else for 1 person's or a hand full of people's actions. Yes Doom was Satanic. Yes Mortal Kombat was extremely violent for its time. There may be people out there that can't differentiate between fantasy and reality. They need help, not censorship. At least the generation that thought that games need censorship will be dying off before long, and leave we open-minded people to make the call."
18262,"""AND it's VERY realistic""
Fox News is at it again, because bringing multiple machine guns and assault rifles into an airport and taking on an entire police force with four guys is pretty realistic"
18263,You barely touched video game addiction.
18264,There should be an examination before playing video games. -_-
18265,Whats the soundtrack at 3:50 ?
18266,"Bob:""Hey you know that guy that killed someone? "" Person:""What guy?"" Bob:""That guy who killed all of those 1st graders at that school."" Person:""Oh, you mean the video games."" Bob:""No, I mean the guy."" Person:""What did the guy do? The video games made him do it."" Bob:""But video games can't talk."" Person:""But the news lady sa-"" Bob:""They lied to you."" Person:""Oh."" Bob:""That guy is going to prison for that."" Person:""But he still didn't do it."" Bob:""Why?"" Person:""If the video games didn't do it, than clearly it was the gun he was holding."" Bob:""How would a gun make someone kill people?"" Person:""It told him to."" Bob:""That's impossible, guns can't talk."" Person:""But the news la--"" Bob:""They lied to you about that too."" Person:""Damn it."" Person:""So it was the guy that killed the people all along?"" Bob:""Yes."" Person:""But why?"" Bob:""Because he is mentally ill."" Person:""Ok.""
The discussion between someone who OBEYS the news, and someone who has common sense."
18267,you know what i'm gonna say it  i don't care that you broke your elbow.
18268,that war game sounds amazing
18269,What about Hatred?
18270,"okay first of all, it's a game, you can just say ""oh my son died in war so this game ain't good."" I feel bad for people dieing in war but we don't ban call of duty, battlefield or any other shooter but we ban Six days in Fallujah....? it's a bunch a fucking bullshit that over the slightest things that can get banned in countries or just any where to be exact!"
18271,top fuck jack Thomson
18272,Mass Effect allows its players to engage in the most realistic sex acts ever conceived LOLOL!! The hot coffee mod of san andreas offers more 'realistic' sex scenes than mass effect...:D
18273,people will always find something to blame and its video games of course.
18274,"doom is satanic u fight demons, and custards revenge looks like fun."
18275,no Russian is the greatest level on mw2.
18276,Konami os a bunch of pussys. that would've been dope.
18277,"Games has nothing to do with a bunch of psychopathic pricks. A game cannot turn you crazy wanting to gun down people, what the fuck? They purely exist for entertainment but of course a bunch of fucking idiots will blame games because they need someone/thing to blame, no, it's not any game's fault. That is 100% bullshit."
18278,this games is fun and funny sometimes
18279,"people its just a video game its not relife its better to kill /slaughter/ rape or anything u can bitch about, its better to do it in the virtual world than real life"
18280,They cant do shit to gun manufacturers or the porn industry because if you fuck with them they have actual guns...But go after the people who create and play video games because most of them are nerds xD.....I see you
18281,Media criticizes gaming communities because gaming has become more popular
18282,Then there is Hatred.. Which you basically kill a bunch of innocent people. I have to say that one is a little intense. But video games don't cause violence. They put those rating on there for a reason. An 8 year old honestly shouldn't be playing GTA. I play GTA and go on a cop killing spree with my friends but does that make me want to go out and actually kill cops. No.
18283,"Fucking hell, the American media is so sickeningly hysterical..."
18284,This was a good list
18285,"Lmfao it would be fox news to go on videogames, they're all a bunch of retards. People get offended over EVERYTHING now, pussies."
18286,"Yeah I remember when people thought Pokemon was evil. I went to private Christian school and they went overboard by not only banning Pokemon cards and anything related to it anywhere in the school, but also taking the opportunity to ban Yugioh and Harry Potter along with it. Their reasoning behind it was if that some people found it controversial, they had to change the rules to accomodate everyone. Even back then I thought it was ridiculous, even without knowing much about Pokemon at all. But it got me thinking. I probably wouldn't have so interested if I had't wanted to find what it really was, and I started watching the show. Now I love it, and hell I'm wearing a Pikachu T-shirt right now."
18287,"If they want us to stop playing video games, ok then...
Brings my sledge hammer
NOW I CAN USE THIS IN REAL LIFE"
18288,Amercians are hypocrites - 80 million people (the whole population of my homeland) have together 300 million weapons and call videogames the reason for shoot outs -.-  Here those videogame things even don't get shown in the news.
18289,"People who say that video games, movies, and tv cause violence are STUPID! What is in movies and video games are not REAL! Get it through your heads people!"
18290,Reservoir dogs!
18291,The Nintendo DS pictochat increased child molester rates
18292,"Ah, Fox News... fuck you and anyone who likes you."
18293,"it still shocks me how dumb some people are, games are for the entertainment and are not to blame for some peoples mental issues, but hey, the old cunts and good human beings (and of course the media people with a brain that doesn't work)  who probably dont even now what a game is and never touched one before know better than the rest of the world. I bet they think that games are a product by satan  himself because their little brain isn't capable of understanding what fun and entertainment is"
18294,notice most the news is Fox news
18295,"Manhunt 2 is an awesome game, hard to complete too"
18296,"No Russian was one of the most uncomfortable mission i've ever played when i was 14. i skipped it and was quite upset playing it and didn't play it for about a year because it was just so destructive and trumatizing for a 14 year old. i've played it a couple times and i still hate playing it. why did they need to include it, i'm not sure, but the saving grace was that it was skippable."
18297,I love how its always Fox
18298,haterd should be on That list

18300,well they kinda have a point with gta.  A LITTLE MIND YOU !!
18301,"The only people who actually give a shit what video games their kids play are suburban soccer mums who probably make their kids go to bed at 7:30 and probably consider the word ""hell"" a swear word lol,  its a fucking game, you finish it then you forget about it and move on to the next one, their are pedophiles that are walking free on the streets but somehow there are pussies more worried about their child shooting a computer generated character in a fucking video game"
18302,who cares its video games we have bigger problems causing violence like child abuse movies and so many other shit like bruh
18303,"american open mind? Jesus, what a bunch a idiots over there trying to tell what we think about games. you heard me, we talk about games... not real life!"
18304,"Why is everyone blaming videogames for everything. Iam addicted to minecraft and iam not runnning into forests to punch trees.
Oh yes to that with Felluja. In WW2 many people lost their life and its not controverse?
How....i realy mean how?"
18305,All the people that complained about video games in these scenes are failed abortions.
18306,what video game caused number one? or was it just video games in general
18307,"Why Pokemon is controversy? Pokemon is one of the games that teach us how to treat and train our pets. Other than Lavender Town, no one should dislike Pokemon."
18308,"Just one word: PUSSIES. P.D: ?What are parents for then? Yet i see kids between 6 and 12 years old playing things like Mortal Kombat, Grand Theft Auto, God of War and Call of Duty."
18309,so instead blaming on way to liberal law on guns they blame it on video games
18310,"They don't want you to play video games 
-DJ Khaled"
18311,"They just want a scapegoat, something easy to blame and point at. When people have to understand it is mental health that we need to focus on. But that would require funding and time."
18312,"Witchcraft   ,satanic, all this types of   garbage   are thrown at  games  just because  the lack of education? because  there are people  who did something wrong and at one point they played a game  and suddenly it is the game fault  ? because it is easy to  blame  something without life    in order not to upset anybody? Oh , my child is depressed   etc.  OH MY  GOD THESE VIDEO GAMES not  my lack of  brain to help him or understand him  . Television and  politicians(which i don't know why their  word is important)  these  2  are  more  fucked  than all pornographic industry(at least  they create something  useful)  . I bet there are  here   people who played   games  most of their lives  , all genres  and I bet most of them are not  the next  Luis Garavito ,in fact I bet they are more intelligent  than most of these TV  clowns  .  I know I am late  but I am new to this channel and  I cannot  stand this  ,good day to all ."
18313,It was just Americans getting offended over everything. Still do today.
18314,"How more stupid can people be. I mean people die literally everyday and they are going to get out of their way just because of some video game, wow humanity really is stupid."
18315,Why wont anyone think of the innocent pixels!?
18316,Just ban the guns and the massacres won't happen. Then violent 'gamers' will have to pay for weapons on the black market which can be very expensive
18317,"Free Live Sex Cam Show, Exclusive Unlimited Access:      BabeGirlsHere.BlogSpot------------------c0m"
18318,"I play plenty of video games mostly ""violent"" such as gta and cod but I've never thought of actually shooting someone irl ppl are pre destined to do so they were planning on shooting someone before that or they are just fucking crazy and tried to copy a scene from a game BC they are insane."
18319,"Never ceases to amaze me how insane many of religious people are, and how many still believes in those storyes in north america. Wouldnt be suprised if they would start to drown women in US for witchcraft again. Well maybe they alter theyr religion again and instead of killing cos of witchcraft they start to kill ppl who play pokemon cos its some how in theyr insane minds ""satanic"".
Just seems so absurd from outsiders point of view how many ppl and how much religion still has power in usa. Ofc there are other countrys in the world where religion still has great influens. But considering that they probaly think that us is one of the more civilized countries in the world but still they have even in tv lot of religious shows and religion has heavy impact in many things. And they talk in tv how something is wrong and ""demonic"" purely cos of some religion. Thats just so funny in so many levels.
And also how ppl like to blame mass killings on games. Why they dont ban religions after all many people through out the history have killed becose of some religious reason. Like back in the day when christians had they insane crusades and now  ISIS is doing the same thing and many single ppl who have killed cos they felt religiously justified."
18320,"Hyped game of 2009? Then what am i supposed to call The 2009 Game Of The Year, Uncharted 2?"
18321,they are games they aren't real the government doesn't know wtf they are talking about go complain about something else that actually makes sense like hacking other people
18322,what pisses me off is that people say video games are too real if anything games like GTA and cod are a good thing that keeps violent people from murder and shit like that by giving them the ability to do so in a virtual world I mean its called a video game for a reason
18323,"I've been playing violent video games since I was 6 yo (26 today)
I play them as entertainment....
Stop blaming media on crimes like VG! You are too fucking stupid!"
18324,"I believe games can't be blamed for actions, and the game isn't what decides what the person will do. The person does, just like the weapon that is used in shootings doesn't cause the shooting, but the person causes the shooting. Also for those of you who say banning guns will solve the problem, they won't solve anything. Just look at Paris, which has banned guns everywhere, the weapons are banned, but that didn't stop terrorists from getting their hands on fully automatic assault rifles, and killing 120 people."
18325,"""...the most realistic sex acts ever conceived"" 
I hope the man who wrote that realised that he just made a brilliant pun."

18331,dear people who get offended by nothing: GROW A PAIR
18332,Um i say the last one is more left then right thank you.
18333,"5:29 LOL, wtf was that xD"
18334,"I remember playing ""No Russian"" on MW2. As Makarov talked in the elevator, I thought ""Why am I with him?"" When I got out and saw all those people, I had no idea what was about to happen. They just started shooting everyone, and I just sat there with my mouth wide open. I was pretty upset about it, even though the game was built on violence. Same thing with the torture scene in GTA5. There was no reason for it. Especially when you have to drive him to the airport, and he is crying, saying he wants to see his family and hug his children."
18335,all of those controversy are so dumb
18336,Then parents should quite bitching cause their 11 year old son is playing a game thats 18+ game
18337,"When your law system is faulted and lets people by weapons and your health system is to expensive to help those who need it which can cause those to kill because of mental illness but you don't want to tale the t

18338,ok but those top ones for sure should not have been made.
18339,Has anyone else noticed that Fox news was the news source in most of these? I can't believe people still think it is refutable.

18360,Have the reporters even stopped to think for a second that maybe nobody gives a single atom of fuck about their opinions? No? Yeah I didn't think so either...
18361,I think it's so stupid how video games get blamed for stuff. When all the same stuff happens in movies / music...

18366,"You know, instead of banning such games from countries, why not tell or teach the kids especially the ones who have some certain mental disorders to not do the things the characters do in the game. Sure it can be common sense to the majority of players but what about players with distinct mental disorders? People who doesn't know better? just educate them and it'll prevent a lot more disasters and ridiculous controversies such as these."
18367,"And things like this, folks, is why we can't EVER have nice things."

18372,"Poor Pokemon. Its just a friendly, cute strategy game..."

18397,"Does the government play video games? I thought they were just a bunch of old white guys talking about how they hate women? Also Tomb Raider (2013), where people lost their shit after the ""rape"" scene?"

18400,"People should not blame video games for being the reason mass shootings happen. the reality of it is the person itself, and what environment they grew up in I play video games all the time but I'm not going to shoot up an airport. It's all about how the kid was raised and what kind of environment he grew up in."
18401,"So I guess it's weird that ""No Russian"" was my favorite mission to play back 6 years ago. I simply thought it was pretty badass how they just walked in like that. Just the concept of it. But that was 6 six years ago and massacres like that in real life are not badass, they're really just stupid. I liked the mission for what it was and how it developed the story of the game and nothing more. And I was 10-11 then and still think it's a pretty cool mission because of various reasons. I'm sure I'm not the only one"
18402,If they ban video games they have to ban movies since they show much more violence
18403,Do people not have comen since? Why blame a video game or how about we just blame the whole gaming community? For all the bad things on the world?... NO! HOW ABOUT WE BLAME THE PEOPLE WHO DO THESE HANAS CRIMES!!!!! WELL?!

18405,here is an idea stop blaming video games and start blaming these idiot parents
18406,It's laughable that America will blame their mass shootings on videos games as opposed to the ease of access its citizens have to firearms. I don't how many more shootings they're waiting for to happen before it gets through their thick skulls.
18407,Trust the USA to blame games instead of guns for people getting shot.

A kid wants to kill his neighbors, but instead he chose to play GTA V

A man wants to run on public with a dildo in his hand punching people in the face, but instead he chose to play Saints Row
A guy wants to be an unqualified doctor and kills his patients, instead he chose to play Surgery Simulation
A goat wants to blow up a gas station, but instead it chose to play Goat Simulation
Video games can really save lives, just think about it, just, think about it."
18421,"What causes mass shootings? The evilness in that person heart. It's not video games, it's not the guns, it's not tv, movies, or music. It's the evil person that's doing the killing. The evilness that lies in that persons heart is what is causing these mass shootings."

18435,I hate when people blame violent acts on video games. Like um no? That person decided to do that or that had a disorder. Video games don't lead to violent behavior. I'll be overjoyed to see the day when my generation that has grown up with video games become politicians and talk show hosts because they won't blame video games
18436,"Yet again, more proof that humanity condemns that which it does not understand. Something new comes into the picture, and all of the sudden it's the root of all humanity's problems. Violent video games? Must be the reason why a murderer shot up a movie theater."

6. Conservative country with video games; all thanks to former South Australia attorney-general Michael Atkinson who bans the adult rating for video game
5. GTA controversy (In Thailand at least).
4. Upset war activist over the war video game

18445,"I'm no stranger to video game violence, but even I would say Manhunt 2 makes me cringe. It's too damn realistic. Games like Mortal Kombat or Doom, or their JRPG variant, Shadow Hearts, are harmless because they're impossible in real life. You can't smash somebody's skull, but you can do just about everything in Manhunt 2."

18449,"I think it comes down to 1 simple thing. Games have age ratings on the box and have done for more than 20 years. If your kid is playing an 18 plus game that's YOUR fault. I'm 46, have two teenage boys and I check every game they have in the house. I'm not completely inflexible but I believe it's my responsibility as a parent to know what my children play and what they watch. I don't think a video game can make someone into a killer/rapist/drug dealer etc the way the media and certain political and religious figures claim but I do think a child should not be exposed to things that are inappropriate for their age. I also have a parental control on their phones, laptops and other gadgets because they need to be there to protect them. I just feel it's my job to be aware of what my children are watching and playing. Anyone blaming the industry because 'my son/daughter was exposed to sex/violence/drugs etc' is ducking their own responsibility."

God damn.."

18459,"thats why you dont let idiots like that to review the game, those people really.. idiotic"
18460,emm........first?lol
18461,Do they forget that there are many Mass Effect characters that are women who play key roles in the storyline of the entire series?  And the sex scenes in the first game are more boring than playing Kanasta with your great aunt Bessie.
18462,"4 words 
IT'S A FUCKING GAME"
18463,"I believe that ""violent video games"" can help people let off steam and get too much hate"
18464,"I'm surprised no mention the controversy over the character designs of the Elf, the Amazon, and the Sorceress in Dragon's Crown."
18465,noticed how fox news is the only one who is all over everything
18466,you get to be a terrorist and kill people and its VERY realistic
18467,"I'm a little bit divided on the issue myself.  On one note, I agree that video games aren't responsible for every evil that exists in our modern times.  On the other hand, I don't agree with the logic of ""They're just mentally ill"".  I love video games, maybe not some of the more violent video games (Was never really my thing, although I do enjoy the mythology and story of Mortal Kombat), but I won't exclude the fact that some of the video games on this list might have inspired some chaotic actions in the minds of chaotic individuals.  
I was going to write a long and complicated explanation, but I think I'll just make it simple instead.  I guess I could just say, ""Video games don't kill people, people kill people"".  I could also say that everyone is different, and will be affected by something in a way that is contrary to something else (Like finding the secrets of the universe on the back of a bubblegum wrapper I guess, thanks Gene Hackman).  Me personally, I find it concerning that games in the Grand Theft Auto franchise actually use realistic criminal acts within their game play, as I was always the kind of guy who liked to play as a hero and stop such things from happening (One of my favorite parts of a cop show is seeing one of these guys be put behind bars).  That whole thing about playing as a terrorist definitely concerned me (I'm not as familiar with the Call of Duty games, I'm more a fan of a lot of Nintendo fare, or other classics.  They just seemed to interest me more).  
That said, I won't blame GTA or Call of Duty or any video game on a crime unless there's undeniable proof.  I know that the creators of the games certainly don't want to inspire such things to happen, much like comic writers of EC Comics didn't really intend for the stories within their horror titles to inspire similar behavior in such youth.  They are all creative individuals who just wanna have fun, I can't believe anything else (Save for money I guess, but whatever).  I will never honestly believe video games like GTA or others of its ilk are instructions on how to be a serial killer, that's just stupid.  However, I do think there needs to be a little bit of responsibility.  The ESRB rating system seems to have worked for its 20 plus years of existence (At least I think it's been around that long...yeah, okay, it has.  My sister was born in 95, and she's actually 20 now, going on 21.  Man I feel old, not to mention nostalgic).  In reality I don't have all the answers, that's obvious, no mortal human being does.  I hope these three paragraphs didn't make anyone angry, as I was...well, trying to get a handle on all this myself.
ONE LAST THING:  Those things they were saying about Pokemon is just stupid.  Not only were those televangelists way off base (Or maybe in their defense, as they don't really play the games, they could get all kinds of weird ideas about them).  As a Christian myself, I don't really see anything satanic unless you make it that way in your own head, it's merely a fun game that I'm actually still a fan of (Guilty, I own maybe...okay, I'm a nerd, moving on).  And that peta crap...yeah, when I first heard about it, it really made me hate peta!!!"
18468,3:47
18469,"Their fucking games!! not real, people need to calm the fuck down, I play Pokemon, its not violent, its a cute RPG, where you can raise cute little animals."
18470,"The pokemon thing, I could definitely see people thinking that way about it. I mean, you're a 10 year old who forces animals to fight other animals to catch them and make those animals fight other animals. I saw a funny parody on it by Dorkly, I think it was. Some guy gave a kid a gun instead of a pokemon and Prof. Oak was like ""what the hell""?? And the other Prof. basically said ""it's better then giving him a wild animal to control and teach him to fight other animals with"". He also made a remake about one of them basically being Satan (Garitina). Which I could see. I mean, you do get the god of all pokemon (Arceus). Don't get me wrong, I LOVE pokemon. I currently own Platinum and Soul Silver. Also, Black 1 and 2. Currently working on Soul silver. So don't take this as me saying Pokemon is bad. I'm just saying that I could see how someone would this the game is a bit Satanic.."
18471,Why is the american meia not blaming the fact that america has ridiculous gun laws rather than blaming video games
18472,"it's a common occurrence, when a tragedy happens like a mass shooting; what ever the perpetrator liked is to blame. for instance; marilyn manson and the columbine massacre and heath ledger's portrayal of the joker with the dark knight rises premier shooting.
people don't want to admit that their negligence and/ or ignorance caused the event to happen (columbine; parents didn't bother to see if their kids were being bullied, teachers were blind to popular kids actions due to natural bias) and so if they liked something that had blood or a guitar solo; it's immediately to blame.
also; i doubt you'd get fox news blaming mozart or bach if a mad man listened to them (i know he's fictonal but; hannibal lectre anyone?!). this is just my view and i'd appreciate it if you didn't torch me for simply posting my opinion on this"
18473,"Aaaannnnddd why do people fuss over video games? It's not like it is real, and the players know that it's not real...right?"
18474,people are so fucking sensitive now a days
18475,"It annoys me so tremendously when people claim completely incorrect things about video games, like the infamous Mass Effect controversy. I can at least understand things like the Six Days in Fallujah controversy (regardless of my own opinion); emulating a recent battle where real civilians and soldiers lost their lives can seem insensitive, as can the Russian airport stage. They aren't going to cause anyone to go on a bloody rampage, obviously, but empathy and not wanting to cause each other distress is the basis of what makes us human, so it's good to have a discussion about things like Six Days In Fallujah. Instead, what we get is a moral panic after moral panic about how games are ruining our kids, all littered with lies. People who don't understand games in the slightest lecture ADULTS about the supposedly child-raping video games they're playing. When they're told these games are M-rated, they still press on about how kids can play them anyway so it doesn't matter. Why does no one ever say the same thing about movies? ""Let's ban action movies, a kid somewhere might watch it!"" Wouldn't go over so well."
18476,"All of these all lies, Columbine shooters were motivated by Doom. 100% legit 'cause I asked them in prison."
18477,"video games doesn't make people violence...
lag does..."
18478,"Some video games, especially from Rockstar Games, have been banned in other countries. For example, Bully is banned in Australia. If they checked out the game throughly, they'd know that in the game you don't even play as a bully, you're against them. For goodness sakes man. 
When it comes to movies, ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""American Psycho"", ""The Godfather"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", etc., are all considered to be classics. When it comes to video games, ""Grand Theft Auto,"" ""Bully"", ""Manhunt"", ""Halo"", etc., are all ""bad"", and ""should be banned."" What the heck.
Violence, crude/mature humor, language and heavy subject matters have been in entertainment for years, and that includes video games. It's time for the modern media to get used to it and let people use their freedom of entertainment. Most people know fiction from reality. Few people will not. This has been a fact of life even before gaming culture. :(
And it's really sad."
18479,"Well to be fair pokemon I think was originally supposed to be an anime not for kids, so the game would follow the anime's example."

Imagine the game on a ps3 or ps4? it sounds fun, and could be a decent call of duty type game."

18554,"The funny thing about the whole ""video games turns people into mass murderers"" is that there are movies and TV shows that children and young teens can also get easy access to. Dexter for example, Breaking Bad, hell even in Taken where Liam Neeson tortured a man in a home made electric chair to death because that man is associated with the organization that took his daughter. Why blame it on one media and not the other? Parents should be the real blame for their kid(s) psychotic disorder."
18555,Fox news never disapoints. Really Fox?
18556,Turkey fuckers banning minecraft
18557,"Oh my god, I watch mortal kombat x fatalities and I do not cringe and am immune to it but for some reason I felt sick to my stomach at 5:53 because I could imagine it being so real.."
18558,was anyone else trying to figure that what game was # 1 cuse i still dont what game they put  as # 1
18559,"reporters and politicians are shit, they don't know anything about real life and the video game industry. I don't even want to develop, it's just so annoying to see those stupid dumbasses saying crap."
18560,lesson learned folks. news is retarded
18561,"In case you didn't know, video games are played as well in Europe, Asia, here in Latin America and other regions around the world; and still United States is the country with more mass shootings. Do your conclusions"
18562,Parents who blame bad things they're children do on video games are just to stupid or ashamed to take responsability and teach they're child right from wrong.
18563,parents can choose whether or not their children can play certain games
18564,Violence video games rule.
18565,Fox News needs to go away.
18566,I can't believe they cancelled 6 days at fulujah it's just a game why cant people see that
18567,"No one really believes that Pokemon is Satanic, racist, or encourages animal abuse. It's just so stupid and annoying that parents will say anything to try to get it taken off the market because they can't stand it anymore! I'm a teacher and at my school, the kids even have a rock, paper, scissors type of game called Pikachu. It goes ""Pika up pika down pika upside down Piiiiiikkaaaaaaaachuuuuuu!"" and they raise either one, two, or no fingers against each other. If it wasn't a constant thing, I wouldn't care, but when one does it, it seems the rest do it,too. At least they have the attention span of gnats when it comes to games, and its usually only popular for a week at a time, before they come up with something else. But for about one week a month, I want to kill that little yellow bastard."
18568,Ok I am 12 and I seen to get this more than the press I love cod and battlefield etc. But wake up you did this with rock and roll back when it was made and now it's video games. The fact is if your a parent and your child is mentally ill YOU DONT LET THEM PLAY THE GAME! But then there's the press who don't seen to get that there are people who have WORKED FOR TEN YEARS ON THIS! And said no video games don't cause real world violence. Real world psychopaths do. Ahhh i don't know why don't people get it. You know it's bad when a 12 year-old gets but 30 year-olds don't get it.
18569,"Studies have shown that people that are raised in religious homes have a harder time telling fantasy from reality. When you're told that demons are real, people can live in whales, or that all the animals can fit on a boat and survive in a serious tone, how will you be able to recognize other things that are false?
It is because of this that we see xians attacking things like D&D, video games, music, and thinking that these things are making kids do things because the xians complaining cannot THEMSELVES understand that these things aren't real."
18570,lol Its just a ''Game'' fucking pussys
18571,The portal 2 thing was ridiculous
18572,"oh wow, no wonder we (australia) have people like abott"

18576,"Blaming a terrorist act in a video game for large acts of violence is like me saying ""Michelangelo made a pornographic statue that promotes rape.""
Maturity is knowing that video games are FICTION and NOT REAL. The dumb cunt at 4:58 clearly doesn't understand the difference between what is real and what is not. It's people like these who raise terrorists and serial killers."
18577,your channel is called eagle bricks because you're a fan of the Philadelphia eagles.

18579,Goddamn this was boring
18580,"how do video games cause violence? what games inspired Hitler, Attila and Genghis?"
18581,That mabinogi case that happened.
18582,"As much as I think Fox News is as neutral as possible, they were just ridiculous in this video..."
18583,There a interesting thought before game and movie back in parts of history there was places in time where mass murder or even genocide of a town or placewas happening from single or multiple people. And we honor them in history book or biography.
18584,"Im from australia and can buy left 4 dead 2, saints row 4 and state of decay so i dont know what drugs these guys are on .."
18585,"USA, don't blame video games for massacres, blame your shitty gun laws."
18586,Everything on this video is BULL SHIT!!! Any video game controversy is BULL SHIT!!!
18587,The blame game is a game blame.
18588,"sure games are bad but, cigarettes are fine!"
18589,"The Boondocks said it the best: if a mass shooting occurs, and you're faced with the blame game, who do you attack? A nerdy, skinny weakling who's never been a fight in his life who makes video games for a living, or a smart man who has access to a warehouse and numerous guns? It's pretty simple: blame the video games"
18590,Don't know why there bitching about video games being the cause for shootings haven't they ever thought that its probably they are mental fuck wads. As well to the media news reporters and idiots like that mental fuck wads bet they play or have little kids that play C.O.D as well.
18591,If there are more voices in there head then buttons on the controller then they don't get to play the damn game.
18592,"Year 2020: What!? We can't play violent video games anymore? Okay, I'll go look for my violence in all the Movies, TV shows, and books that the media apparently supports."
18593,"It's Fox News, what do you expect? Lol.
They're all nothing but conservative douchebags who blame ""new fangled games"" because their conservative brains don't understand the concept of the 21st century."
18594,"Because Fox and CNN are reliable ""news"" agencies."
18595,Fuck it! I'm going to Britain!
18596,having 4 adults debating video game violence for a country of zombies at the edge of their seat is proof of very real widespread mental illness that the last clip described.
18597,I bet MW2 is gonna be in here for that airport massacre that I can't remember
18598,"I'm sick of this whole debate about videogames. Get over it. People just need something to constantly bitch about. If people don't like them then go the fuck elsewhere. Like the game that was supposedly satanic. Just shut the fuck up and get over it. Or pokemon. It's a fun games for anyone and they are gonna sit there and say it's teaching kids to be abusive. Noooooo it's something to allow people to relax and have fun, but no that's to difficult for some people."
18599,"Ahh... Fox News. They just love ruining lives. I mean seriously, movies, books, hell- even the news itself is more/are as gruesome and explicit as videogames, yet are barely tried against. I guess everyone hates fun."
18600,Don't blame the parents for not be good parents. Blame the game... yeah that makes sense
18601,SOME people lost their children in that battle' so don't make a game about it but Call of Duty can make games with missions involving WW2 battles like Battle of Stalingrad where around 1 million people lost children.
18602,Its always fox news. They really have nothing better to do.
18603,The lady in the last clip had it right
18604,"Fucking conservatives all burn in your self imagined hell... You do not change, you do not adapt, so your whole kin is soon to die out you everything hating scum. Now hate on my comment all you want, hating is the only thing you know after all."
18605,"i can understand people playing video games wanting to try a shootout in real life.... i mean, afterall, i jump on every turtle i see."
18606,"my son didn't have that choice.... uh, pretty sure not signing up for the army is a choice."
18607,Video 1 : Well wemon can make video games too problem is no one buys em lol!
18608,"I feel people just blame video games for making people do bad thing because they think that humans are too good to do things like that without an inspiration. And scents there are games that have shooting and killing in it they just say ""oh ya lits blame that because it got killing in it."" Games are only bad if u make them bad and people that do do bad things because they saw it in a video game and thought it was fun are already mental and stupid."
18609,"#1 Pisses Me Off, Because When Ever Stuff Like Teenagers Doing Massacres In Schools Or Something Like That Happens, Videos Games Are The First Things People Blame, But Can We Not Admit That We Always See This Stuff On T.V On Shows Or Even Movies, But No One Ever Says Anything About That. Its Always The Video Games."
18610,"Another EXTREMELY controversial game is the beloved Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. It had lots of religious and racial offenses, such as the original music of the Fire Temple, and the design of the Skull Kid(s). Being a Zelda fan myself, I still play LoZ: OoT all the time!"
18611,"Also the scientific studies show that playing video games (even violent ones) for about 2 hours a day can take your mid off of like a bad day at school. But another study shows that over use like, 6 hours at a time results in very violent and aggressive behavior. Like most things, play them in moderation. But...sex scenes? Over fake unreal people generated by engines? NO excuse."
18612,What about CS:GO!!!
18613,THERE SHOULDNT BE SEX IN VIDEO GAMES!!!!!! PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!! THERE PIXELATED BEINGS OF NOTHING!!!!!!
18614,Minecraft being banned in a country for violence
18615,Ok I understand the terrorist mission and some others but just because a game has a gun in it doesn't mean it's gonna mean someone's gonna go shoot everyone
18616,Saying that videogames cause violence is like a kid finding his dad's Playboy magazines and the dad blaming Playboy...
18617,"Ahh, it all makes sense now. Games you play on tv are what leads to mass shootings. Definitely not the fact that Americas gun laws are so warped."
18618,"its surprising how many channels choose stupidity to get attention in the news.
really, lots of video games aren't even that violent!"
18619,Yay! YOGSCAST Kim!
18620,they just need to grow up
18621,fox news sucks
18622,"How long will this stupidity will end? I've been waiting for 17 years already,If this continues I'm afraid I'll be a misanthrope."
18623,"#9 ""Pokemon world is a world to the demonic"" Must people be paranoid and stupid? because that guy obviously has no idea on what he's talking about. This is were LOGIC comes in, If the Pokemon world really is a ""door way"" to a ""demonic world"", then wouldn't the game already be discontinued and recalled? besides, i love playing pokemon"
18624,What I get super confused about is how people get offended by games depicting war. What do you think actually happens? War is inherently an act of terrorism so why get offended when people expose the actual horrors of it?
18625,wow these guys a incredibly bias towards fox news way to not mention that every other news station also has stories about how video games lead to violence. Not to mention how bias they are towards conservatives and Christians these guys are totally bias.
18626,I guess Vlad the Impaler played a torture simulator video game which made him a cruel man that killed and tortured thousands. Makes sense.
18627,I never played Manhunt. Is it any good? It looks amazing
18628,are there any free downloads for 6 days in fallujah?
18629,Video games don't kill people people that don't know the true value of life kill people with exceptions of course
18630,No postal 2?
18631,What's #1?
18632,It always pisses me off when people blame video games for causing violence most people are freaking smart enough to know that things in video aren't OK to do in real life and don't just go around shooting people. Those that don't should learn some fucking common sense
18633,"News on no Russian : this makes you a terrorist
Me on no Russian : dang it I died again"
18634,Its funny that nobody blames de Bible (a book that has lots and lots of violence) when it comes to violent actions.
18635,"so I have $500, either spend it all on a console with some violentvideo gamesor I can buy a gun. take away the violent video games your leaving me with justa gun. smart move."
18636,Now fucking get ur head straight I mean kids have killed people because they've play a violent game cough cough* also because there fucked up*cough*cough* but eighteen year olds and higher aren't dumb! So theres not way In the world that parents or eighteens year olds have shot people because of games
18637,Don't hate games hate the idiots who try to copy the actions to the games
18638,"A mass murderer plays lots of videogames? Oh my, it must've made him violent.
Do these fuckwits not realise that 99 percent of youths play the shit out of videogames everyday? If videogames really were linked to violence then we'd be living in a state of anarchy and marshal law."
18639,God I hate hillary if she or trump gets in our  country is fucked
18640,KIIIIIIIIIIIMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18641,Am I the only conservative watching this video?
18642,"liberals and conservatives alike bitch about video games. both parties want the same thing but present their ideas through a different lens. it's not a party issue, a lot of things people go straight to calling a ""party issue"" really have little to do with tribal politics. they have more to do with the vast majority of people not realizing that correlation != causation. it's people's generally flawed understanding of cause and effect chains coupled with their reluctance to inwardly reflect, to see what role(s) they play in the construction and perpetuation of societal norms, and to take responsibility for their own actions. (mostly because it's easier and requires a lot less honest thought to blame someone else, especially when the target is an easy an widely accessible one)"
18643,"You really had to censor that clothes-on sex movements scene didn't you, Watchmojo? XD
Also, its always FOX news shitting on video games with BS assumptions to attract masses. And in the early days of games you always had those people who could speak well for a crowd, but lacked sense."
18644,I haven't watched yet bum in expecting GTA to make some kind of appearance and no Russian will be on here
18645,Why are people so sensitive to violent video games? If you don't like them dont play them!
18646,Fox news reporters are fucking idiots and douchebags.
18647,The thing that really annoys me is that there are movies with much more gore and sexual activity and people don't seem to care about those.
18648,what happened to god of war? haha I was waiting on it
18649,"Just to start off massive killings happend before videogames,internet n tv was ever made
:P"
18650,Hmm I'm noticing that a certain network is usually involved...
18651,Fc3 citra ending???
18652,"So only video games make people violent? What about movies,music, or even books. It's stupid when people only blame entertainment on things like that, when the person is probably I'll in the head, but that's the world I guess."
18653,"Music at 7.38? please if someone know this, please respond :3"
18654,Aaand I guess in Australia torrenting must be something akin to a national sport :D
18655,"Lol 95% of the news sources was fox, games are rated mature for a reason, only an adult should be playing call of duty, GTA, and saints row. For the majority of Americans (99.99%) these games have no effect and are just entertainment. But the other .01% that have mental issues this can trigger or cause big mental issues"
18656,Do people notice that THIS IS ALL CODE i mean in like gta you are code shooting at other code and if you don't want your kid to buy this game because it has adult humor or something like that then don't buy it for them or not let them buy it.
18657,"I don't see why all those people blame shootings among other things on video games. There are millions of people worldwide that play video games, and if video games really did have a psychological effect on people as some claim they do, I'm guessing there would be way more shootings than there actually are. Also many seem to forget that worse things than the columbine high school shooting occurred long before video games even existed. It seems like the first thing that comes along that people don't like all of society's problems are blamed on it. All you dumbasses that give video games a bad rep need to start looking at actual facts instead of blaming a bunch of problems on something just because you don't like it. Sure video games can cause eye damage but other than that they're harmless enough. You'd have to be pretty sick in the head to want to go shoot up a place just because it was in a video game and most people that would be sick enough to do such things are already locked up somewhere. Just because a few morons did bad things due to video games it doesn't mean all of society has to be punished."
18658,"They should do another vid about the same topic, and add hatred."
18659,"The dumbasses mixing satanic shit into this are fucking retards, you can believe your little fairytale world at home, but dont mix your fantasy religion stuff into the real world"
18660,"Christ people are soooo fucking whiny, ""OH MY SON DIDN'T GET A SECOND CHANCE!"" Oh, fucking, well. It's completely irrelevant, this is a fucking, video game!"
18661,This video will attract fox haters like moths to a candle. Good work.
18662,Just shut the fuck up fox news.
18663,"A lot of these are HORRIFYING. I also remember watching my friend's cousin play GTA San Andreas years ago, I think when it first came out..."
18664,"Haha, old people in the news are so clueless."
18665,Anyone within the right mind will think that a game is just a game and that it isn't real.
18666,"games are not the only reason why there are shootings, music plays a role too, but the role of music giving people adrenaline and feeling power and putting it into actions. the best example i can put out on something like this, is Columbine.
They say the shooters of columbine '99 had multiple motives but the main ones that stick out were games and music. Harris and Klebold listened to Rammstein, KMFDM but mainly listened to Marilyn Manson and they also played Doom and Duke Nukem.
But yea, as a Rammstein and KMFDM fan myself, i do feel power in their music, but not like power these guys took in."
18667,"moral of the story, some assholes can't tell the difference between a video game and reality, throw a fit, and everybody else has to suffer"
18668,"This is why they have the rates, if it MA 15+ or R, the parent should not even consider to accept game into their homes, it is simple as that.Thank you parent for fucking up my time in game."
18669,"It's such a shame people blame video games instead of the human who commuted the act. At one point in our lives, we've all played a FPS. But does that mean we're going to go to a school with an assault rifle? No."
18670,"for once i want a reporter to say that there just games, games dont make people go out buy a gun and shot people people just dont like to believe that some people are just assholes"
18671,I think you should've included Postal2...
18672,"Why cant the news mind their own motherfucking BUSINESS!!!!!! I'm fucking sick and tired of them making controversies and halting video game developments. They can go to hell!! Why do you think the ESRB eatings are on video game cases. If its rated m for mature, then adults should buy it for themselves, not their underaged children! Use your mind people! Also, I've played many extremely violent video games and I am underaged, but am I encouraged to kill people??? NO!!!!! Video games dont make people kill each other. Damn, motherfucking dumbasses!"
18673,How is Pokemon controversial
18674,Where is Portal 2?
18675,"#4 is stupid, like really all these war games that have came out and this one is the one that actually gets crap"
18676,"Wow, so much Fox News and their spreading of garbage.
""You know people did die in that battle, right?""
Oh, so Pearl Harbor should have had its funding cut too? What about Saving Private Ryan? No, those get to be celebrated? Huh, funny how that works."
18677,"Biggest Controversy: Video games make people violent. We all know that is F**ING bull***, a PAIN in my @$$,and I swear to god, I will mutilate the next ten dozen people who say otherwise to prove my point!!!"
18678,MW2 can be terrioust.   Counter Strike can also be terrioust -_-
18679,australia has those games now i have saints row 4 myself
18680,I find it funny that video games are always to blame. Besides video games aren't what make people violent.
18681,I get why Australia would ban saint row but state of decay
18682,"Wasnt the AC-130 mission in COD 4 considerd, ""to real""?"
18683,Did you know that a murderer ate a sandwich before murdering someone? OMG SANDWICHES MAKE US VIOLENT OMG
18684,"I know this is all opinion based, so I'm tossing out my opinion. 
Rapelay should have been in here. It's a game where all you do is stalk some women, rape them, and make them your sex slaves. 
Worse than Pokemon, but that's just my opinion."
18685,"You know what also spurred controversy?
Hatred."
18686,"If murder is caused by video games, then why have people been doing it since biblical times, last i checked they didnt have video games back then, just sayin"
18687,"I have every single game legally that according to this video was ""banned"". So that's bogus. (in reference to the Australia ban)."
18688,"I still find it a bit odd that Rapelay didn't make this list, even as an honourable mention."
18689,i say when people are making a News channel they should get me to do it lol i have a lot of good opinions that i could share and im just a normal person
18690,"Idiots in the news. They always blame video games for every shooting. Only the sickest people would commence a shooting. Taking away video games will do more bad then good. Because the people who plays shooters would miss the games pleasure, and would kill real innocent people for pleasure. WAKE UP AMERICA!"
18691,"OH-MY-FREAKING-GOD! I'm so sick of this! My bro played the GTA series for years and he never took a car out to run people over for points!
Me? I'm a Pokefan fierce and true! But that doesn't mean I'm gonna put food dye on my pets to make them look like Pikachu or Archen! 
Mr Preacher Guy? I've been playing Pokemon games since my childhood and intend to continue to do so, but I am NOT a Satanist! I avoid ouija boards and the like cos I know messing with that stuff is NEVER a good idea! So your argument is a load of Tauros manure!
Parents? This may shock you: video games are NOT to blame for every time one of your little darlings decides to storm his/her school with a loaded arsenal! Remember that one girl who 'did not Mondays'? Video games innocent of all wrongdoing there in fact it was her own father who bought her the damned gun! Pick any horrible school shooting and I'll bet there were more factors than just 'oh they played GTA that must have been the reason'!
And isn't 18 legally an adult in most parts of the world? No one under 18 should play a 16+ game! I'll admit I did when I was under 18 but I'm not about to lay waste to the world from the back of a fire breathing Dragon!
In short I'll say this: Sometimes bad kids do terrible things, especially when they're able to get their hands on weapons meant for only highly trained adults! Have some responsibility and take off the rose-tinted spectacles already!
(I haven't forgotten about you either PETA! I never stuck a needle in my Snivy's head or shaved my Oshawott's butt! I used to respect you but not so much anymore :p )"
18692,Pokemon teaches kids how to cast spels? THATS HARRY F**** POTTER! NOT POKEMON
18693,Media gonna love Hatred
18694,FUCK YOU PEOPLE DONT BAN OUR GAMES
18695,"Shit I now know why Adam Lanza killed 26 people in a school shooting, it's not that he had mental issues and knew how to shoot, video games told him to!"
18696,Mortal Kombat 3 Forever!
18697,It's up to the parents to keep these things out of the hands of children.
18698,Bernie Sanders 2016
18699,that black woman understood why theese massive shooting happen. it because a person who has mental illnes should not play video games
18700,"I never understood why violence is considered ""more okay"" in USA than sex or profanity. In many cases it is okay to show somones head being ripped off but don't you dare say f*ck on tv or show a nipple."
18701,"All these people would shit their conservative asses off if they knew what Shin Megami Tensei is about.
Just saying. Not trying to offend anyone. Just giving my opinion."
18702,#6 isn't true. The government probably wanted those games to be banned but none of them actually were. I'm an Aussie and my a bunch of my friends own and pre-ordered the witches 2 and saints row 4.
18703,It looks like media TOTALLY forgots about strategic games . . .
18704,"How about number #0 on the top 10 list:

18705,Our ancestors would massacre these pansies.
18706,Ever heard of parenting your kids yeah me neither.
18707,"Out of these only #4 and (part of) #9 are complains with actual truthfulness. Gambling in Pokmon is always addictive, specially since some Pokmon and items are only available at high prices in slot machines, and Six Days in Fallujah was indeed insensitive towards the people who survived and were scarred for life. The rest is pure sensationalism."
18708,Screw FOX news.
18709,"Have you noticed how its mainly Americans complaining about this kind of shit, they think games are violent,they spend more time making their streets safer rather than pissing off game developers"
18710,"rule of rose was banned thier too because its tailer and its banned in engaled but waht they were complaing about was not in the game.
its kinda lord of files but with grils . the main gril was trying to sort out her momery and there cules to what happen in her momeorys. if not kill the guy and give him the gun you will get the true end and check out the books you get plus if serach the house there clues there too but have to go into every rom and look everywere"
18711,Good God Congress needs to focus on more important things.
18712,gta san andreas sex scene was not part of the actuall game and wasnt ment to be in the game.
18713,"i hate when EVERYONE blames real violence on videogames, they just dont like videogames and want to find a reason that seems plausable so they can be banned, what about other motives, only true retards become criminals due to videogames, how about mental illnesses, or legalization of guns and drugs, THOSE are dangerous, videogames arent(unless your retarted, because im young and i can see not to be violent because of games, if adults are so much smarter then how come they are so much more retarted)"

18716,"I don't understand what is the big deal about CoD, yea you murder a lot of innocent civilians and a atomic bomb is dropped on your kid (actually happened in a cod game) but those missions are skippable, which means they warned you about the violence and would let you skip the mission, so they can't be to blame if you played a skippable mission that they warned you about"
18717,"Can you guys make a top 10 surprising team-ups in movies 
if you haven't already."
18718,"Fucking Americans blaming video games for fucking up their children, maybe get rid of your guns and stop letting Johnny play with them"
18719,"BULL FUCKING SHIT
video games are ok"
18720,"I feel like the issue with mas shootings blaming video games is because when one actually happens, instead of researching what caused it, people were just too lazy, and blaming it on video games would be a cheaper and quicker way to get the public's attention off the government"
18721,All these FOX News clips lmao
18722,games don't kill it stupid
18723,yea well some people don't like violence even though it is an everyday thing
18724,"I remember that the highlight in the ""No Russian"" Mission was shooting the suitcases open and watching the clothes fly out everywhere, I didn't shoot anyone, I just shot the suitcases, and then I was shot and killed, I was very sad."
18725,"Petition for manhunt 3, I remember staying up all night when I was 10 playing the original manhunt on ps2. Then manhunt 2 unsencored from a torrent download. Come on rock star."
18726,"We should live in a world with NO novels, movies, paintings, short stories, paintings, creepy pastas should definitely go... Ummmm... Comic books, photography, campfire stories, history (school), television (especially news.. Grotesque!!!), graphic novels, VIDEO GAMES!!!!!!!!, comedy (no laughing allowed), conversation (shhhhh... No talking), religion (come on have you actually seen some of the stories that come out of religious text), mythology has to go, sports altogether... Let's just say we do away with art altogether then everyone will be happy... Right???"
18727,"Simple solution... ""People just need to get over themselves""... Problem solved..."
18728,Like to go back in time to 1992 & show 'em MORTAL KOMBAT X.......
18729,"i play 6 to 7 hours a day when i dont have anything to do, and im the most peaceful person you might ever meet  -warpeace101"
18730,"ive been playin violent video games since mortal kombat first came out on the Sega Genesis and not once have i ever thought to myself, ""hey i wonder if id be able to do this in real life?"""
18731,"All I keep seeing is
""I have to waste tax dollars to bitch about video games."""
18732,"I really don't understand why ""animal cruelty"" is such a big deal. Oh no! we're being too violent to our steak! Its because of Pokemon. Completely ridiculous."
18733,If parents would just do their job and monitor their kids then they wouldn't buy it
18734,I was really looking forward to 6 Days but so many people got butt hurt about it. No one cried about Black Hawk Down or Modern Warfare visiting the Middle East.
18735,"""Because some people lost their children in that battle""
Laughable comment. If that is the reason for not releasing a war game what about all the other war games that were already released at that time. Hypocrites."
18736,"Games don't cause murder, Bullying causes murder"
18737,"Again these are just games people, why all the controversy?!"
18738,"Virtual guns aren't to blame for mass shootings, and real guns aren't either. If I didn't have a gun, I'd just drive a gas tanker into an ISIS mosque at mach 1. People are very good at figuring out ways to kill each other."
18739,"It pisses me off when news stations blame only video games. They say ""It is the video games"". Wake up Fox news it is not, because the parents LET their children play those type of games, but NO, the video game has to be blamed when it is the parents fault for buying the game for them OR letting them buy it themselves. GIVE VIDEO GAMES A F**** BREAK."
18740,Of course they always make something out of nothing
18741,"Am i the only one that wasnt really effected by the torture scene in GTA V? Having an uncle that was in the military and specified in teaching torture methods back during Korea, I grew up assuming it was a regular aspect of warfare and intelligence gathering. People really get their panties in a bunch when they hear about it nowadays."
18742,I feel like if someone is going to murder a bunch of people then it was in them to begin with. A video game will not turn a good person into a mentally disabled person. They need help from the get go.
18743,"Kind of pathetic to see all you sheltered punks cling to your gta copies and other brutal games like spoiled kids. No, video games don't make you a mass murderer.  Yes, mass shooters do play these games.  It's not causal  but to suggest there's no correlation is laughable.  Adam Lanza put fresh clips into his rifle between classrooms... wonder where he learned that?
Also to the author of this video, a shooting claiming dozens of lives might deserve more insight than ""tragic."" 
Don't worry kids, keep shooting."
18744,"How could Pokmon be satanic? does it say ""Satan is awesome and better than God!""
I don't think so."
18745,omg that mw2 news thing you get to kill people and its very realistic never laughed so hard its not like oh this is fun let me try this in real life :D
18746,The most story that pissed me off is mortal Kombat that's offensive to like Mortal Kombat lovers
18747,"Call my views communistic (which they are). The guns on video games do not lead to mass shootings. It leads from the 1 st amendment, to allow everyone to buy guns, and by everyone that means people with mental illnesses people who are radical people who are bent to kill. But to heavily restrict this the 1st amendment to be completely removed. You should have to pass tests staged by health professionals and the government, and must be screened for mental illnesses, and each gun must be licensed with serial coding. They must be screened for past criminal issues and then have to pay for the license that is for the type of weapon ( semi pistols rifles shotguns).  After, they must pay for class license such as class one. Weapons can only be transferred through gun case unloaded and to give the weapon to someone else they must repeat the process"
18748,It just made me like the game more
18749,"So... The US ia a country tjat has many bullying cases, and where a person can buy a gun as easily as they buy a car... And yet everyone blames videogames for mass shootings? REALLY?
I can't understand these pseudo-patriotic conservative idiots. So violence in videogames e terrible, but attacking another country and killing REAL people for oil is acceptable? Seriously?"
18750,PETA is the stupidest groups in the world. All they do is get erection from trees
18751,"Any person who even believes video games are the reason shootings occur, are both idiots and people who hate video games because they didn't have a childhood with games."
18752,I know that this was way before this vid was made but If you guys think this is bad look at a game called Hatred it's awful
18753,As an American I can honestly say I sometimes fucking hate America.
18754,I love first person shooters
18755,man. mojo is so liberal
18756,"I can't believe people thought that the fact that ""no Russian"" was skipable made it an acceptable thing to put in a videogame."
18757,"1:38 THATS THE GUY FROM VINE THAT GOES ""Why, why,why?"""
18758,"the only game that I can understand pissing people off is the one that re-enacted the battle, that lady made a really good point saying she imagines people laughing and stuff about getting killed where her son was actually killed there."
18759,lol the WAH pastor guy.
18760,there is only one thing to say for this voice.. shut the fuck up!!!!!
18761,"Hitler, Castro, Mussolini, Stalin, Genghis Khan, Manson, Mary I, Vlad the Impaler, Kim Il-Sung all must've been playing some intense video games."
18762,5:28 wat eeeheg nice rebuttal
18763,Wait wait wait did all these come from fox news
18764,"why am I not surprised that Fox News is featured as the ""news source"" that highlights on a lot of these ""controversies"".... =.="""
18765,"That one about Atomic losing funding for their war game kinda pisses me off. People died in a war that the game is retelling. So what? People died in both world wars, in Iraq and the middle east. In Korea and Vietnam. Well I guess we have to ban every fucking military shooter ever made then.
I would be willing to lend a hand if Atomic started a kick starter for that game because everyone should have a chance to share their creations with the world."
18766,Definitely Pokmon the pope gave it his blessing said it promoted friendship and did nothing to compromise the youth and people still bitch about it I'm a Christian and see nothing wrong with that when I have kids they will have Pokmon games
18767,this reminds me of how news reporters are assholes
18768,4:55 Dust 2 ?
18769,"For the last one, (#1) it is true that press usually ignores scientific research. I know, because I did some research for a school project on how video games are good for you, and practically everything I read, said video games have NO connection to real life violence. So screw you press."
18770,Reporters just want money they don't give a shit what the story is
18771,FPS makes terrorist? No Fuck dis i am going to play dota2
18772,"I don't get why people think that video games cause murder.
When I was a child I watched star wars, got some sticks and fought against my neighbor (also a child back then) with our new swords. That didn't mean I would run on the street and hit others with it.
When I press a button in GTA to rip someones teeth out of his mouth I still know that that's not what I'm going to do in real life.
That's called conscience and that's what you mostly learn right in first years of your life.
People who don't have conscience and who can't devide between good and bad have totally different problems.
People have to stop thinking that video games are more stupid than a 1 year-old child."
18773,Wouldn't the Battle of Falluja game be just like Call of Duty: Work at War Final Fronts?
18774,"I personally see more social issues with the ""dancing games""... you know the one with the X-box 360 kenect thingy. True I may be conservative, but in my opinion it teaches young kids to dance as if they were in a club. Moving and gyrating parts of their bodies that shouldn't be moving at their age yet ya know?
Let the hate start.......
NOW"
18775,"For once, I completely agree with Mojo's top choice"
18776,"I can understand why people got mad at Manhunt 2 and No Russian, but POKEMON ARE YOU RETARDED"
18777,I like how news anchors just say what they wanna say to make the people they are interviewing to look bad. Right after they get in what they want to say in they move on to the next subject so the person they are interviewing cant respond to what they said.
18778,OH NO! ALL MASS SHOOTERS EAT FOOD! GET RID OF IT! STOP THE MADNESS!
18779,I'm surprised there was no mention of the PC game Rapelay. That was a hell of a controversy. It was worthy of at least an honorable mention.
18780,"these guys always worry about games :)...
but they never do shit ...
bad eng sry..."
18781,"I love how the conservative news media talk about all these restrictions on violent games, ""Oh make this a higher rating, oh don't let these people buy it, we should see how many games they are playing."" etc. but when it comes to gun control they are like NOPE NOPE NOPE. I'm not trying to start an argument about gun control, I promise, but it is funny to me that something that doesn't actually kill someone they want to monitor and restrict but something that does, they don't. Weird."
18782,(Will Farrell whispering) it's a fucking game
18783,in mass effect that blue chic is a hermaphadite so they got that wrong. I also find it funny when people complain about something yet they know nothing about it.
18784,Blaming a video game is the best thing they can do. They never see the real problems
18785,"Would definitely have to be the absurd claims that video games make killers, myself and my siblings of various ages have played games since we were young say since like seven and up, fighters like Tekken, Mortal Kombat & Soul Caliber, Shooters like Halo, Horrors like RE & Nightmare Creatures, Rpgs like SWKOTOR, ME & FF, platformers like Spyro & Harry Potter, whatever freaking category Pokemon falls under, open world/rpg like gta & Skyrim and yes i have a point, not once not ever have ever been like ""yes i'm gonna go out and get a sword with the intention of running around like a freaking Skyrim character nor will i ever go out driving bashing into police vehicles thinking that money will pop out everywhere, speaking of magic maybe i'll go get my wand with the intention of freezing people, i have never seen the justification about killers being born from playing games make any freaking sense at all, but we never go to the parents (apologies to parents out there who this does not apply to because it sure as hell doesn't apply to mine) these people let their kids run rampant don't pay any attention to what they are doing until it's to late i was on a video the other day and a child commented that they are 11 years old and that they watch The Game Of Thrones, no i am not saying GOT causes kids to become crazed killers anymore than games but that is fucking ridiculous and disturbing, as for the ones were it has nothing to do with parenting and foundation (which is rare) i'm no psychologist but maybe some people just aren't born right in the head they think right is wrong and vice versa, but it is lazy and irresponsible for these people in the media to blame those horrible crimes on video games instead of trying to find the real problems"
18786,"Yeah ok i understand some of the things like gta kinda mk (even though i've played it for years and have never attempted a bleeping fatality) as well as the army games (i sure as hell wouldn't want a game made based on one of the worst losses of my life as well as so many others) but come on Pokemon? really? this is my first time hearing about that i did not know about that at all it's just like really? as is the crap about mass effect good grief all you see is side-chest, & i am a woman and i didn't see any thing romance dialog both genders can end chatting to two different characters and then it's their own fault end up in an awkward conversation with both parties were they have to choose which seems fair to me, peta is retarded nuff said, i don't feel the need to try justify that pretty much kill-for-sport what ever it was game but my last issue....."
18787,i own saint row iv and i bought in a Australia and i live here no games are banned any more
18788,"Oh come on, the Mass Effect sex scenes were full of realism. Hasn't everyone mind-melded with a blue alien chick at least once in their lives?"
18789,"to be fair though, the player did kiiiiiiiinda got to shoot like, alot of unarmed civilians in mw2 though. but the main problem i have with that level was it was hard as shit for me!!!!! i died like 20 times!"
18790,"You want to be popular ? It's easy : say you play World of Warcraft and a TV channel will film you with the headlines : ""Video games are for bad, mean and nazi people""."
18791,Games don't make a killer. What has happened in their lives make the killer. People who have had a bad childhood or had something bad happen to them in the past can make a person get mixed feels about things. Yes I play first shooter games but I'm no killer.
18792,"5:28 Wtf, that dude needs a translator."
18793,"Wait, you can make a game about a war that lasted years that led to the death of countless lives on both sides, but can't make one that recounted a battle that lasted 6 days?"
18794,whats wrong with a bit of contraversie if it never happend we wood not have cod or battlefield not even minecraft
18795,I'm surprised they didn't bring up gamergate...
18796,See SEE YOUR NOT HELPING INFINITYWARD

18799,I live in finland and here there has never been any gaming controversies not even from manhunt or mw2.
18800,Its a game dumbass not real life
18801,Remember... no Russian
18802,"I know it was only covered by one station, but it really pissed me off when Channel 4 blamed Habbo Hotel for all perversion on the internet. The stupidity of the accusation alone was hilariously infuriating."
18803,"Its the media and some people that make such a big deal about it. They forget that video games are fictional, not reality and arn't that realistic"
18804,"You know of they had real hard evidence that can prove that games to really actually cause ""violence"" then I'll just accept it because they have facts, but now they're just pointing fingers at games all they want because...... well because they just want to . Even though thousands hell millions of people in the world find all of this to be bullshit , they still want to talk shit about games. This is one of the fucking stupid things that gamers have to bare , when we are like being accused of being potential killers or some other bad shit. Its just so fucking dumb. Why do they blame games instead of the murderer, that's like saying a bullet is guilty for the murder, not the guy ,"" breaking news, bullets are the cause of numerous deaths"" . Hey parents and people who think games make us ""violent "" , games are just fucking entertainment , even research of scientists said that games don't cause violence but yet improve our brain memory and strategy thinking. Man I really hope this shit stops, because this thing going on here right here is becoming a controversy by itself"
18805,"All these retarded people who don't know shit about VGs it's killing are children. I play Halo with 12 year old son and we both love it, they think VGs are bad, my son just helped someone he saw was about to commit suicide and stopped him."
18806,"Every last story on every last video game shown here, really ticked me off.
1st of all, games like MK and COD, are just fun to play, video games dont turn children into killers, people need to rethink alot of things on video games. Grown ass adults are killing people, from toddlers to 50 and 60 yr old people, what kid or kids have you heard of killing for no reason besides the shooting in Columbine, NONE, And the only reason the 2 students killed alot of people at Columbine was because they were bullied, video games didnt do that to them bullying did. Its mostly adults killing people, dont blame the kids cause they haven't killed anyone."
18807,How about Texas chainsaw massacre on atari
18808,lol an evil villain is taunting you making fun of you being adopted and it makes the news! lmfao hes the bad guy for the reason.
18809,"Now, Hatred is most controversial."
18810,i dont understand wy they blame games i play gta and cod am i gonna shoot a bunch of people no. blame the parents
18811,"If parents would start acting like parents, then maybe we wouldn't have children playing such controversial games. I assume the problem is when children play it because let's be honest, worrying about adults playing these games is absolutely ridiculous. They're big kids, let them wipe their own asses."
18812,"I love how WatchMojo remains neutral, but you can tell that they've got their heads screwed on in the process."
18813,Why do people think that games MAKE people kill others? I find it quite stupid.
18814,So many news stations and other people/organizations are apparently not taught that it's actually the persons mental state on how they take video games because I have played most of the gta games and cod games quite frequently and haven't had thoughts of violence although I have a short temper it was what I was born with though
18815,Oh Sheet...
18816,The sex scenes would just piss my grandma off...
18817,I can pick apart ANY of these arguments those idiots bring up
18818,FFS I HATE THESE LITTLE BITCHES THAT STOP GAMES BECAUSE THEY ARE OFFENDED THOSE PPL SHOULD BE SET ON FIRE!
18819,american reporters are shiit! they wont listen to someone else and suddenly they change the subject
18820,"The headline at 6:23 made me laugh. Also, if they're mad about No Russian letting you ""be a terrorist"", look at FUCKING COUNTERSTRIKE. TERRORISM IS ENCOURAGED! But I digress as this is a mute point."

18836,If no Russian isn't in this list from cod mw2 story this list is shit
18837,It got me pissed when people went crazy over hatred
18838,"It's not stupid America it's stupid everywhere, there are multiple cases that were talked about around the world about video games, there is no fix there is no fighting. If you wanna blame these controversies on America then your just as guilty as the press that blames violence on video games"
18839,"I love when people blame games for the things that happen such as shootings, lets see that person did not play the game and then oh that's like real life and it's not illegal all of a sudden i'm going to do it, no they have some form of problem or are just plan idiotic enough to do it so next time a shooting happens and i see the blame games im gonna lose it. It's not true just stop."
18840,What is wrong with our society? If there is one single killing its blamed on videogames the real thing that should be blamed is the family or mental state
18841,I didn't know there was a sex simulator in gtasa
18842,"These reporters don't even care to have any knowledge about video games. They said in MW2 ""you play the role of a terrorist."" When in the game you play as a soldier and in the mission ""No Russian"" you play as a special ops agent."
18843,"So they're saying that because I play violent shooters and games outside my age rating than I'm gonna become a mass murderer or a gangster and be really stupid. Its stupid because not all people are like that, we don't play to learn how to become violent and to learn how to kill a lot of people, we play to pass the time and because we enjoy playing games. Also It's bullshit what they're saying, and I play a lot of games not for me like mortal kombat and call of duty for example, but i have a 3.9- 4.0 gpa so far in high school and I'm also really nice towards others."

18846,And the Pokemon controversy are just stupid because I've played Pokemon as a child it was one of the best childhood experience and my mom she loved it too even the anime too it is just the greatest thing too despite the seizure event and certain things like jinx and James cross dressing scene but the worst part is what PETA did to it making us look bad cause us who catch Pokemon gives us an influence  to abuse animals that's insane
18847,"I find it ridiculous how people make such a huge deal over sex but violence is ok. Like the Hot Coffee mod you censored for example. It didn't even have nudity! lol yet you didn't censor the guys getting brutally murdered in all the other games. I'm not putting you down for doing it, I'm just saying that's a shining example of how backwards we are when it comes to sex and violence. Sex = pleasure, Violence = pain and death. Which one do you think is more psychologically damaging? Sex is never a bad thing unless it's COMBINED with violence. I'm actually currently working on a video about this actually."
18848,"After hearing the intent study of these reporters of how video games can lead people to do bad things, I had only one choice to do in my life!
Vigorously I ripped out every drawer in my home and threw away every sharp object and silverware in my possession, including all of my self-protection firearms, and will now proceed to rip my computer from it's wall and throw it out into the woods to live like a neanderthal in the stone age.
Because spoons and forks make people fat, guns and knives kill people, video games cause others to go on murderous rampages, and the possibility of me even eating or breathing puts others at potential risk for my diluted madness that I have descended into after all these years, because obviously I will one day go out and kill a load of innocent people after all this exposure to danger and violence!"

18853,"Oh my god all these fucking news idiots and bitches complaining and chopping fingers off because of the Modern Warfare 2 No Russian mission. First of all, it's your choice to pull the trigger and kill all the civilians. The mission does NOT require you of doing that! Everybody thinks you have to kill them, but trust me, even I've done this. Sit back and refuse to ""brutally murder them which starts wars and shit and video gamers leading to mass murders"" well fuck that I restarted the mission and just let Makarov and his buddies kill them. I didn't touch a button. And second, IT'S A GAME. It simulates the terrorism and killing to the players so they can realize what it's like being undercover or whatsoever  in it. It's not supposed to be fun, but yeah it's satisfying knowing that you didn't die in multiplayer. That's what a real soldier would feel. And it's sometimes fun having killed the enemy because they're an ENEMY! They're the bad people that should be gone, and you feel good that you took them out so they can't hurt anyone else. Boom bitches."
18854,"Oh government of video games cause violence, what video game was available to the public during the 11-17 century none that's what like honest to ....

18855,"Lol mortal Kombat one is on that, I wonder how those ppl would react to Mortal Kombat X"
18856,Blaming video games for killings is like blaming guns for killings. You don't ban the object you blame the person using the object as a tool for harm.
18857,how stupid are this hypocrites are?? getting to something that they don't know about. its like asking a retard twat to criticize a book that they didn't even read. thats how stupid they are. ike their brain went on a fucking vacation to bermuda triangle and never came back.

Honestly I love America because uhh it's my home country yeah we did a lot of bad shit but so did other countries. The news is the news and they do shit like that just to do it and get views, just like the guy said ""on a slow day"". Also, if you didn't play video games you guys would probably share most of the ideas these people had and opinions. Some of you honestly don't even know that these news reporters are American I mean the owner of Fox News is an Australian republican lol Australian are you kidding me. But hey yeah just because they speak English they're American because I don't hear them have a typical English accent that most of you guys can't even differ from Australian. The GTA controversy and #1 is respectable and can be understood why they would think that the rest are plain dumb IMO. Again this is my opinion I'm sorry if I seem like a ""dumb American who's so uptight and only wants to justify with dumb shit because they can""."
18879,"Lol people are stupid. POKEMON IS DEMONIC!! IT TEACHERS KIDS WITCHCRAFT!!! Seriously? They don't even fucking know what they are talking about. YOU CAN GO ON RAMPAGES AND KILL EVERYONE!! Yeah, so what? It's a video game, queer arse! xD"
18880,stupid sacks of shit bitchin' over a game
18881,If a person is god damm crazy and goes wild every one blames a video game.That means there wasn t any crimes and masacres before the video games where put on the market. WTF.Video games got nothing to do with that bullshit that all the news where talking about.You CAN NOT blame a video game for the prooblems in the world
18882,"Call of Duty Mw2. 
I did not like  the fact at the start u killed all of those innocent people. I always turned.so i didnt face the when that happened. Ut shouldnt have been there ."
18883,Maybe if they actually new the context of most of these controversies
18884,Fuck the us goverment i play alot of 1st person shooters but dont feel the need to go shoot everybody
18885,"My top 10 video game controversies as of 2015:
1: GamerGate
2: EA Games
3: Sega
4: Ubisoft
5: Nintendo
6: Microtransactions
7: Pirate Bay
8: Commercializing mods
9: Sarkeesian
10: Fallujah
Last was a toss up between Fallujah and Hatred. Honestly I don't think either should be on this list, but a whole lot of people still feel the need to pretend to hold very strong, politically correct opinions. Fallujah takes the cake because it somewhat touches on the much greater real-life issue of the militaristic jingoism that American citizens are being conditioned to worship."
18886,top 10 Nancy Grace Fails
18887,"there are problems in the world,
first thing they blame? video games.
Course dealing with the actual problem would just be to much trouble.
1 person shoots people and they blame it on video games, casually ignoring all the BILLIONS of other people who play video games and are the nicest people you could ever meet
I love how they keep saying Australia has so much stuff they don't sell, do they really think that's going to stop people living in Australia from playing them? they most likely have a game piracy number that would blow your mind.
There is also something really wrong with American news it seems, in my country I rarely hear something on the news that's outrageous or strange, but on the American news you can apparently get a job if you are large enough a ass to keep on talking while you give the other person who is trying to talk no space to say something, and are enough of a idiot to keep on tossing one stupid accusation after another.
Its as if they get the information from there reporters, but then spin up there own story about it afterwards that fits there own perspective instead. How is that bringing the news?"
18888,"I was confused one time a news show I thought it was dateline but don't quote me, said that video games could be to blame for colmbine and then show ff7 footage."
18889,Notice that it's Faux News that has the loudest voice over things that they clearly don't even bother looking into to get the full story.
18890,The funny thing is all these news reports are from Fox News
18891,"this stuff in american media is ridiculous, i played a lot of FPS games, all of them we kill other ones, i also played postal,another controversial, and i never thought in killing no 1, people who did shit was because they are shit, not because of games, so stop being ignorant and look at the real problem, like what women told at the end, psychological problems, period. they just happened to play video games too."
18892,"They used to blame suicide on heavy metal lyrics, now they blame violence on video games.
The reality is - some people are mentally ill. Doesn't matter what they listen to or watch. Blaming their actions on the music they listen to or the games they play is a cop out, and ignores the tens of millions of gamers who play every day with no problems."
18893,The majority of my friends and I have played most kinds of video games from a young age and we are not running around shooting civilians. Obviously if you are insane in the first place you will do whatever you think.
18894,"black woman at the end , u so ri8"
18895,"Yes, in real life I hit Left Trigger on my controller to shoot in real life."
18896,I played manhunt 2 uncensored when I was like 9 and I haven't turned into a vicious serial killer. Saying that violent video games make you a psycho is just a load of bullshit. These reporters are so stupid.
18897,OMG! Yogscast jim at 3:45
18898,Moral of the video: They want us to play Minecraft!
18899,Whenever this happens I fell dissappear to people blaming video gwmes
18900,"It's hard to stomach the fact that people think that [everyone] is going to go out of their way after playing with fake guns in a game to go an use a real one.
After I play a good game, the only thing I'd go and do in real life is cosplay as the main character."
18901,You suck
18902,please someone explain to me how pokemon is casting spells?
18903,Gta4 is not violent
18904,that is some fine product placement
18905,People are just so stupid these days u know its a darn video game whats it going to do come out of the screen and shoot you or make fun of you i just want to uuuuuurghh
18906,OK the no Russian level from MW2 i can kind of understand. I mean you are gunning down civilians in an airport. and i know you don't actually need to start shooting until the cops show up but that is the only level I've ever seen that gives you an option to skip before it start.
18907,I forgot that only conservatives hate video games.... Im sooooo sick of Watch Mojo's bullshit liberal bias!!!!
18908,"I've been playing violent games since I was 3, honestly, I've never wanted to pick up a gun and run around killing people. That's what Saints row and Borderlands is for"
18909,"Give your citizens easy access to deadly weaponry, then blame all the crime on somebody else...
...'MURICA!!!"
18910,The Russian airport massacre was absolutely awful.
18911,North Americans are retards lol!! They are stuck in the XVI century!! Those mentalityes are completely stupid!! In other countries there arent psycopaths like in the US and its not games fault
18912,"a now with the Game Hatred coming soon the number 1 will shine again when some stupid  that cannot difference reality from fantasy cause a disgrace( let's hopecthat don't happen), all the media will blame again the videogames."
18913,People really shouldn't take Fox News seriously.
18914,So books are satanic because the catcher in the rye killed John Lennon? Truuueeee
18915,and BOOM goes the dynamite
18916,"These controversies are down to the person's mental state. I've been playing violent and gory video games since I was 8 years old. I played all the GTA games and manhunt and games with sex, drugs, alcohols and all that stuff. I'm almost 22 years old now and I don't smoke, never take drugs. I've never even been to prison so when people say blame the games for these crimes. I say don't play them if you are not mentally stable."
18917,Fucking hell seriously? Fox is a piece of shit news place.
18918,"If Video games truly did affect people, there would be thousands of professional farmers coming out of facebook."
18919,"Media during No Russian: Ban the game! Me during No Russian: Dammit, I'm out of ammo."
18920,I belive that no russian scene could be excluded from mw2
18921,How fucking sensitive are people? Specially in america. Sorry but i hear those incredibky stupid criticizms only from there. Pisses me off..
18922,"When that guy talked about pokemon...
Just... go die in a corner .."
18923,Kim was in this video :D
18924,"In my opinion, violent video games are good for people with anger management issues. They allow people to take their anger out on fictional characters without the consequences of real life.
If somebody caused a school shooting BECAUSE they liked Call of Duty, then that person needs mental help."
18925,THEY ARE GAMES NO ONE FUCKING CARES IF THEY ARE RACISTS OR NOT KIDS WONT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'ER TALKING ABOUT
18926,"it funny that people that have no knowledge about the subject are the one that argue the most. Yes i'm talking about the news anchor and those ""experts"" they chose to interview on live TV that will support their believes. Maybe these people should do a research report that uses peer reviewed source before they can claim anything instead of looking for ""experts"" that will support their argument. That's why I have not watch TV for the last 8 years. These TV programs are making kids dumber than the video games itself. Maybe they should shut down all the News programs and make kids and adults go to the library database to search for information rather than sitting in front of TV listen to dumbasses that don't know what the hell they are talking about."
18927,
18928,"I live in australia and most gamers here want uncensored game but can't have it.
(sorry for shit grammar I just wanted to write this comment quick."
18929,"so, there is no reason for people to blame anyone but themselves. if your kid participates in a school shooting, its not because they play any kind of videogames! it is because there is something going on at school or home that you havent dealt with or dont know about it. yeah, i play call of duty and battle field. yes i want to be in the military or law enforcement. but they arent linked. i want to have those kinds of jobs because of the people i know that have them. and what would banning video games do anyways? they would still be available for download on pirated sites. and what about the ones that people already own? then it will turn into getting rid of tv and radio and books. anything and everything that people can use to find out about this stuff. and what will you do when no one wants to join the military or police? Have a forced signup? seriously, just deal with it and stop trying to push the blame on other people!"
18930,"we just have to be patient untill the old fucks generation pass, so we, all the people who grew up with it, with no problem, will be in peace... fuck media, and fuck christian criticism to everything..."
18931,"You are afraid of video games because you don't know it. To you it's satanic and witchcraft because you are not influenced by it. OPEN YOUR BLOODY EYES! They are only video games, a code that is physically interacted, it will NOT psychologically affect anybody. GOVERNMENT ARE STUPID!"
18932,"guess what we have the same games in australia, but better gun laws than the US and no school shooting, wise the fuck up and look at the real problem.........."
18933,"in our country there was the same discussion: the man was playing Mafia 1, he was drunk, he was slightly drugged, but you know what? lets blame it on the f*cking game... because drugs are safe right?"
18934,I like the idea of amassacre in a russian airport
18935,"Ermm, what was number 1# ? xD"
18936,Long Live Mortal Kombat!
18937,Its very realistic yeah if it was very realistic should you be dead from one shot from a police officer or swat?
18938,naw russian
18939,I belive that if a person is physically normal the game won't make any infludence to kill somebody.
18940,"Game at 3:25?
I need it for science."
18941,"I've been quickly scanning through the comments and I got to be honest. I think first person shooters are a bit too violent, but I don't ""hate"" the games. I never played c.o.d or gtaV or stuff like that, but I would love to at least one day try them out. But at the same time, if I went to my friends house for a videogame group meet-up and if we all brought videogames to play, all of us are gonna bring rp games or platform games, and if somebody did bring a first person shooter, then, we would all agree to play it last. I don't have anything against games like those, even if I'm more of an indie gamer, but all I see in the comments is people defending their games, tbh, I was gonna defend pokemon, but I saw that somebody already did that. I really wanna say ""It's just a game!!"" and it is! The people in the gaming community know that but nobody else does, at least the people who assume stuff. It's like saying ""The Titanic is a terrible movie. That's why I didn't see it."" You are literally saying that a movie that you never saw is terrible. Your not digging to figure out the story and the plot and blah blah blah. Maybe try watching it and you might like it, and the same goes for videogames. That is how I feel when people assume stuff, and I know I'm not the only one by reading the comments on this video. Ugh, there is still so much to say, but I don't wanna write a long ass comment for a thought that not only I have, but that all gamers have."
18942,nice watchmojo censored
18943,Super Columbine Massacre RPG anyone?
18944,Now #1 is Hatred game
18945,"The only thing that pissed me off about the GTA V torture scene was how much buttonmashing it took to pull the tooth out.
Also, the reason conservatives are the primary whiners about shooting games is because they want to divert the argument away from gun rights."
18946,Honestly people. 1's and 0's cannot drive us to these acts of terror unless we choose to let them.
18947,We got L4D2 in 2014. And we have a censored and uncut version.
18948,Yet in the states it's just as easy to purchase a firearm as it is a video game.
18949,Video Games dont make us violent ... Lag does
18950,"I wonder, what controversy will be stirred up when Hatred comes out? I think that some games probably go too far with the violence when the objective is to harm the innocent"
18951,really? Pokmon with all of you friendly and cuteness that has... they think is the World from the Devil!?!?!? WTF is WRONG WITH THIS PEOPLE!?!?!?!
18952,I love the wii you can play madworld on it...
18953,"I love how there was a prominent fox news clip in the mortal kombat story from 1992... Fox news didn't exist then!!! Fox news started In October 1996!!! I know we are ALL supposed to hate fox news but this is pushing it. The only stupid sound bites used in this video wrre taken from fox news Hey, how about the collection of liberal senators trying to get games banned... not once, not twice, multiple times! Hillary still wants certain games banned and has talked about it after every school shooting in recent history! Tipper Gore anyone???  How about 1993 when ABC, NBC CBS and CNN all came out and declared videogames too violent and called for a ban? No? Couldn't find the footage?? Or didn't bother? Penn and Teller found it for their show Bullshit..."
18954,"1) postal 2 should have been on this list and 2) games like postal are based on choice; you're supposed to go out and get some milk or some shot but people just killed other people, they did that at their own free will and on the video game. Instead of being influenced by a game they just did it, right off the bat 3) fox you are bunch of horse shit"
18955,"SR4 and State of Decay weren't banned in Australia. 
Almost every game I've heard to have been banned here has not been."
18956,"What if there was a game that involves castration? Yeah, I think that would spark up some controversy like fireworks on the 4th of July."
18957,What a load of right-wing conservative bollocks! Nutters were killing people long before video games came along.
18958,i. must. get. Manhunt 2.... the first one was fucking nuts.
18959,"If is game is rated M and underneath the M it says there is sexual content in the game, no one should be complaining about sex scenes in games"
18960,"Virtual weapons and violence exist because real weapons and violence exist.
Just like in film, these games are made based on reality, sometimes a very cruel, harsh and quite frankly horrible reality."
18961,I like how they mention conservative media and also show MSNBC.. Which is FAR from a conservative news network.
18962,who was the certain advocate in florida who shall not be named?
18963,fuck fox lol
18964,"But in the Cod ,you has the choice to jump the mission , and they explained so i think that who entered the phase, entered because they want , I entered and i was NOT shocked , I've undestand that the level is violent but whas a choice you can jump the phase."
18965,Video games don't kill people. People kill people
18966,Pokemon... the Pokemon one that got me angry when I read about it. I broke my computer monitor because of that page.
18967,rly? end of 2013 (almost 2014) and only fu**ing 480p ?!?
18968,What's the game in 3:29? For research purposes.
18969,Kim from the yogcast
18970,"What I find to be ironic is that for every single ""controversy"" the only news outlet shown losing their minds is Fox News. We could argue political stances, but that's for another post. In all honesty, what's the problem with sex & violence in video games? At the end of the day, they're pixels. That's all they are. That's all they ever will be."
18971,"People don't understand that it's not the video games that causes violence. It either has to be an already messed up individual who gets triggered by the violence they see or, a young child who doesn't understand the consequences of actually brining that violence to the real world. Parents are always complains about violence but then they give little nine year olds call of duty and grand theft auto."
18972,Make another one!!!!!!
18973,fox news is soooooo lame. whyyyyy cant they just shut up
18974,Kind of surprised that noone of those crybabys have complaind on Civilazation where you can commit massgenocide
18975,News reporters guess what? Almost everyone who is 18 and below has played a first person shooter..... so basically I am a murderer apparently :/
18976,"I hate people who think video games cause mass shootings. They don't, the people do. I play tons of violent games and never hurt anyone."
18977,People are so sensitive nowadays
18978,No russian really should have been a cutscene rather than a mission.
18979,I love how almost all of the controversies were aired on fox news lol.
18980,Nothing on Counter-Strike? The Columbine shooters played that one.
18981,USA is so double moral
18982,"anyone realize that for however many religious organisations that say representations of magic in video games is demonic, in almost every video game, religious powers are pretty much categorized as magic."
18983,so according to number 4 any game based of any real war should be gotten rid of because it insults the people related to those that died in the war.
18984,Hey media networks ever consider that there was violence before video games?
18985,Sandy Hook never happened. It was a ploy by the media.
18986,"Gta v was banned in Australian target stores, Im not side If it's back in there now though"
18987,Lol US news stations blame video games for mass shootings when almost anyone can get a gun pretty easily. When was the last time you heard of a 1st world mass shooting outside of the US?
18988,"Someone stabs his friend?
He takes fighting lessons and is mentally ill?
Has never played videogames?
Hasn't seen any movies where people die?
Let's ban manhunt 2!
(This was only an example of how stupid people are)"
18989,helps tell an event that few people know a bout.
18990,"People die all the time. Its a fact of life. Get over yourselves. A game is a story and nothing more. If we alow our selfs to ban games over war and other crap, movies will be next and so on. These are people who live in the delusion that if these games go away that the vilonce will go away. They ignore the science that disproves there arguments and just play a blame game to justify there points. Im sorry your loved ones died i really am, but being a soldier there is a lot that goes with that and dieing is a posibility. Now before anyone says anything im not saying that it sould be brodcasted as a joke or a funtime, but a game that retells an event like that one game on this list"
18991,"Yeah, scientific research has pretty much ruled out that video games cause violence. Which is why now the argument is that they cause violence against women instead."
18992,"what's wrong with pokemon? its a fun addictive game
I've never looked at it as harming animals or in any negative way"
18993,Ehem GoW?
18994,People always blame video games whenever there is a shooting only because the game has guns.
18995,I cannot stand the American right wing media - so poisonous they defend religion all the time when it's religion which is directly responsible for the deaths and misery of millions around the world
18996,"Everyone forgets ""State of Emergency"" on PS2. That was simply violence for violence's sake. Plus it was pretty hard."
18997,I was 6 when i first played mortal kombat on the n64 and i loved it since then i wouldn't allow my son to play mkx though because the good graphics
18998,Remember folks if Pikachu hits that Thundershock you're going to Hell.
18999,"This what the Earth is today, full of retards who don't even do their own research"
19000,Here comes the parents and trolls saying nonsense again saying such and such should be banned for no legit reason.
19001,Watch dogs should first
19002,"""People lost their children."" 
So we prevent a video game from being made because of that, BUT WE DON'T SHUT DOWN FAST FOOD PLACES? WE DON'T OUTLAW ALCOHOL OR TOBACCO? WTF!?
McDonald's alone helps kill thousands of people, and makes kids super fat... But no, lets bitch about a video game. 
Humans make me sick."
19003,"Uhhh didn't the guy that did the massacre in Aurora, Colorado hate shooting games? His favorite game was guitar hero or rock band..."
19004,"im all for games being violent and gory, but I'm not going to lie, the first time i played no russian in mw2 i was so shocked."
19005,"Lol I've played Fifa and Pes and I am still not messi, wtf am I doing wrong?"
19006,Satanic creatures?! Animal abuse?!! No!! I do not want to think of Pokmon like that!!
19007,Jack Thomson pisses me off that dude would blame world hunger on video games if he could.
19008,I notice how many of the controversies come from the land of the freedom of speech aka America! Or is it just me?
19009,but you got to admit manhunt 2 was really fun and the story was decent
19010,What really pisses me of is mainstream societies ignorance. An ignorance of the fact that video games mirror real life games in the way they portray violence. In fact real life is and probably always will be more violent than any game anyone can make
19011,"Guess i will swing my Greatsword around as Dark Souls 2 totally teaches me that. Just like Dying Light made me a parkour master, Guitar Hero a guitarist, Red Faction a professional Demolist with a god damn Unicorn pooping rainbows and Dragonball a super-human being able to destroy planets and stuff...oh wait."
19012,Note how it's Fox News moaning the most.....
19013,"How often they're playing and how often they buy games... Dumb fucking fox news cunts again. So lets say the terrorists who strap themselves with explosives sometimes drink tea.
Maybe we should outlaw tea because it has a strong link to terrorism."
19014,That cunt on fox news omg....
19015,5:28 we need an exorcism
19016,News fucking ruins everything
19017,I love how the government and media have to jump on absolutely everything just so that they can get the heat off of them for once. Oh a VIDEO GAME just came out and we don't want to let people know that we killed a hundred people today?? Let's band together and rag on a VIDEO GAME! Idiots. Democracy my ass. Aliens take me with you through my screen...
19018,"Remember, no Russian."
19019,cant people stop being pussies
19020,"I usually hate making a big deal of things, but I personally found #3 utterly disgusting. I am Russian and I can't believe that they would make a mission massacring hundreds of innocent Russians simply because of their nationality. I have lived in Australia my whole life, so I am not biased. I know Russia has had a troubled past with communism and what not, but that is simply cruel and unacceptable."
19021,"So... we can have sex, drugs and murder in movies that only require an 'R' rating.
Where is my adults only video games?
""Oh well sales for the video game-""
""Shut the fuck up. I killed an 11 year old girl today in GTA V. Literally. An 11 year old girl was playing GTA V, and I shot her in the face. Maybe if people gave a shit things would be different."""
19022,"I hate the people that say ""PEEPLZ THATT PLAI ZELDA MUST WERSHIP SATAN BECUZ TRYFORCE IS ILLUMINATI"" Because they OBVIOUSLY never played Zelda before. You go around SAVING THE WORLD NOT FUCKING WORSHIPING A BEING THAT DOESN'T EVEN EXIST."

19025,"As a veteran of the Iraq War, I agree: fuck those terrorist video games. Je suis Charlie!"
19026,that one in the airport on modern warfare 2 though was pretty deep tbh
19027,"Resolution to the school shootings: 
Try to have a little more than 1-2 police officers on campus at all times."
19028,#7=bullshit
19029,"why are people blaming games!!!! people use guns in real life because they think about it and want to go through with a plan they came up with. What, just because i play Mortal Kombat means that i want to sub zero freeze a bitch? NO!!!! I just like the game because it is entertainment. Oh, but all the violence in movies is ok, right? fuck the media, let us live our lives!"
19030,Im surprised swatting wasn't on this list.
19031,what no russian mission was fckt up :/
19032,well that 'no Russian' mission in modern warfare 2 is kind disturbing...
19033,"ok, only people with psychological problems can be influenced by video game violence, its funny how some news paper or media argue and discuss a video game element like its a national news, omg pokemon has turned my son into an animal abuse twat!! Help!!If you found your children acts weird because of a video game, take him to the asylum or get to a therapist."
19034,"Why you always got to blame video games blame movies, music, bad parenting and dumbass muthefuckers who don't have a brain."
19035,And remember no Russian
19036,"""My son didn't have that choice""
Ok... I do. What of it. You don't have to play the game. 
Your son isn't in the game. So shut the fuck up bitch!"
19037,The girls on Fox News seem like the BIGGEST bitches on earth
19038,"Why don't people talk about violent movies or music? It's always video games that get the bad rep. If video games make people violent, I should be Public Enemy #1"
19039,"It's just stupid adults who don't even PLAY THE GAME and watch ONE CLIP and be like ""VIDEO GAMES ARE BAD FOR EVERYONE LETS BAN THEM ALL AND ONLY RELEASE MARIO KART AND ELMO GAMES :O"" I want to go to congressmen/women and give a SPEECH (which would be the best speech ever btw) about how games aren't bad! That's MENTALY RETRDED PEOPLE who do that!!! (RETRDED BECUS they think of that). My parents say 'if you don't do it irl, then U can play it, it's not like you're killing real people'. My parents make sence..."
19040,"Yeah, definately, killing poeple in call of duty will make someone turn into a psycho and kill poeple irl. The l reason why they do that is BECUS they are fucked up...like NORMAL people will go around and cause a huge terrorist attack in an airport causing ww3... -_-"
19041,"I think number one should be the no Russian mission from mw2, so many countries were frustrated"
19042,There will be a special place in hell for Jack Thompson.
19043,is it just me or are most news reporters just giant twats who think they rule the fucking world
19044,Did you know Bubble Bobble was intended as a freaky old school porn game? The 'bubbles' were supposed to be made of spooge and the goal was to impregnate as many monsters as possible.
19045,Ok mabye games make some people violent and they go on and kill people but all the anti game people act like its just for the games we play now adays but thats not the case there have been huge murder crimes before games like cod and gta came out does any one know about the zodiac killer he was a killer in San Francisco that killed more than 30 people and that was back in the 60s and I dont think the games back then would of made that guy do those things
19046,"I like how everyone forgets that there are also these more realistic things called MOVIES that show gore/blood/terrorism/shooting. But no videogames are to blame here cause yes if a guy fires a real gun it doesn't matter. The gun can't kill people without a user, but videogames can push people to commit massive murders. That way of thinking just kills me because that's how stupid people can be. If you can't distinguise reality from a game then you are just stupid and there is no one to blame."
19047,"So they're saying games induce the behavior portrayed. Fuck yea, I'm gonna start geeking on 2K15, then I'll be better than Shaq and MJ combined."
19048,gta 5 its better you do what you do in the game in the game and not in real life
19049,"Game about nazis: It's okay because the nazis are evil
Game about terrorists (9/11): THE CREATOR OF THIS GAME IS A IDIOT FUCK EVEN THOUGH IT IS ABOUT KILLING TERRORISTS IT'S OFFENSIVE AND BAD BANNED WORLDWIDE
lol"
19050,Im surprised thrill kill didnt made it to this list.
19051,Isn't that the girl from Different Strokes at 2:23?
19052,Pokemon is satanic! Didn't know
19053,"What pisses me off are those politicians or TV people who blame alot of this on games, and they say that ""oh he played Call of Duty where you kill people"" or ""He played GTA"", How can the 360 controller teach someone how to work a gun? sure it has triggers but that's not all, you need to learn how to reload a gun, turn off the safety and also, another thing that they don't pull into this is that sure the controller rumbles but when you shoot a gun, the force knockback is so strong that you can't mimic it in a controller.... so please Politicians and people on the TV... PLAY THE GAMES BEFORE YOU BLAME THEM! same thing with the Wii version of Manhunt 2, sure you mimic the motion but the Wii mote is a lot lighter than a real sledgehammer or sword, it's like saying ""oh I play guitar hero a lot so I know how to play a real guitar"""
19054,"Maybe if people aren't stable enough to play these video games they shouldn't play them.
And don't give me bullshit that they are violent  it's the people who play the game that decide to let that kind of shit go to their head."
19055,C
19056,"What the hell is that noise that dude makes at 5:28??
It is incredible!!!!!!!!!!"
19057,"It annoys me greatly when people have to blame guns and violent games on such terrible tragedies. I am a child of the 80's and 90's where I played violent games. Shoot em ups, racing, hunting and yet I have never felt any inkling to do violence up my fellow humans. Sure I can fantasize about it but doing it IRL is another. Guns and video games don't kill people. people kill people. Since the decay of the modern family as we all try to keep our heads above financial death and single parent households lead to hordes of latchkey kids running around within the past 50 years, kids will lash out, whether for the search for attention or out of anger. Give a friendly ear to someone in pain, give them a shoulder to lean on when they are down and stop blaming video games for psychotic rampages."
19058,I love FPSs but I've yet to actually kill people because of a video game. Those kids who shot and killed people were probably mentally challenged or their actions caused by a result of lack of proper parenthood.
19059,I love how you gotmost ofyour anti-game footage from fox news lol!!!!
19060,anyone want to hear a joke?
19061,I think that jack tomphson sould be number 1 and know his not a vid game character
19062,"American reporters seem like the biggest fucking idiots, like they haven't done there research properly or just don't know there shit.
Also that they will always find a different excuse for mass shootings when the problem is there fucking gun laws."
19063,Ahhh America...where you can give your kids drugs and guns and if they shoot someone...its not the drugs or the guns or the parents or the society...no...the videogames are to blame. Man it must be awesome if you always know who is to blame.^^
19064,"The entry on Pokemon made me laugh, the others made me angry. A non profit organization and governments work together to prohibit adult rated video games to minors. Ok, doesn't bother me very much. It's just too darn bad that there are too many terrible parents out there. I BELIEVE that no child should ever be plucked in front of a screen for extended periods of time.
If someone wants to blame bad events like school shootings and New York muggings on video games, maybe they should volunteer to have their ability to reproduce removed. Three years after I was diagnosed with Autism, I saw and read about the incident that took place in Sandy Hook. After viewing the information, I deduced that my parents were infinitely better than the shooter's mother, who accidentally furnished the tools used to carry out the heinous acts. Gun control laws, curfews, mandatory education requirements, churches, after school programs... There is nothing that can compete with a broken mother."
19065,"Hatred should be #1 now. Like holy shit. Seriously look at some of that gameplay. I don't like it at all, but the controversy over it is stupid. The whole point of it is to turn people AWAY from killing by showing brutal scenes and psychologically disturbing gameplay."
19066,"They are fucking games, GET OVER IT!!!"
19067,"Well, how about God of war 1,2& 3? The game that i'm talking about is full of violence,murderer,sexuality,satanism,believing other gods, and more!"
19068,It's a shame because we have to suffer because 1 fucking idiot didn't like something and tries to ruin it for everyone else.
19069,fuckers these motherfuckers have no job other than pulling gamers leg
19070,"I call bullshit on the 6 days at fellajuah game.
It was going to be a ""fresh turd'. Same FPS, but with an actual story that people will know about and care about. Not the same ""RUSSIA IS BAD NATION DEY GOING 2 NUK U"" stuff. I would get pulling it off the shelves for not listing those who lost their life. But come the fuck on. They dropped it as soon as it was mentioned.
""You get to shoot innocents in an airport and its VERY REALISTIC."" Yes. Because you would totally sneak a light machine gun into an airport.
Yes because 4 people can take on millions of officers without a single scratch.
YES BECAUSE CoD IS REALISTIC"
19071,3:42 seth rogan ? lmao
19072,"So Watch Mojo is in agreement that the whole 'violent video games are evil' campaign is stupid and pointless. However, they DO in fact seem to believe that Resident Evil 5 was racist. I guess you guys are only half ignorant."
19073,wtf the no russian mission is my favourite.citizens not shooting back so i can kill them by hundreds.best thing ever
19074,"The russian airport massacre in COD Mw2... wow. :S
looked a little too real for a FPS."
19075,"my god people they are VIDEO GAMES. you have to have some sort of mental condition if u think that after playing a violent game, u can go and do the same thing irl."
19076,Idots only say video games make ppl kill
19077,You left out the best part of the Mass Effect controversy: Jack Thompson (of all people) thought people were making too big a deal out of that
19078,I don't mind opinions but do your damn research. lol
19079,Manhunt 2 scarred the shit outta me when I played the first time lol
19080,Civil war? Blame cod
19081,You can still buy the uncensored version of Manhunt 2 on Amazon in the US for the PC. Just bought it and downloaded it two weeks ago.
19082,"7:52
EVERY TIME a shooting happens the conservatives blame video games and the liberals blame guns.
It's stupid that they can't just blame the shooter's mental state or upbringing or maybe the shooter himself."
19083,I played MW2 and thinked i was a hero... i didnt understant english
19084,"People don't turn violent solely based on the type of video games they play, there has to be some more deep rooted issues. I mean sure, kids are impressionable. I used to watch a lot of wrestling as a kid. As a result, my friends and I would wrestle in the playground or back garden and sometimes it'd get out of hand. As a result, my parents would ban me from watching for a while. But think back, violence has existed since Neanderthals were able to swing a club. They didn't have violent movies or video games. They acted upon instinct. Over time, we as a race have learned that such actions have repercussions and to not always act upon certain urges. Some people are either too ill educated to know this or suffer from deep rooted mental issues that aren't dealt with sufficiently enough. Some people are just evil. My point is, there are many more reasons as to why acts of violence occur. Blaming video games is a cheap argument. If you believe that video games are gonna give your kids a bad impression, don't let them play them or better yet, talk to them and make sure they understand reality from fiction. There's a reason why these games have age ratings though. Trying to get them banned outright is an affront to free speech."
19085,"Lol I remember the no Russian mission. I was in the bathroom for the cut scene, so I was just like okay I'm in and airport, OKAY i guess were shooting the civilians lmao."
19086,"It's not just covered by conservative news (for #1).
Hell, my whole family is conservative as can be, and we all play MW2 & Bo1 on weekends. CNN actually had most the of the 'video game violence' bs on."
19087,"I am just letting people know that more people die falling out of bed in the last year than people dying of violent video games in the last 20 years. But that's none of my business. Let's ignore the guns that are used for these shootings. Guns should only be used for law enforcement and hunting. Guns should be banned except for those two reasons. People will always say they have the right to bear arms, but if you are afraid to go out in public without a gun on you, then that is a you problem. Do not go to those places if you are afraid unless you have a gun."
19088,What a bunch of bull shit those games don't provoke shit it's the people that do. And those veterans that died in war I respect them but that's shit. blame video games for shootings. Wow classic news and presidents
19089,Who believes in Fox News anyway lol
19090,The hoy coffee mod was anoying because rockstar didnt mean for it to come out but they get sued.
19091,"2 Words.Bull.Shit. Just because a game is violent dosent mean your going to be a killer. Ive been playing cod,GTA,assassins creed,battle feild etc since I was 5. The woman who was pissed when her son died was a bit to angry at the games yes her son died in that war but the game was ment to pay amage to the war not make fun of it. Peaple watch mass murde,gory and masked murder films all the time but they dont get bombarded by press for being violent. It should be up too the parents if there kid is allowed to play video games. some of the funniest and kindest peaple I know Ive played with on cod and battle feild for the last 3 years and have met them in real life hundred of times."
19092,"Adoption jokes? Look, Wheatley and GLaDOS are robots without emotion, they will insult you throughout the game like most negative characters. GLaDOS' only main objective is to make do a bunch of tests until she gets turn into a potato, Wheatley goes corrupt, typical robot things!! Yes poor Chell may have been abandoned but her parents might still care for her if they had known where she was for the last 999 years. But not to mention the fact that once you finally beat the game you get thrown out into the middle of no where and all you have left is the ol' Companion Cube to keep you company while you travel billions of miles of land trying to find a place to call home. So I might say Portal 2 is great and compelling game. Do not read if you don't like spoilers!!!"
19093,The No Russian mission was out of line indeed but other issues on this top ten pisses me off tbh. Stop blaming the problem of your country to games peanut-minded bitches
19094,I DONT BELIEVE THIS BULLSHIT STILL EXIST
19095,"What pussies thought Pokemon was satanic, or even promoting animal cruelty? What a bunch of prissy idiots."
19096,"Isn't blaming violent video games on murders kind of ridiculous? Why yes, many murderers play violent video games no doubt, but most gamers who play these violent games are not killers.
The same can be said for rapists. While the majority of rapists are men, most men, aren't rapists. Think about it."
19097,Old people is just jealous they didn't have videogames when they was young
19098,"I remember years ago watching the Behind the Scenes of the Resident Evil movie. Marilyn Manson, who composed the soundtrack, and he himself who has caused controversy, made a good point. He said that people blame video games for younger generations to do bad stuff but Bush was blowing up other countries and people acted like that wouldn't affect kids. Even though this was around 15 years ago that he said this, it still applies today even with a different president."
19099,"I'm 14 and I've been playing quite violent games for years and my music taste goes from Cat Stevens to thrash metal and death metal and I don't even know how to properly open a pocket knife, and I always avoid to be rude to people and try to be kind."
19100,I can't wait for the shitstorm when Hatred is released.
19101,That Fox News clip from Northridge was at the old Family Fun Arcade.
19102,living in Australia sucks if your a gamer
19103,What game is this one 3:15 ?
19104,"First one is first world problem, true story."
19105,"Ummm actually I can tell everyone here whom are not gamers that gamers like moi avoid real life responsibliities so we don't do them cos we get enough out of doing them that we don't need do of them in real life. Make sense? So if someone kills someone it's not because of video games it's just cos they are tapped, and videos are definitely not the blame."
19106,"Lol that lady is a bitch, now if you will excuse me I'm going to go laugh with my mates cos one of them just tore my head and spine of my body."
19107,Even though witches and state of decay ARE BANNED in Australia my mate and  I used to go to the eb games across the road and it somehow managed to get both throes game and other that where banned here
19108,So you are telling me that that aussie arsehole is the  reason why all the video games that my mates play in America can't be sent to me!?!?!? Like when they banned fallout cos it had drug use in it!!
19109,"Uh it had to be a feminist that has a go at the sex scenes, ""a man chooses the women that he wants to have sex with"" no shit that's the character you're playing, it wouldn't be any different if you played as a woman."
19110,"Video games are a form of art! Interactive, digital, art! Some tell stories, some have puzzels, somehave action, someallow exploration, some bring scares,and, of course, someshow violence. Like in movies, people put a lot of time, effort, and money into the elements of the game.So if someone says video games should not have violence, then you might as well remove it from movies and television shows as well. And if people wont allow violence to be removed from TV and movies, you cant do it to the gaming area, no matter what! And gamers like myself,will fight to defend it untilthe end, like Noble 6 in Halo Reach!"
19111,7:26 what is that game called ?
19112,Fucking nanny state australia. We miss out on a lot.
19113,FOX news everytime...
19114,Gosh can people just shut up video games are fake no gamers are going to rip off somebodies head with their bare hands
19115,So killing a crowd of people with a flamethrower/chainsaw whatever is fine but badly animated sex is not suitable for children? ...
19116,"I love how Fox News is on ever picking...fucking ignorant, illogical, single minded morons."
19117,french religeous groups claim halo and its fans are satanic
19118,It really pisses me off to see people always jump straight to video games like fps and mmos. When this kinda stuff happens it not the games fault.
19119,Video gamers don't get vilent and do video game vilent STUPID people do it I'm saying this for one reason and one resin only TO STOP PEOPLE FOR BLAMING VIDEO GAMES FROM VILANCE
19120,"JESUS CRIST STOP WHINNING ABOUT FUCKING VIDEO GAMES ITS NOT REAL AND WHY DO U CARE ABOUT YOU SENSITIVE FUCKS I MEAN DOES IT REALLY EFFECT YOU IN SOME WAY NO YAH I DIDNT THINK SO SO STFU ABOUT ALL THIS SHIT LIKE ""OHHH VIDEO GAMES ARE BAD FOR OUR CHILDREN"" ""OHHH THEY CAUSE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS"" OHHH THERE GONNA GROW UP AND DO IT IN REAL LIFE "" SHUT YOUR DUM ASS UP AND STOP WHINNING"
19121,"Oh so someone makes a game based on a battle in the Iraq War that killed many it's terrible, but Clint Eastwood gets a pass when creating a film doing the same thing but with less killing of Americans and more killing of civilians"
19122,"If Night Trap was about women killing men, no one would even speak of it! This just shows the amazing double standard for women when it comes to media."
19123,"watchmojo, what about the NFSMW controversy, allowing players, like me, to engage in road rage against the Rockport County Police?"
19124,"Played every single GTA and other gamesfor several years, haven't killed anyone yet, must be something wrong with me? oh right I'm not fucking insane."
19125,we should start a rebellion on people who blame video games and not mental probs
19126,"stupid parent, stupid congress"
19127,"Funny thing is, Manhunt was not about killing for fun. It had a story."
19128,"yea gouvernment and news guys be like:
""Let's ban every fun game as everything is offensive and disturbing even though it's Mario"""
19129,Stop bitchin about the GTA scene. They were doing it CLOTHED! CLOTHED!!!!! Imagine it on Next Gen consoles or PC!
19130,Every single game you mentioned that were 'banned in Australia' are all available in Australia...
19131,"Only conservative media exploits mass shootings and blames them on video games? Well, aren't we bias WatchMojo.com. ALL MEDIA DOES THAT! CONSERVATIVE OR LIBERAL!! There's more liberal media than there is conservative media here in the States and they do that even more than Fox News or any other conservative media. OPEN BOTH OF YOUR EYES! NOT JUST ONE!"
19132,The slots were just a minigame and they had to be taken out because people overreact! So now I don't get to hear the awesome music that comes with game corners or get special pokemon/TMs instead I get minesweeper (we don't even get this anymore...) or some sad dude who gives three dolls then has no other use... yaay
19133,There's a really fucking easy way to stop kids from playing violent video games: DON'T FUCKING BUY THEM FOR YOUR KIDS
19134,Notice a lot of this shit is coming from Fox News. Typical.
19135,"Boy, this reminds me how much people piss me off...."
19136,"These shootings only happen in the USA. Guess why... Because even a mad person can get a gun legally. Dont blame the games, put the blame on your sick law."
19137,"VIDEOS DOES NOT MAKE US FUCKING AGGRESSIVE!!! i am sicken tired of thsi stupid debate.....
just like playing monopoly won't make me rich gta won't make me a criminal
i won't become a doctor if i play that surgery game (which name i always forget) same with all other shooting games won't make me a killer -_-"
19138,"POINT #1........................................
You don't even mention the fact that you can CHOOSE from the start to be a woman.... I am a man who has never even played the game as a woman character and I know this... Come on.. That's a huge point you glossed over.."
19139,gta is banned from target and Kmart in Australia.
19140,"Its not the video games faults, but I won't deny that they do give kids ideas on killing people. However, If they were taught ANY morals in their young life, they should be fine. End of that discussion.
Now if im not mistaken, the reason most kids end up shooting people is because they get bullied. Or threatened. In that case. Its the bullies fault, and the rest of the people who didn't do anything about it when they knew it was happening."
19141,"i am surprised ""no rushin"" didn't make #1"
19142,1 should be gta because you can kill cops steel cars shoot peaple and just go around robing stors
19143,"So games to blame for people being idiots and not caring about life, fuck out of here, no shock a lot of fox news coverage blaming games."
19144,"Games are amezing cuz you can: fight, kill, distroy, torture, steel and stuf. So you don't have to do it in real life. And without hurting someone. And it can also be a great way to lose your anger."
19145,women are only valued by thier sexual desirablility.. 100% true.. what the fuck else do they have to offer? The answer is NOTHING!!! go f*ck yourselves. MGTOW.
19146,Why is it that everyone hated the Hot Coffee mod when it was CUT!?! They took it out! What's the deal? They decided not to do it! So why were parents outraged?
19147,On my opinion people who can controll their selves are free to play games. But people who go crazy after a game should stay with mario. People can't just blame games and say it's their fault. Once i saw on the tv that a boy saved a man by driving a car off the road after crashing and so preventing another one from crashing too. After that the i think 8 year old boy said he learned that from gta 5 and i was surprised. Just by playing a gmae he saved at least 2 lives including his own. So games can be bad but also can be usefull decide for yourself.
19148,"Ugh, media knows nothing. Fucking idiots."
19149,No 1 may be considered a controversy but it's certainly not true it's just coz there's ott soccer moms who bitch about video games bring to violent! Fuck you stay out of video games coz all you do is judge others for makin entertainment
19150,six days in falusha was a game to show war is hell like cod waw campaign
19151,Why is no Russian on there it gives you the choice to skip the mission
19152,"No Russian might mean: Do not kill any Russians, because as far as i played, the other NPCs didn't fire a single bullet against any Russian civilian"
19153,Why won't they blame the movies. I've played GTA V and you don't see me beating down people and killing them.
19154,Can you please do the top 10 shock sites?
19155,"IT""S........A........VIDEO GAME! THERE NOT REAL! SHUT UP STUPID NEWS!"
19156,"people will do anything to take the blame away from them being terrible parents. If anything videos allow you to release any pent up aggression or dark thoughts you may have with out hurting anyone. If parents took half the time to raise their kids as did making it then you would have any issues. This is just like what is going on with tide pods. kids ate them and got sick, and the parents said it was the company's fault because they look like candy. What doesn't look like candy to a child? And why was it in a child reach? The warning label says clear as day keep out of children reach, and you should be smart enough to know that's not candy. Yet people don't want to own up to their own failures and are quick to blame anything they can on why something went wrong."
19157,"So let me get this straight, 6 days in Fallujah, which tried to actually rely on factual events and information from veterans who were brought on board so it wouldn't be bullshit and wouldn't be offensive, gets canned because the of anti war activists and press, yet activision can have a mission in modern warfare 2 where you mow down an entire airport of people in a relatively realistic way that a mass shooting would go, and that's okay?
Not to mention the female host on the radio show was being such a smug cunt to the guy saying, ""Well you probably knew you'd get some blowback since some people lost their children"", yeah it's this kind of shit that makes me despise the media to no end, hey there's a mass shooting, let's blame videogames and guns, never mind that a someone who would do something like that will never obey laws set forth to prevent such action, and you can take guns away, but what's to say they won't use bricks, or pipes, or knives, or glass shards? Rant over."
19158,"Hhaha terrible. That woman about her son around 5m10. I'd hate to burst her bubble after 2 years but her son did have a choice.
Do I sign up or not? :-\"
19159,you are wrong about the mission in mw2
19160,If someone is so mentally unstable that they can be influenced by video games then they shouldn't play the games simple as that and as for the plonker who said Pokemon is satanic then I would love to see what he thinks about for instance mario kart
19161,"The lady at the end of the video knows best, more or less video game violence should be portrayed as a way to not commit violent acts and crime psh."
19162,"I hate how people always blame video games first. Most people who do that stuff already have violent intentions. They always blame video games, never other stuff. It pisses me off.."
19163,and thats why thare is a rate on the games
19164,"From what i see, Night Trap is the most popular game of all times, as it features in almost every other top 10 :P"
19165,"Everytime i play pokemon i say my satanic prayers first then do a ritual or two to, good old satan!"
19166,"This makes me sick. It really pisses me off when the media tries to blame the violence of today on video games. Everyone is responsible for their own actions, not games. A game can't make you shoot and kill people. Hell even real guns aren't dangerous...only as dangerous as the dumbass using it. A lot of those games were great like Doom, Mortal Kombat, Mass Effect, Manhunt, as well as others, but it's not our fault that the world is full of stupid people. Bottom line don't blame video games for the dumb ass people of today."
19167,i swear people on the news don't even know how to form rational statements.
19168,ew. fox news.
19169,another great example of why conservatives belong in a mental institution.
19170,god i hate fat adults who blame shit on video games and another thing most video games can actually teach u something useful in life
19171,Some of these games are very violent omg the last one was sick
19172,1:02 Those words from FOX news made me lose a few IQs.
19173,Faux News.....ah there all cunts....and insane of course.
19174,"Video games make you violent congress, republicans, and parents say. Sure ever since I started playing skate 3 I've always wanted to jump off of a building for a hall of meat challenge!"
19175,"its funny how fox news and other conservative media outlets are constantly complaining about how ""pc"" everyone is but they're the ones claiming about video games are causing the downfall of society without realizing how completely ridiculous that idea is."
19176,i wanted to slap that stupid bitch at 5:30 up on her high horse like she actually cares PFFF jump off a bridge. Spending all their time focusing on the fact that you die in the game...? like no shit...what? did they think the game was going to make fun of their deaths? because it seemed more like they were trying to pay them homage..people are such overly sensitive douchebags.
19177,"Two words: ""Fuckin' Liberals."""
19178,why is fighting zombies banned in Australia if they have to do it there in real life?
19179,"Most of these controversies are stupid af, people so sensitive and narrow minded."
19180,"Okay, mental issues don't make you want to kill people and nether do video game, I have mental issues and i play all kinds of video game, while they do give a darker humor to a person they don't make them killers, what makes them killers are piece of shit people who try to say their the issues of the world, because hate to tell you but several of the things your fuckers enjoy where made by outcast with some form of mental issue cause a social un-liking of them. But if you go around saying they are the entire issue guess what they will get so fucking sick of your people that the only answer to get rid of their hell is getting rid of you, so next fucking time try being nicer because do you even consider the hell people with mental issues deal with daily, from being forced to take meds that ruin there minds more, to being seen as the sin of their family, to being pushed so far to many times that the only fucking choice left for them is kill or be killed, trust me iv dealt with it, and trust me killing people has seemed like the best choice but you know something unlike you fuckers think even after being through hell we mental people still care for the world and the people in it, in fact you most likely couldn't find a better friend because when we make a friend we'd die to protect them, So to all you fucking Haters Go burn in hell-."
19181,"i feel as though the media just wants to get rid of video games, movies can be either just as/even more violent than many video games. What if someone had watched the movie casino before conducting in a mass shooting? Would the public then be obligated to ban all movies with violence in them? By the logic that ignorant media individuals have, we must get rid of ALL violent subjects such as: books, tv, paintings and Movies."
19182,"This really fucking pisses me off, all these cunts going over the top with the problems in these games, why the fuck.... im in AUS i still get all the banned games off the internet but what the fuck? they all have warning, in Kmart (store) GTA V was take off the shelves because it was not ""family friendly"" ITS FUCKING R18+ DON'T FUCKING BUY IT FOR YOU FUCKING KIDS IF IT IS THAT!!! POKEMON SATANIC???? WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK!?!?!?!?!!!??!??!?!?!??! FUUUUCK ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING?!??!!

19183,"For people who want Manhunt 2, it's on amazon digitally now."
19184,"If I were a successful game developer caught up in a controversy of my game, i.e. the mass effect romances, I would have so much fun with the media. Like just fucking with them for not doing their research.
If you're doing an interview or report, look at all the facts dumbass!"
19185,"Infinity ward knew exactly what they were doing with ""No Russian"" it was designed solely to be a middle finger to media."
19186,Notice how all these news clips are from Fox News.
19187,that whole blame 1rst person shooters is so stuped
19188,"I remember getting the email about my account getting hacked, what a miserable ordeal.. I was playing battle field and had a good squad of gamers with me, it was such a blast.. Pun intended."
19189,"It was on the news this morning and I was like Wtf , video game are too violent..... Why do they always have to blame something weather it be tv, films, comics , video games..... People are just fucked up and they can't see this!?!?"
19190,I hate people that blame all the violence and shootings on video games. A video game isn't making you go out into the real world and commit horrible acts. There is a BIG difference between simulated violence and real violence.
19191,"I lost my shit when he said ""Pokemon brings your child to a world of witchcraft"""
19192,What game was that from 3:25_ 3:30
19193,Shout out to my boy Stephen merchant.
19194,Y does Makorav say no Russian
19195,"I love living in the United States.A place where if a videogame is banned, then you know it's REALLY fucked up. I mean, come on, how many videogames actually get banned in the United States?"
19196,"i think some board games should be banned, after a game of monopoly i have a strong urge to assault everyone in the room."
19197,Those last few lines are bogus! you can't blame mental illness on video games!! That's a cop-out to ban video games! DONT LET THEM DO IT!!
19198,"they are all fake. and basiccly. they just, say random sh*t. ""oh but violint games are evil!"" Bitch! i played my first violint game when i was 8 years old! do i look like a violint killer?"
19199,So there are criminals shooting people but the media doesn't blame the fucking GUNS but the video games. WHAT IS THIS MADNESS
19200,My opinion is if someone is mentally unstable then a gamr like GTA might make them violent. But if someone is mentally healthy and they play GTA it wont make them violent.
19201,In general it just pisses me off that the media attacks not only video gamers but also video gamers who like to shoot real guns in real life. You know what...screw them all.
19202,This mass media people are soo idiots
19203,"No one here can say that they're not violent until they are placed in a situation where they have to defend themselves. When people are in danger, some people tend to lose their shit, or recall something they saw and try to do it in real life. I'm not against video games like these pricks in the media, but I'm just sayin. Put a person in a situation where they have to fight to survive, then you'll know what they're capable of."
19204,"I remember seeing the hot coffee mod controversy on the news and I was just thinking to myself, ""why the fuck do they care? It just looks like 2 cardboard boxes having sex""."
19205,they never actually played these games did they? One of em might even find one of these games are actually fun to play.
19206,if your stupid enough to believe that because you see something in a VIDEO GAME that means your should do it my opinion is that your should have video games taken away put your helmet on and go watch looney toons
19207,I hate both parties ... But man the stupid conservatives make the most out of these issues
19208,MY GAWD! Fox News is honestly the most ridiculous News Cast Organization EVER!
19209,I hate how they always say that it was ONLY VIDEOGAMES WHEN THEY ACTUALLY HAVE NOTHIN TO DO WITH IT
19210,"LOL you americans are awesome. A person murders a couple of others and the fault is on videogames. Hey, let me give you a hint: how about banning weapons? That's a good way to start!"
19211,"When I was a boy around the age of 12, my first ""violent"" game was ""The House of the Dead 2"". Although it is a Rated M video game, it was in arcades for anyone to use. No age limit. Parents were the only ones to decide if you were allowed to play. But my parents condoned the ""violence"" in the game because the graphics were not realistic as most video games. Nonetheless, it was fun. And I learned a lot about maturity.
Throughout the game of ""The House of the Dead 2"", there were certain moment in which a civilian is in dangered by a zombie and the player has a chance to rescue them. One of my parents advised me to forget about saving them. Reason being is because you have a set of Life Counters; if you shoot a civilian by mistake, you lose a life counter. And if you lose the game, you have to pay more money for credits to continue.
I got one did not think that was right. I decided to rescue continue rescuing the civilians, even though I sometimes accidentally made collateral damage on civilians. How I play video games is how I would act in that situation the character is in. Not for survival, but to save others as well as yourself.
At least that's just me. I just wanted to share my experience."
19212,i hate stupid feminists that think they know about everything
19213,games don't make us get angry lag dose
19214,"bah guns and mental illnesses dont kill people, video games do !"
19215,god that news lady in the six days in fallujah list was stupid i mean yes those people lost those lives those soldiers are heroes but we shouldn't let our enemies censor our entertainment
19216,If I get told by reporters people say that video games make us volient id flip um off on live tv
19217,"Played gta ever since I was a kid. I'd kill thousands of civilians and cops in that game. Spent countless hours on just making mayhem. And now my career is based off of law enforecement. Video games have no psychological effect, there just a digital paradise to unwind from the real world and have a little fun."
19218,"Eventually, if people keep complaining, games are just going to be running and jumping in mid air for no reason."
19219,Pokemon? haha what a bunch of idiots. Religion is responsible for millions of deaths.
19220,People are stupid and give me cancer -_-
19221,"While I believe that violent video games can play a part in the motives of mass shooters, I think the true problem is undiagnosed mental illness. I'm not a fan of overly-violent video games, and I honestly find the gta series depraved, but they aren't always the reason why we have these terrible tragedies. There are parents out there who refuse to accept that there may be some psychological issues in their child, even when the symptoms/behaviors are obvious. Children, teenagers, and adults who have any sort of untreated emotional or mental illness are subject to become outcasts in society, and this can lead to suicide or mass shootings  or both. Video games aren't the real problem, though parents should still monitor what their children play (and how much they play). I love video games, but there is such a thing as too much uwu"
19222,"Saying that violent games make people violent is like saying people are goats because they play goat simulator..
I hope some people in the media see my point here and stop this BS.."
19223,"Pokemon was accused of witchcraft? what century are we in? Whoever ranted off on that piece obviously is still living in his great great great grandpa's mind cuz witchcraft isnt really a thing to be concerned with now adays nor do we believe in it or fear it..... omg its promoting witchcraft... burn him at the stake.... seriously, some ppl need to wake up and see what century we are in and get a life!!"
19224,"I'm on and off with violent video games. Some aredecent but others go a bit too far.Yet I love how people are so quick to support games where you massacre tons of people and then when somebody seems just the slightest bit bothered by it, people tell them they re stupid, over sensitive, and need to go die. You could make a game where you molest and kill 5 year olds, slap the title ""Call of Duty"" or ""Grand Theft Auto"" on it and somepeople would stilldefend it. Although the pokemon one was downright hilarious."
19225,3:49 thailand!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
19226,These people r retarded ( not watch mojo or people in the comments.
19227,I watch violent movies and play violent games and I don't feel like killing people
19228,leave it to people nowadays you see a genuine problem but you coming to solution that has nothing to do with a problem. its not a parenting problem oh fucking no. its a video game problem. seriously you can't keep blaming everything on video games and movies
19229,"Ok, ""No Russian"" was offensive and controversial. But, if you pay attention to the objectives in the mission, it says ""Follow Makarov's lead"", not ""Kill civilians"". Also, you have the ability to choose to skip graphical/mature content in the setup of the game. If you chose to play the content you can still skip it, which makes it absolutely optional to play the mission."
19230,"people blame mass shootings on violent video game but the truth is that kids are taking out their shooting tendencies in video games instead of shouting someone they're inside safe, instead of joining a gang they're inside off the streets. If anything video games help keep shootings from happening."
19231,"When the narrator mentioned ""stupid"" in the beginning, and they showed Pokemon Black and Blue at that specific moment, I was so happy. :')"
19232,What if I told you that it's fake?
19233,I found with that mw2 level wen I played it I thought well if I skip this I just missed out on one of the best story's  in cod history
19234,"What pokemon.. Satanic. Animal abuse,i nvr understand US people."
19235,"news reporter:""video games are violent and needs to be shut down"" no they are just dumb and need to lern there just video games"
19236,This sounds kinda like Matt Pat
19237,"the one about pokemon kinda messed with me .I'm a christian and i play it, well used to, got kinda boring."
19238,"Yes sure games have negative effects, but that is all people focus on. They have lots of positive effects as well. Why does no one focus on those?"
19239,"Games Don't Make People Violent, Lag Does"
19240,what about spec ops the line white phosphorus scene
19241,Wow why do people hate cod because of a Russian war:
19242,So does this mean Big Game Hunter makes me a hunter because I've never shot an animal or gone hunting?
19243,wasnt six days being made partly in memory of the people who died in the real thing
19244,"Guy shoots someone, he once played a game and shot someone, well its obvious why he did it, video games."
19245,did you know that in Australia they now sell state of decay and saints of row 4
19246,"You really think, killers have time to play video games?  I mean at least try and see how that fits in their ""free time""."
19247,The only reason why video games cause violence is when the player thinks it's okay to do in real life. Maybe M-rated games should come with a warning that says never do whatever happens in real life.
19248,Grand Theft Auto warrants controversy
19249,"Who is that ""certain advocate"" in florida that they are talking about?"
19250,"A man can play CoD or Battlefield and be influenced to join his army and serve his country. Someone may play Assassins Creed, and perhaps they'll take up parkour. Videogames are inspiring, rather than harmful. They can also provide an outlet to channel one's rage, instead of real life. So, video games cause kids to randomly start shooting people? Bullshit."
19251,"lol notice how FOX is the source that shows up the most, with the dumbest fucking reasons."
19252,What upsets me? Hmmmmmmmmmmm Everything concerning Anita Sarkesian.
19253,"Although the supposed link between psychopathic gun violence and violent video games is ludicrous, I do think that some of these games (Call of Duty and games like it in particular) deaden some of us to the true horrors of war and combat. In real life, you can't take 20 bullets before you die. You can't take over a military base by yourself. And you sure as hell don't spawn into a new body 20 seconds after you take a bullet between your ears. I fear that these games don't do justice to the sheer moral abomination that war really is.
I'm not saying we shouldn't play them; I'm certainly not advocating a ban on them like that blowhard Jack Thompson. What I am saying is that we need to be cognizant of the fact that these games are caricatures. We need to introduce more anti-war elements into these games -- they too often seem to glorify combat and have the same black and white view of morality that has characterized the US for years, most recently incarnated in Bush and Co. through their imperialist crusade in Iraq which cost thousands of lives and billions if not trillions of dollars. We need to make shooting games horror games as well, because that's what real war is. And we need to keep them out of the hands of younger children, not because they'll turn them into little Adam Lanzas (for we know they won't) but because they may give those who aren't intellectually mature enough ideas about war which aren't healthy for a 21st century society to hold.
I'm not anti-video games, I quite like them. I even play COD occasionally when my friends are over, since they love it. But I am fiercely anti-war and I think we need to scrutinize those games that treat the deaths of human beings as points on a scoreboard. We shouldn't get rid of them, but we need to bring to them the proper mindset and a mature understanding of the complex situations they attempt to portray. Which is why I don't think 10 year olds should be playing them.
P.S. One game that I LOVE which does this perfectly is Spec Ops: The Line. It's a great FPS which also faithfully portrays (at least to the extent that a video game can) how horrible war is for the people who have to fight it, and the blurring of moral lines inherent in the practice of killing other human beings, no matter the reason."
19254,Fuck fox news.
19255,Omg games don't ruin ur mind and stuff seriously
19256,I'd like to comment on number 6 saying that those games are no longer banned in australia.
19257,"guess what? if you're in aus and games are banned, you can go to steam main page, do /?cc=us and all games will be allowed for purchase :)"
19258,"I'm going to be honest. I did a presentation on why video games don't cause violence. And my question is, what about music or movies or tv? If video games are do bad, what about Skyfall, or Bullet by Hollywood Undead? Skyfall yeah it's based on a fictional character but come on, so many people get shot up by one man. Bullet is about killing yourself. Flat out I love that song but I don't wanna kill myself. If you're going to blame one source, you better blame the rest or just shut it. And let's not forget most shooting are cause by mental illness or long term bulling or problems at home. I didn't say all. I said most. No one ever seems to care about whatever else happens inside that persons life if they played a shooting game. ""He killed 10 people? Oh he must have played call of duty."" No you idiots he was bullied at school and had problems at home. Please people, just fully look instead of just blaming it on the first thing that comes to mind.
I made this statement not trying to insult or say fuck you to any group or people. I would love comments if you disagree or if you do agree."
19259,The only sure things in life are death and taxes. And annoying people complaining about them. I'd prefer the former over the latter.
19260,"Rated MR for MENTALLY RETARDED
P.S. Fuck Fallujah"
19261,"I have nothing against America really, but in saying that, the American press is fucking stupid if the are going to blame games for mass shootings. How bout you get rid of the guns in which are used to do so. Realize it's not the right thing for fuck sake"
19262,Mass effect really ?! Guess they have never heard of sexy beach or rapelay
19263,"They speak about violence in gaming, this journalists in tv, why they dont speak about violence in movies?( I love movies and games)"
19264,Bitch Bitch Bitch... all these international and law makers do is bitch...
19265,"I got halfway down the page before I realised I was deep in the Youtube comments section again. This is getting dangerous, people get angry down there."
19266,3:26 What's the name of this game?
19267,"Notice that LITERALLY EVERY news clip showing protest of these games is from FOX? Im not bashing conservatism (although you are mostly all annoying pricks) but FOX's news reports are almost all insane, and basically propaganda. Idiots control the media especially FOX I swear..."
19268,"The thing that makes me laugh about video game controversy, is the fact that most of these news reporters have never played video games."
19269,5:20 what a cunt.
19270,Many lost their children in WWII yetsaving private Ryan came out.... wtf people.
19271,"It's so funny to see in every case of video games controversy, covered by the news, it's always Fox News !
- if there is any controversial that is not covered by Fox News, the game should not be played.. instead let's play all the games that Fox News thinks is controversial, just to prove that there is nothing wrong with them and that Fox News is the real problem..
Seriously, from now on I will not use any ordinary game related media, to tell which game is should play.. I will check Fox News, to see the games they think should be forbidden and then go out and buy them instantly, so I can support those who fights against Fox News (not because I think they should be banned, but simply to prove that we are a bunch of people, that have made it out life mission to fight them with everything we got) !
Anarchy in the USA !"
19272,"90% of these news reporters have never actually played the video game there talking about. So maybe if you handed someone a ""violent""  video game and the then realise that they don't want to start shooting everybody they would talk about it differently."
19273,"Speaking of my consumption of violent media.......I can be comfortable watching violent films or listening to violent music. Some anyway. I won't go into how I distinguish between ""good violence"" and ""bad violence"" in the media. When it comes to video games though, I think violence is on another level because video games are far more participatory than film or music.
Overall I think that game makers should not simply deny all responsibility. Their games have to reshape society in a tiny way, be it for good or bad. If you admit that games effect people then you can take a little credit for the good they do, but you also have to take a little blame when they appear to do bad. I'm confident that there are conscientious game makers around and I don't expect that they should get it right all the time."
19274,"I love how a majority of these are mostly Fox News talking about how ""Controversial"" these games are"
19275,The freakin' box tells u want's included in the game and the age rating is on the front. If people are gonna bitch about DONT BUY THE FREAKIN' GAME!!! IT QUITE CLEARLY STATES ON THE FRONT COVER/ADVERT WHAT IS INCLUDED!!!!
19276,"5:17 that news reporter is a dick.
Yeah, let's not make movies about D-Day either because some people lost their children in that battle ;)"
19277,"I especially find the controversy that surrounded Manhunt 2 to be unfounded. They even went as far as to push the AO rating on the PC port five years after it's release when far more violent games had been released.
It also sounded like the narrarator hadn't even played the game (or its predecessor), because he sounded off on base judgements that everyone seems to have before actually playing it. The story has the main protagonist being hunted down while he's searching the individuals responsible for taking his family away from him. The people that he kills, are not innocent people (same goes for the first game).
Graphic, yes. But not any worse than other games released today that involve killing people to get to the end goal."
19278,"Anyone else think it's peculiar how graphic violence does not have to be censored as much as sexual content in the U.S.?
Although I'd prefer my kid siblings not to see any of that stuff, I'd consider blood, gore, maiming, slaughtering, etc. much more disturbing than a silly bare nipple or even genitalia."
19279,"Doom was considered satanic by some religious people?! Geesh, you are a guy who KILLS demons. How the f@ck is that satanic? LOL As for the rest - ridiculous. Did I enjoy playing Doom, GTA, Carmageddon, CoD Modern Warfare etc.? Hell yeah! Do I want to buy a gun and start shooting real people in real life? Hell no! I was like in 2nd or 3rd grade when I first go my hands on Doom and than on Blood. Sure, I had some sleepless moments after that and was scared to walk down the dark corridor to take a piss but that was it. LOL I recommend those political buffoons to re-evaluate all the sh@t they are doing on a daily basis like selling guns that are not only used by real terrorists to kill innocent people but even kill the very people those politicians are sworn to represent. It will be indeed a glorious day when people around the world want to be violent ONLY in video games and not real life. Men need to blow off some steam from time to time. Otherwise those dark thoughts and frustration may and probably will become real actions against other living people or animals."
19280,Pretty sure people were crazy before video games
19281,I'm gonna howl at the sun. Videogames made me do it. AAWRRROOOOOOOO!
19282,You can also play as a Women in all Mass Effect Games and have Sex with a man or even another woman or an Alien^^... so why the hell this Game should be sexiest ???
19283,"Most of these were stupid, but I kind of understood the MW2 mission. Kind of."
19284,I think its funny how very one forgets How Postal 1 and 2 were so violent. Hmmm lest see. And the mental illness is also a factor. I just don't get it.
19285,Americans... Are all fo them that dumb?? retard country!! better to remind myself to never go there!! might get infected
19286,"IDIOTS NO MORE NEWS NOMORE B** A** PEOPLE JUST LEAVE US ALONE LET US GAME IN PEACE!!!
Thx"
19287,America ruined everything and don't have a clue what there doing blaming games for people shooting and not the fact that people can legally own their own guns
19288,If any of those games where banned in America I would suicide
19289,One thing that shows the bullshit is how Fox news network and conservatives who support them are so against video games that violence or adult content when the game has a 17+older rating and yet they blame video games for violence in society. Yet when people say lets take a look at the right to bare arms(not ban them just limit them) they support the shit out of that and claim freedom and rights. But isnt video games under freedom of expression. Lets not be hypocritical FOX
19290,"I'm conservative, but still hate Fox News for these reasons."
19291,I agree a video game is recreating something terrible that happened like a movie that you can altor to your will or some reality that doesn't exist and if someone is crazy enough to shoot other people for fun thats messed up its not like the game makes them crazy or helps them think of ways to attack a school or something if anything scary movies help them think of a plan its just that video games are always the first to blame.
19292,"My only standpoint for GTA is this: DON'T LET YOUR FUCKING TEN-YEAR-OLDS PLAY IT. If a kid at the most impressionable age of his life is playing violent or scary shit all day every day, they're going to have some issues."
19293,good videos
19294,What game is shown at 3:16?
19295,THE... FACKING... PRESS
19296,Sorry typo I ment congress
19297,Screw ESRB and MPAA SCREW EM THEY SUCK A LOAD OF D AND FOX NEWS AND CONGRES
19298,I'm sorry but does the press think that by playing violent games automatically makes you a phsycopath? I play violent games but I'm not planning on going out and killing people!
19299,Kiiimmmm!!
19300,Also were is Lucius it is a super funny game with glitches (I saw it on CinnamonToastKen's channel) but I feel like Jesus freaks(which I'm not) would say it promotes satanism
19301,God I want to play video games but my dad says I have enough things but my mom says she will think about because my 12th birthday is in summer
19302,"' My son died in a war, therefore this game shouldn't exist ''...........
I am sorry for the loss of your son, but please. Would you kindly just fuck off?"
19303,"People who bash video game, movie, and TV for real life violence are among the stupidest I've ever seen. For fuck's sake, they're meant to be escapist fantasies. Are we killing each other any more than we did before video games,an entertainment popular in our homesformerely less than 50 years. You're just desperate to point your finger somewhere other than your own filthy mind. Or you find it easy to sway ignorant minds against video games to make yourself important, because non-gamers understandably don't get it at all, and some are just arrogant enough to judge others for enjoying things he doesn't. Entertainment isn't to blame any more than noose is for a suicidal person, it is, like every other loud issue, the stupidity we display as a species, emphasized by some of our worst, that isthe true culprit."
19304,People and the media need to stop blaming mass shootings on video games. There are a lot of people who play violent video games and don't do mass shootings. If video games do cause mass shootings then wouldn't almost anyone who played those games be violent? The reason why there are mass shootings is because of lack of education and gun control. We won't get anywhere if we investigate on these toys.
19305,"I'm starting to like these Top 10 lists, thanks Mojo. :-)"
19306,The people who panned Mass Effect for their sex scenes are full of shit and don't even know what the fuck they are talking about. In ME all characters including the female ones have depth and are definitely not just sex objects. Secondly in Mass Effect you can play as a woman banging a man as well. Thirdly as the speaker said the cutscenes only last for like a minute and would bore your grandmother. It amazes me how prejudice some idiots are when judging video games they haven't even played. Ugh -___-
19307,"People get killed from a psycho? BLAME VIDEOGAMES!
Seriously? You either are a mass-killing psycho or not. It's psychology. Video games never altered anything in anyone ever? OUT OF THE PICTURE, BLAME VIDEOGAMES BECAUSE MY SON IS ADDICTED!!!
Gr8 logic, FOX NEWS. Gr8 logic."
19308,"It is only mentioned as a passing remark but it really is fucked up that the media, especially conservative media, sees fake guns as a problem but not real guns. It is one of those things that just blows my mind, some people really don't understand how to think through their positions and avoid contradictions, I guess some people don't mind being intellectually dishonest."
19309,"So according to (mainly) conservative media someone who went on a mass shooting played video games so we must ban video games... Interesting. Well Anders Breivik went on a mass killing spree after listening to conservative media and christians so lets ban them too. Hell, Breivik actually indicates they were his reasons for doing that unlike the baseless speculation about video games."
19310,why dont ppl thing about ww2 ._.
19311,6:00 is fucked up
19312,Sexbox lol
19313,LOL GTA you tried to make a hentai and a murder fest. interesting O-o
19314,haha he said skate of decay
19315,Interesting to see how american concervatives eager to be idiots.
19316,5:10 So this game gets under fire by a shitload of Anti-War activists but Call of Duty stays on the market? Damn that is a stupid descision.
19317,Crime rate has actually gone down sice gta was released.  Also I'm pretty shore there's a reason why you can't access the sex thing gta San Andreas
19318,"I don't think that violent video games will cause an individual to go outside with a gun and commit a genocide. If they do, it is predetermined and they were crazy enough to do that before they played the game. I have played all the Grand Theft Auto games and I'll be honest, I love them. But do they make me do crazy shit in real life? OF COURSE NOT! I don't think Ive ever hit anyone before intentionally"
19319,"Oh sure, they can make videos based off of the Civil War, Vietnam, and WWII but they can't make a video game based off of the Battle of Fallujah?"
19320,People against video games are just frickin stay at home momes that has those kids that would tell on you for cheating on you.
19321,"first of all, people kill people...you know brains XD, secondly, how does video games cause violence, it isn't real...it's fake, it doesn't even feel real, even if you were messed up you would still be able to tell from a video game to real life. The only thing video games cause is addiction to the game where you play it everyday, nonetheless you should still keep track of time to take a break. In fact i make games and i know exactly how the games industry feels from all of this, it is wrong to blame an industry... Also Aaron Lewis (from Staind) had a mother approach him and asked why her son killed himself... Why would you go to the guy or industry and ask questions, only that person will know why, because people kill people and people kill themselves. It is what goes through the mind of the person that would make them do that."
19322,people are just fucking hypocrites YOU TOO AUSRALIA. why people can write books movies documentaries about war but whenever someone makes video game you get all fucking butthurt.
19323,"Hey world mad at video games, guess what?
It's a video game."
19324,Wtf is the noise that guy makes in the battle of fallujah interview
19325,of course it's always on fox news
19326,This PETA thing is pissing me out with all of their bullshit
19327,Funny how most people who criticize these games have never played them...
19328,Why do you hold shooting games to one standard and sports games not to the same? So you're saying if I play too many shooting games that I will go shoot my school. So if I make it to the majors on MLB Road to the Show I wont be guaranteed to go there in real life? Why are shooting games held to different standards? Because in America there is a biased news media and are full of idiots. We need to fix that
19329,I kill in video games so I don't have to kill in real life.
19330,"The NRA have so much to answer for in the US. They can keep saying it is within a human's right and in the constitution etc etc, but if you allow people to purchase guns freely (and in many cases, very easily), there will inevitably be killings. Also, we frequently hear about accidental deaths due to gun fire in the US - if you don't have a gun, that CANNOT happen.
If you look hard enough, you can always find something to blame for a shooting - everyone has read/played/watched something violent at some time in their life, but that doesn't make them go out and start killing people; generally there are A LOT of underlying issues to blame... Mental illness / severe bullying / family issues, to name but a few.
Look at almost every country where guns are illegal; the number of gun-related injuries and killings are virtually non-existent. It really isn't rocket science."
19331,"its funny how they blamed it on the games
its the player's fault if only the players were not imbeciles and retarded they wouldnt applied what they played to real life"
19332,Asaaaaa
19333,"I don't get why people don't understand that its a video game. you know how your parents always told you not to get mad over a game growing up. To make bad decisions in real life is a conscious decision, being addicted to video games has absolutely nothing to do with it."
19334,"I don't know why people don't like some of these games are pretty much real events that happen are biographies,like some movies,but in games it's pretty much just play the movies."
19335,The only common factor here? Fox news of course
19336,I think that casual gamers and people who don't play video games should have no say in what is put out in gaming.
19337,Can we all agree that the real problem is Fox News.
19338,"People just need to stay in their age group. 8 year olds shouldnt be playing Grand Theft Auto or Mass Effect. Games dont mentally harm people who are the appropriate age to understand and watch them, but if a kid grows up playing inappropriate games, then his young mind will be shaped trying to understand and recreate it. That Slender man thing that happened when those two girls tried to sacrifice their friend to Slender Man was a pretty big example. Even if they didnt get it from the games, they had been exposed to it before they were mentally ready. If people play the games rated for them then we wont lose video game rights."
19339,"I've been an avid gamer for a long time. I remember when games like Doom and Quake came out. I have to say, the thing I hate the most is when the news attacks games as if that was the only catalyst in shootings. There are a lot of factors when it comes to any kind of crime and you can't ever single out Doom or Call of Duty for a ""crime spree."" I do have to say, I've never been a fan of the Grand Theft Auto series, and I don't like the way that Rockstar Handled the whole ""Hot Coffee Mod."" My objection doesn't come from the fact that the content is included, but rather that Rockstar lied about it initially and once they got busted, they didn't handle the situation well. I have actually played some of the Grand Theft Auto games and I don't like them. That doesn't mean I think they should be banned though. The thing is, as consumers if people don't like a game that comes out, just don't buy it. Also why is it that there are young kids playing CoD or other violent video games; where's the parents?"
19340,Let's ban the guns that should work let's ban the games that should work nope still don't work not now not ever quit blaming on the inanimate object and target the people idipts
19341,Did you see all were fox news clips so #F#@K FOX NEWS
19342,"I think what pisses me off the most is that the media always pulls out ""Scientists have stated that violent video games can translate to real life violence."" B.S. but i don't give a damn what the scientists say because they are the people who sit around stating things just so they can feel like their opinion is more important than mine."
19343,Ignorance will never go away!
19344,the most violent people dont play video games
19345,"I argue this point every time something like this comes up, and I will continue to until I die. But, the problem is, they don't care. The people want something to blame, and video games are their scapegoat. We can't fix ignorance and stupidity, but we can sure fight it whenever it arises. All I have to say is, I've played video games since I was 3, and I haven't killed anyone or began worshipping satanic rituals because of pokemon."
19346,"Show hyper realistic blood and organs in a movie - I don't see any problem here.
Show pixelated blood in a 16-bit game -
Video games make murderers"
19347,"Fun fact for the religious people: (catholics) The beloved Pope John Paul II actually blessed pokemon ""because they encourage friendship"""
19348,Fuck the news people. Leave our video game community alone. You have no actual proof. Just assumptions. Jackasses
19349,"The funny thing is that violence has gone down in the US and 18 rated game sales have gone up. Which means games actually help stop violence, not create it."
19350,Wait a minute if a mass shooting happend before video games lets play the blame game and blame the news because people want to be on the news now if you exuse me i will go and blame the news for all my probloms hey news i play gta all the time and iv never shot someone whos is realy to blame NEWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Gamers will rise
19351,"Screw the press its not like someones going to play GTA and then go shoot someone.
and pokemon if they have a problom with animal abuse but then thay make a game about it if you one tell them this SCREW YOU"
19352,"also, if violent video games really did cause violence, there would be a lot more crime considering how many people play games like first-person shooters, mortal kombat, gta, and others like them"
19353,ya'll know that you have the option to NOT shoot civilians in the No Russian mission right? that's what should have been said to the people bitching about it when it came out
19354,Fox news pls. Get ur shit together
19355,"Vlliger Bldsinn was die Medien erzhlen, von solchen Spielen wird man nicht zwingend zum Mrder.
Die Menschen die andere umbringen oder Terroristen sind, sind in einem interessanten Umfeld gro geworden (mit interessant meine ich ""krank""), so dass die Psyche so angegriffen oder verkorkst ist, das manche Personen sowas tun, sei es aus Frust, Rache, Wut, Kummer, Beeinflussung oder hnlichem...
Fakt ist, dass Videospiele nicht daran Schuld sind an diesen Dilemar, es ist eher die Psyche des betroffenden und ihre Sicht der Realitt.
Also was soll das Ganze?!"
19356,"the pokemon thing was completely ridiculous to me. ""witchcraft"" pfft, die"
19357,"The news story that has undoubtedly pissed me off the most has to be the one about the two twelve year old girls that attempted to stab their friend to death for slender man. First off, I expected the news to try and find a scapegoat as usual for this, which they did, what I didn't expect however was how incredibly easily parents and politicians and others would believe them. Not only were a couple of creepypasta sites I followed shut down, many others had age restrictions and whatnot put on them. It just infuriates me to see how easily people are manipulated and how they look for a excuse in situations like these where it's plain to see that someone is just unstable. Those girls were not mentally healthy and therefore it was just a matter of time till something set them off. Unfortunately it just happened to be something that could be slightly controversial. Now if the reason the girls had killed someone is because they saw footage of someone attacking someone on a news channel then you better believe that they would not be blaming themselves."
19358,Fuck Fox News....
19359,Pokmon? Satanic?! Bull!
19360,"There was a fertilizer bombing, why don't we ban fertilizer?"
19361,absolutely NO personal accountability anymore. yup. lets all just be government sheeple. baaaa baaaaaaa
19362,You know religion promotes much more violence than video games right? Why not ban religion?
19363,Resident evil 5 was a good one
19364,And this is why I find Fox News to be bullshit
19365,7:37 BULLSHIT ALLERT
19366,people need to stop being so damn sensitive and let gamers do what they want with games. Its stupid and its a waste of time to blame a game for what a dumb ass does in real life.
19367,"People are so fucking stupid in this world. You have a problem with a game. Don't play it, don't even listen to anything about it. People take offence to games, that they consider having some kind of connection too, Whether you're son fought and died . Don't complain about a game, that has no connection to the son. Except for shooting people. Like every. Fucking. Game."
19368,"What Pissed Me Off Was The Gta series. Reasons: Torture, Coffee Mod, Getting Drunk and Blackout( If Drank 7 Beers), Strippers, Extreme Blood And Gore, Giving Weapons Skins, Spending Money On Cars Wastin' them On Strip Clubs, And Worst of Them All Robbing Banks And Stores."
19369,"I have to say that the Australian bans are bullshit, as soon as I heard that SR4 was being delayed for 'censoring' I went and purchased the uncensored version from another country and got it mailed to me, I had it a month before it was released in stores, and the controversial mission? 3-4 minutes of tripped out, drug induced psychosis, not without side effects though, which is what the government said was the problem (lack of side effects), I did it and I was scratching my head saying ""they banned it because of THAT? Really?"""
19370,Fox news is trash.. lets be honest there the kid in the corner for being too loud and obnoxious so Don't listen to the cry baby news.
19371,People just need to grow some damn balls.
19372,I have never seen a video game charged for murder' I have never seen a knife charged with murder but I have seen people charged with murder remember if they don't have guns they'd use somthing else
19373,"Do yourself a favor and read the book ""On Killing"" by Lt. Col. David Grossman and then come back and tell me about how video games have absolutely no impact on violence in society."
19374,Fox News :D
19375,"They did know you could also be a woman, and that women NPC's had the same abilities as you, and kicked just as much ass as the other NPC's, right?"
19376,"i got no problem with video game violence (blood and glory!!!). heck ill admit that ive gone on a random rampage on the only GTA ive owned just to see how long i could survive. but the one about the fallujah game is down right BS. immitate the camo and guns, and make grunts and blood splatters as realistic as you want, but making a game directly from a recent real life battle is an asshole thing to do. respect...show some."
19377,"Do you know what's funny? These news people don't know a thing about what they're talking about.  They just don't realize, ITS A F***ING VIDEO GAME, GET OVER IT!!!  Call of Duty has an M rating on it, but that doesn't stop little children from purchasing it.  Like the CoD No Russian scene, you're supposed to get over the fact that you were a terrorist, you're supposed to be mature about it, unlike the news.  They've got to stop being tight-asses and realize it's just a video game.  This also includes the Congress.  This might be my last message since they've probably started sending troops to my home to ""take me out"".  If they do, it just proves that they can't be mature about a video game title."
19378,i may seem like a heartless guy when i say this but the game on number 4 should been finished if they were worried about the blacklash they were going to get then y arent people who got all butt hurt over battle of falujih i think i spelt that right but anyways y dont they say anything about these other fps games im not saying i want them to im just saying
19379,I got pretty pissed off about call of duty and 1st person shooters
19380,It's always the right wing fear mongering as they normally due.
19381,I'd say the one about Anita Sarkeesian. It just baffles me why the media glorifies her and doesn't think that she's dishonest or manipulative.
19382,"This is my opinion on the last part, and I'm open to disscussion about it. I don't think it was BO2's fault. Now, would it have helped him possibly not do that, I'm not saying that. But I believe it was the parent's fault, she let him know where the guns were, what the combination was, and she took him to firing ranges (While knowing he was mentally unstable). Now, in saying that, i don't think that because he was mentally unstable that his parent(s) should have let him play that game in general. But those games can do nothing to someone who is mentally healthy. I for one loved that game."
19383,"Three words: ""Fuck the News"""
19384,"The funny thing to me is, they speak like these things are happening in real life, even though they constantly, when speaking about it, mention that they are in fact games. I was playing Streets of Rage and Mortal Kombat on the megadrive/genesis when I was 4 or 5, I've never killed anyone. People will always look to blame anything and everything as long as they don't blame the person that committed the crime."
19385,It's funny that someone from Fox News would complain about women being undervalued. XD
19386,You can have sex with WOMEN in your video game?! MIIIISOOOOOGGGGGGYYYNNNNNYYY
19387,Am I the only one that thought the Modern Warfare 2 one should have been higher?
19388,All friggin Call of Duty concrevercies.
19389,Mostly everyone in the whole world have played a video game once and every gam e 10+ and up have atleast a fight scene or something in it but it does not mean that the crimes were based on it unless the person who committed the crime admits it.
19390,Fuck the people who make these controversies. IT'S JUST A GAME.
19391,"6:21 did he reaaly say REALISTIC? holy shit, he haven't ever played that gane himself and haven't ever seen those awful fov, effects, animations.... In no way realistic"
19392,i think the game hatred(an unfinished game)also counts because its basiclly a guy shooting innocent people and he says i hate the world n in real life there are shoot outs like columbine massacre n etc. (idk much of massacres)
19393,"You don't become a terrorist by playing MW2. You can go through the entire mission harming no civilians, or skip it outright. Your only real enemy is the FSB that arrives later on the mission. The mission is key in the plot, and it isn't there to subvert a (rather) normal human being into a soulless killing machine.
But then again, name me one yankee news station that has (actually) done its research before throwing mouthfuls of hate and christianity into the matter..."
19394,minute 4.20 how come i haven't seen that part on GTAnow i'm gonna play it to discover it :D thank's for the video XD
19395,"Quote from a retard ""and it is very realistic"" well i guess i have been playing a different call of duty :P"
19396,"4:52 So because of the news we can't have this game. However we can have CoD World At War which retells ALL of world war two. Can someone please help me figure this out?
By the way, I am sorry to say this but I would have liked six days in fallujah"
19397,Football games didnt make me an NFL pro. Surgeon simulator didnt make me a doctor. Fucking nintendogs didnt make me a puppy whisperer! How come gta makes me a mass murderer!
19398,Lack of self control is always blamed on something else. I remember that episode from South Park where rich men say they are unfaithful to their wives because of some sickness from an alien wizard (obviously bogus). All these fucking hypocrites should watch it.
19399,"Ya, just like they blamed on marilyn manson for the coloumbine massacre back in '99. 
Funny fact was that the killers didn't even listen to him.
Oh it's so easy to blame it on someone else instead of taking our own responsability for what goes wrong!"
19400,And guess what?! GTA V was the #1 bought fucking game... EVER! Fuck the media
19401,Fox being a liberal ass. Go figure.
19402,"1:09 Am I the only one, who turned around to see who said THAT?"
19403,"Yes, school shooters tend to play video games, but that has nothing to with what they did. They don't play video games BECAUSE they're psychopaths, they play video games AND are psychopaths, there's a huge difference"
19404,People who talk about shit like GTA being violent and ME sex scenes as controversies need to stfu
19405,I dont realy give a fuck there are a lot of secure pirate sites where viruses are minimal to nonexistent and i can donwload whatever game THE FUCK I WANT with no fee charge all dlc's and other shit i only have to wait 3-4 days after game release and there i have it brand new game i can play multiplayer with a cracked multiplayer and other stuff.So fuck the media fuck the federals fuck everymuthafucking censored shit and stuff.stuff is updated regulary so no problems with most things
19406,"Manhunt 1 was really good tho! I loved that game.... ""Here piggy piggy""!"
19407,Hey fox news we already had mass shootings before videogames existed
19408,"Uhhh State of Decay is sold in Australia, but yeah, we have mad censorship"
19409,"media is media, they are idiots. as are congress men who dont want people to have fun. if you put on those glasses from movie They live, the signs are saying 'no fun allowed'"
19410,"your kidding me, violent shooters DO NOT cause violence in fact violent shooters actually REDUSE FROM STRESS AND EAVEN THOUGHTS OF MURDER! how many scientific test have to be proven to make society know this! This frustrates me to the max when I hear bull crap like this."
19411,"Alternate title:
Top 10 twats who don't know what they're talking about."
19412,"I played it as a kid with my brother and a cousin who owned it... oddly enough, it seems like no one thought much of it since we played it many times. and I get in trouble for way milder stuff...
the whole Jinx hoopla was ridiculous... looked better with black than purple.
I never understood why video games get all the flack for mass shootings. Nobody ever thinks about the mental stability of the person... like what are the chances that a stable person is going to turn around and go on a killing rampage?"
19413,Cool.
19414,Postal not mentioned once?
19415,"If video games make you kill then spoons make you fat, couches make you lazy, and windows make you want to jump out of them."
19416,what was with the news reporters voce at he end? .-.
19417,"These games are fun. I can play them and then distinguish between right and wrong because I know I'm playing A GAME. A psycho is a psycho because he likes to hurt, not because he played the game."
19418,"I remember there was a story on the news where a very young kid shot his grandmother after playing gta 4 and of course they tried to blame the video game. My thoughts are......
1. Why did the kid have access to the gun.
2. Games have ratings for a reason.
3. Shouldn't his grandma be watching over the kid.
To be honest I just think the government would do anything to get themselves out of trouble since in some countries people are allowed to carry a gun just anywhere."
19419,The govt always blames the entertainment industry specifically the video games and violent television and movies for all of society's ills yet when you turn on the news what do you see reports about rape and murder and war child abuse and children getting mauled to death by dogs and that's just the morning show at least the entertainment we all enjoy is fake the violence we all watch on the news is real the blood on the news is real you tell me which is worse you tell me which one would drive someone to commit savage acts against humanity the fictional world of entertainment or the real blood stained world of the daily news ?
19420,"I don't hate to say this at all but Ilove games where the player must go on mass killing sprees! Maybe If Call OfDookie had kind of stuck to the Modern Warfare 2 formula, the rest of the games that followed in the series wouldn't be a bunch of mindless ""let's kill the infinite waves of baddies"" shooters. It's still pretty mindless but at least it was the only alright one that I played. The airport scene was killer as well! Lol! I made sure to get every single person in that airport and I don't know why.
 Also, just to show how mindless the media actually is, they only go for the games that get the most publicity. There are a lot more games that are worse than a few romance scenes and killing people at an airport. What about Dead Space and the Necromorphs! So, it's not okay to shoot humans but it is okay to shoot alien zombies and literally tear them limb by limb? Where is the justice in that? I see a lot more things that could be terrifying (especially for the children who want to play the games as well) in a Dead Space type of game than just a game where the player must fend off waves of mindless humanoid enemies. Don't even get me started on the Silent Hills!
 I, personally, don't sympathize with the human race much anyways so I find that killing them in game is a much better alternative to killing them in real life. It's less messy, there's no need to clean the mess and no consequences afterwards so every one should believe that I won't become a mass murderer any time soon. Videogames, no matter how much the mass media would like to hate, serve as a very great learning tool as well. Like the airport scene in MW2 again for example: If parents allow their child to play through that mission and observe as their child murders, they can own that moment and talk to the child in an effort to explain why it is wrong to do that kind of thing. It's all the parent's job to bring that child up right. The videogame can be a very positive thing.
 Also, imagine a five-year old that has barely started first grade (like my little brother). I took that five-year old to GameStop and let him pick out his own game. Luckily, he chose an eleven dollar copy of Dead Space, so it was cheap but also kind of ""iffy"", especially for a child his age. He might've thought it'd have been a cool Star Wars game, I don't know.However, the moment he put that game in, he was excited to play it! When I told him it was going to be a scary game, he just asked me to turn the lights on and so I did. He still was kind of scared and got killed a lot by the bigger monsters so I helped him out in the action sequences but would anyone believe that this kid figured out every puzzle for himself?! It was the most exciting thing I saw in a long time! I went back and played the game for myself and I, an adult, had problems figuring some of the stuff out. A child though!? By the time the credits rolled he was shaking the game offlike it was nothing!Videogames can be really fun that way!
 Anyways, I felt like I had to get that off my chest a little bit. Sorry for the YouTube essay. My point throughout this whole ""lecture"" of mine was that videogames are not the cause of mass shootings, instead, unloved children are. Also, that videogames are not necessarily bad and can serve as learning tools for anyone who plays them."
19421,"Games arent real its not like youre insede the actual game doing it yourself.Besides these people who hate games cause of some war related scenes is stupid and take offence to war games because their sons and husbands died in war That is why its called war,dont expect your family member to live long.Besides my cousin died in afgan but hell he chose to go there.Games are nothing compared to real video footage about war nothing compares to it.Games censor most of the grueson details about murder and shit.sorry for my english and this long comment :D"
19422,at 20 seconds the statement made by the fox talking head is applicable to MAINSTREAM NEWS.....THANK YOU BRIAN WILLIAMS FOR SOME SANITY......LOL.......sarc/on
19423,While I agree with the idea of the video I think you need to check your research. Did you compile this video after a ten minute youtube search? Im from Australia and I was able to play all the games you mentioned on release date. This and many other so called facts are inaccurate at best. But I do believe in the point you were trying to make.
19424,it just a bloody game fuck off and a real life and people who play games are fun it doesnt mean that we are going out just to do it
19425,POKEMON IS STILL THE BEST GAME EVER IF THESE STUPID ADULTS WOULD SIT DOWN AND SEE WHAT THE GAME IS THEY WOULDNT BE SUCH JERKS ABOUT IT JEEZ!
19426,"When it came to ""No Russian"", I didn't even think twice about the fact I was about to massacre a bunch of civilians. Why? Because it's a game. I know that when I pull the trigger in a game, no one is actually getting hurt."
19427,"Fox ""news"" is NOT news!"
19428,I hate how games are blamed for shootings. Just cause a guy who shot someone  played doom doesn't mean that he got it from doom. Jesus
19429,Mass murderers have been around before pong actually. Where did they get their training?
19430,"Fueled by Conservative Media You're full of shit MoJo, it's the Libtards that want to ban everything and haver it all under control."
19431,"#1 is Mortal Kombat. I'm 3 minutes into this video and already know some stupid GTA crap will be #1, but Mortal Kombat INVENTED the ESRB and when I was young seeing the fatalities was amazing.
2015 is different than the 90s. What Mortal Kombat did in the 90s just destroys anything that was done in the 00s/2010s."
19432,"As a student studying media/communications I'd just like to say that scientists, the guys who actualy know wtf they are talking about, abondoned the ""injection/magic bullet theory"" (ie play a violent game and you become violent) in the 1940's.
So why the fuck is this still a thing??"
19433,I put my gun on the porch the other day to see what it would do unsupervised. I went and got it a few hours later it was still full and had not moved an inch. I also played video games while I was doing this I would not hurt anyone and neither will my gun. Two stereotypes taken care of rite there.
19434,All of these games piss me off because here in Mexico kids are all addicted to these games and parents don't see that. No wonder they become assassins. And I don't know why they did not ban them.
19435,80% of games have a lot of blood and killing so what? But it's okay for them to do it in movies?
19436,When the movie Bambi was released several people accused of murder cited it as an influence as they identified more with the hunter than Bambi's mom. Ban Bambi NOW!
19437,people made video games because life is boring...
19438,how can Pokemon teaches children Witchcraft and Wizardry

19440,"give it 30 years and we will get ""six days in fallujah"" the wounds need time to settle before a historical storytelling game like that can be made.

If you are fully aware that they may not be able to see the difference between actions permitted in Video Games Vs. actions allowed in the real world or is mentally handicapped in a way which would allow video games to be such an influence, DON'T LET THEM PLAY VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES! That is all..."

Yeah they should see counter strike!"
19471,"I dont know but. Most of these mass school shootings happen in America. In Europe you can easily get the same games as in America. Yet there are no shootings here, atleast not many. You kind of get a feeling somethings wrong there rather than with video games itself..."
19472,"Parenting or home life is another factor not mentioned as much as blaming the video games by itself. If the parents let their kid do whatever they want, let the walk all over them, and have no boundaries, then they have no one to blame but THEMSELVES."

19488,"The US Government be like MAC( Mothers Againts Canada from South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut), they're like our children are killing each other because we bought a bunch of guns and a whole lot of ammo and put them in their rooms, and we taught them how to shoot! Who they we blame? VIDEO GAMES! Despite the fact that they had never been exposed or been playing any video game we blame video games! You know what fuck the American Government, and most of all FUCK JACK THOMPSON!"
19489,why would you use fox news as a credible source.
19490,Lol they make you dumb. They make you wanna kill people.. That's why I fold a 3.5 gpa and would vomit if I seen a person get shot huh?
19491,most of the reporters were on Fox News. they spray a lot o hotshot.
19492,"So Dumb how they want video games banned, yet there are movies with real people getting shot but this isnt bad?
Call of duty world at war was great it had the realistic deaths in place, then obviously they had to stop all that no or litttle blood.
There should be a simple setting, if you want violence enable it, if not disable."

19494,"I have a hypothesis as to the link between violent video games and violent actions in the real world: kids with violent tendencies tend to play more violent video games. Now bear in mind, this is just a hypothesis, but it's worth considering. Just remember when you think one thing causes another: Correlation  Causation"
19495,Am I the only one who thinks that these people are turning games into controversies just so WE get angry?
19496,Wow that first one was so fucking stupid. Dumb feminists. Pfft
19497,"3:29
I haved personally purchased all those games and I live down under. A common mistake as far as I'm concerned to other countries. But, that is not my point. I'm about to get angry. Okay. THEY SAY THAT THE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS WERE INFLUENCED BY VIDEO GAMES BECAUSE THE KIDS SAY THE PLAYED THEM... EVERY.SINGLE.KID BLOODY PLAYS VIDEO GAMES EVERYDAY!!!!! THESE ARE THE RARE 1 OUT OF 1000 ALREADY MENTALLY ILL KIDS THAT CANT DISTINGUISH REAL FROM VIDEO GAME. I am done."
19498,"WTF how could anyone find a way to critisie pokemon? idk whoever does needs to take a chill pill. it is not demonic, WATCH THE FRIGGING ANIME"
19499,"So why isn't there a game where you go around crushing animal skulls with crowbars? It's just a game right? It's not going to effect to the animal violence rate? Boy I'd love to see the reaction to that.
I'd love to see an experiment where movie violence was intercut with real footage of killing/gore without the participents knowing it. Would it still be ok to say it didn't effect them, that it was cool to watch?"
19500,"Yeah they get on video games about their ""excessive violence"" yet look at movies, specifically those with gore in them, those are just as violent as most video games, there are movies that show sex in them that aren't considered controversial, and look at how many mob themed movies there are that show crime syndicates doing what they do; murder, drug trafficking, and paying off the authorities.

19504,"All the news is targeting video games, or has since the 1990's. A quick search on Google revealed countless liberal and conservative outlets trying to find a scapegoat for these acts of violence. I am not a fan of fox news, heck I think all the major new outlets suck. But your statement in the end is unnecessary and factually inaccurate. There is no need to twist data in order to assault Fox news, as they provide you with enough ammo should you actually put any real amount of effort into.
Then again you're probably one of those young fools who thinks the MSNBC and ABC are 100% unbiased, and only fox serves a parties agenda."

What a coincidence."

19510,Yep bitches be tripping
19511,Every single thing about Grand theft  auto five there's a game that deserves all the bullshit controversy it's called grand theft auto vice city
19512,"I like how people judge something they don't even know correctly. In COD MW2, in the ""No Russian"" mission, you actually play with a cop that is trying to earn Makarov's trust so he can kill Makarov's before he almost destroys the entire world. Actually, later on that mission, you die because Makarov find out that you're a traitor. If the cop had succeeded, all the entire MW3 wouldn't exist, all those people that died in MW3 (RIP Soap) would be alive, but, just as Yuri, the cop failed his mission to stop Makarov.
In ""Night Trap"" you actually try to avoid these woman getting caught and killed.
Sorry for my bad English (I'm not a native speaker)"
19513,"I'm a woman who's played violent video games since I was young, and I would never do those things in real
 Life(unless there was a zombie apocalypse amd I HAD to kill zombies). If video games are considered dangerous, what about books that have that same content? I don't go out killing, etc, all cuz I play violent video games."
19514,I almost want to shoot myself because how can anyone watch an video about video games which is only on 360p
19515,"Video games, TV, and guns are not responsible for the mass shootings! The Shooter is responsible!"
19516,"The Modern Warfare 2 mission, I played it and i couldn't bring myself to participate in the slaughter. I only shot back at those shooting at me."
19517,sigh... I hate republicans...
19518,Pokemon is satanic though. Just look up the names of the pokemons and they are names of Japanese demons
19519,I hate government saying mw2 is to realistic and violint it is a war game what do you expect ponies and fluffy sickers
19520,this is one example of why fox news needs to be removed
19521,"OMFG why is MW2 ""No Russian"" even mentioned?
First, you get the choice to skip it. The first time i got around to it, playing this with my FATHER, he told me to skip it if i got the chance, so i did. Of course, though i snuck it in and played the mission. The man in the video said VERY REALISTIC. BULLSHIT
COMPLETELY BULLSHIT. When and where are you going to get into an airport with ALL OF THAT on you? guns, explosives, armor that is visible? would not work. Also, lets say that they do manage to get in. There is tons more security, and they are trained well. This mission was completely made to inflict more hatred on Makerov and his men, and to strengthen the story line. They did not add it just so that these idiots that havent even seen the full mission and fail to use critical thinking could say ""this is why there are shootings"" I get that what happened in that mission was terrible, and say you dont skip because you dont know what it is. you can skip as soon as you see 4 guys armored with LMGs and tons of civilians standing there as you aim your weapon. Stop crying about shootings and video games because they have nothing in common."

19531,"apparently when some one dies or gets killed, all the media says is: guns don't kill people, neather mental disease, VIDEO GAMES DO!!!! Whoever blames a video game for real life envents is just some fucking idiot that has never played one in their life and that has no one else to blame for since that is the only thing they know of how to do, instead of coming with an actual solution that makes sense. like, don't sell guns to people that are mentally unstable, instead of banning the game."
19532,The worst game i have ever played was State of Emergency that Sh!t was epic... Who agrees?

This is my opinion hater comments should be abandoned because in real life would you say that to my face?"
19537,"im not going to whine and cry about how the media loves to censor games. we all know they just want to talk about that crap since contraversy makes money. im sure half of them don't even believe in that crap.
im wondering how Call of Duty had a spot higher than Mortal Kombat and GTA. Ya know, the real games that stirred things up. In GTA, you kill innocent civilians just because you don't want to start another mission, and only to be busted and released a few hours later."
19538,ITS NOT THE GAME but THE LAG
19539,"Who gives a shit?! If you're so worried about your kids growing up and being a terrorist, don't buy them rated M game at 5 years old. Wait at least until they're 12 or 14 when not brains are not so vulnerable to this shit. Oh and btw nobody repeat nobody gives 10 amounts of fuck about that war games that are based off real battles. I mean Call of Duty World at War was BASED on real battles dud people complain about that? No.
This is not to the creator of the video, its to the people out there who like to bitch about M rated games."
19540,wait.. so FOX news is against a game that's about a war/battle that happened? that's the pinnacle of hypocrisy right there..
19541,this is nothing compared to some of the movies that come out today! they don't care that people can watch movies about mass serial killers and all this! just like those sex scenes in the game... they are so insignificant compared to full blown sex scenes in some movies.

19549,"Wait, wait. every second PERSON (Staff, women and males alike) at my school plays 1st person shooters almost religiously and they were going to blame his playing of a 1st person shooter on a mass murder? To be honest if the person gained a desire to kill those around him through video games and acted upon that desire he was bound for that act video games or no."
19550,Studies have shown. Real studies not the one sided conservative ass holes studies. That since the introduction of violent video games. Violent crime has dropped as much as 50%. Not saying it was the video games that have done that. But still to say that violence in video games makes you violent is ignorant.  Disturbed people and kids are always going to break our hearts by doin horrific things. I myself am an avid gamer and former marine. And if you think for one moment that a video game teaches someone how to use a gun or desensitize them to real violence then you are quite wrong. I can tell you that C.O.D sure as hell didn't prepare me for war.

I know this sounds really harsh but I think this is the only way to stop (and make people fear) KILLING."
19553,Fox News. The number 1 comedy show. Filled with stupidity and Amusing antics.
19554,"People always get mad at the video game devs for making games, and yet will still go out and buy their 9 year olds games that are intended for a MATURE audience. The game makers aren't the ones putting the games in kids' hands, it's irresponsible parents. Even if they are not the ones buying the games for their kids, they're being played under their roofs which is essentially the same. I love GTA and SR and games like that, but never IN MY LIFE would I buy or allow my children to play such games until they were old and mature enough to handle it."

I just watched a video of no russian so illuminati confirmed xD"
19565,"Those assholes on the media piss me off so much with their bias and overall stupidity. Yes, in a game where you kill people, there is a level of sadism and evilness there, but that sadism won't leave the confines of your XBOX so long as your mental state is normal.
Under the same logic those reporters spout, we should ban all water since criminals drink water."
19566,"#4 Really pisses me off. Yes, your son died in combat. Guess what lady, a lot of peoples children die in combat. But there is a difference between then and now, we are not in a draft. He volunteered, he wanted to go, he died for his country as he was willing to. So your argument is invalid, but my prayers go to your loss."
19567,"Of course. It's pretty obvious that games are to blame for mass shootings because they became a part of mass culture in the early 1970's. Who would blame music or television or whatever else? It's just ridiculous. Whenever a mass murderer (or not a mass one, or a robber/rapist/whoever) is known to play games, the spark then comes a fire that is trying to ban videogames. But what about the rest of them? What about those, who didn't play games? And their numbers are way higher.
P.S. From what I know, the videogames have been recognized as an art form in the USA in 2011. You're still blaming games? Why don't you blame paintings? You know why? Because that's bullshit.
P.P.S. Sorry about that. It's just so annoying that people blame games for everything."
19568,"The only games that I can think of that should've made the list is one where you play as one of the shooters of the columbine highschool incident, and a Japanese porn game called ""Rapelay"" where you rape an entire family of 3."

and now the same shit for video games.
i stand up for elderly on the bus so they can sit.
i give people money when they are 2 bucks short, even if i cant eat alot because of it.

People shoot people for real life problems which can be anything from bullying or just being insane and even drugs and so on. They don't play call of duty hit a quickscope for the first time then next day a school take a Fucking barret with and jump off his desk spin then shoot. We gamers are not Fucking retarded. We understand it's a Game that's why we play them. So we can freely do it and keep it there because it will not have a penalty to it because you just respawn. For fucks sake. Everyone has the type of game the play from FPS to RPG or MMORPG or even puzzle. We understand that's it's a game and that it stays in the game. You call us dumb for doing it then someone goes off and shoots up some place. What are you going to do. Oh this kid plays MineCraft. Oh what's that? Oh I don't know just a game of some sort. Oh clearly it's minecrafts fault that this guy shot two people then himself. Says here the two he shot bullied him all his life.... Hmmmm. Yup the videogame was the cause. Dumbasses.

19591,"I like how apparently only video games are to blame when books are sometimes just as vivid, detailed, and explicit if not more, and TV shows and movies are usually 10 times as realistic (now some games are on par)
The only thing i've seen come out of that is desensitizing in most cases immoral in decision making, but necessary for perseverance.
It's like school shooting:
MEDIA/PRESS: He played the video game CoD that's likely the cause to such a tragic event
What he actually did more than play the one shooter: read a bunch of dark explicitly detailed horrors and massacre books which i think is way more likely to have a psychological impact on a person
had to rage a bit hard here, so mind me -.-
   What is it some they say when looking at a case( in my shows anyways) Look at everything and ASSUME NOTHING, which is all the dumba** media and the people that blindly take their word to law and fact, regardless of how illogical it may seem or how well it's been disproved it may be .
.
   And pokemon!? witchcraft!?!?!?!? IS HE STUPID.... We're obviously f***ing summoning demons from hell itself, of course pokemon teaches people how to cast spells, makes 100% sense i learned to summon a pikachu the other day .

19618,you know whats funny? Parents are complaining that games make their children psychopathic but not a single damn person mentions the responsebillity of parents to teach their child the diffrence between games and reallity!
19619,"The industry needs to change. It's not just video games it's everything else as well. You can play the blame game all you like but we all are to blame. It's not guns or video games that is the problem, the problem is people. We sit kids in front of a television and let them indulge in the sex, murder and and acceptance to sin. They live their lives around people who indulge in this, even ourselves. This is to be expected after all we are human, but then again aren't we capable. Change is at our fingertips and here we are playing the blame game. We need action, knowledge and a good sense of morality. It's not just video games that corrupts, we do it every day and many do not even notice. However I feel a change will come and soon, one way or another."
19620,I think the concept on mass effect sex scenes was just hilarious because these are people who never played the game 1 and 2 the game isn't objectifying women because its not like you can just take them all and that's what they are good for only and you can also play as a female character and 3 modern TV shows that people watch including kids have more nudity sex and sexually references then all the mass effect games combined so in actuality they should be covering all the garbage that's on TV instead of mass effect
19621,you know what guys all these people in the news just cant withstand fun i mean they think they every that is way violant has to be baned there are a bunch of jackasses who just wont let their children have fun.and the last part gta 5 controversery really pissed me OFF! cuz gta 5 is awesome in that u can stuff that cant do in real life like for example your girlfriend dumped you and so you want to get drunk but you are not alcoholic so u can get digital drunk instead and just keep on thinking about her and then you enjoy gta 5 by murdering stealing etc this proves fun games like gta 5 are because thease games can make you enjoy even though your sad.
19622,"lol, I like how dumb asses like those news people always blame the ""shootings"" on video games, when i play cod or any other shooter games i dont want to go and shoot people in real life. that is just like saying ""well all of these nba or nfl games are making kids become nfl or nba stars"" its just crazy these days..."
19623,Its always in the US that certain people blame violent video games from everything to mental afflictions to murder(If we disregard Australia).If a heated discussion about Mortal Combat ended up in our Parliament we would consider them crazy!
19624,"NEVER play games like Pokemon,it can make you evil and lead to all sorts of mental affilictions.Its not all that different than what some fanatical christians and others said in the 50""s about Rock""n Roll which was dangerous and corrupted the minds of young people.And DO""NT play ""Splatterhouse"" it will probably turn you into a bloodthirsty serial killer!"
19625,"I swear to god I would beat the shit out of these stupid retarded americans who say and defend that videos games are satanic and they are the cause of mass shootings and they make fun of soldiers who lost their lives in Fallujah etc
ITS VIDEO GAMES FFS !"
19626,games? really? thats your concern? how bout unemployment? real life killing? blaming on games? seriously?
19627,"Fuck stupid people, games are fun and they think games are bad, piss of goverment is not the videogames is the people who are so ignorant and stupid, fuck people, videogames rule and that would never change"
19628,I find it sad that people think video games cause violence.
19629,"They blame video games for mass shootings while ignoring that mental illness is a reality and usually those shooters have a mental illness of some sort. But nobody seems to want to talk about that fact and instead turn their heads away toward something else. No wonder they're are so many messed up people in the world. A lot of work has to be put into to convincing medical professionals, the public and politicians (and of course the media) that mental illness is more of a factor then anything else."
19630,getting upset because of sex in an 18+ game. okay. because sex is such a bad terrible thing noone should know about until they're 30.
19631,Look at all these autistic activists
19632,This is the problem with old timers and new games cuase they allways think that modern games are the cuase of people knowing how to use guns when modern games are sopos to let you do things that you cannot do in real life cuase if you trying these things in real life then you go to jail but in games you can do it as muchas you want to and only your character go's to jail in the game and not you in real life ):
19633,blaming FUCKING VIDEO GAMES FOR YOUR PROBLEMS white people man i swear
19634,"All these controversies are stupid as fuck. People need to shut the fuck up, its just the like the movies we watch, ENTERTAINMENT."
19635,"News stations need to realize that just because someone plays a video game with guns, it doesn't necessarily mean that they can pick up a firearm and properly use it. To be fair, one has to know more than the principle of pointing, shooting and reloading a gun in order to use it. So many of these arguments are purely pulling on the idea that ""oh! You play a shooting game and can get a 10 headshot 'kill streak' with a sniper rifle! This means you're an expert marksman in real life too!"" Come on people. This has nothing to do with games. It's the gun regulations that are the main issue. Yes, I am an American."
19636,"So that's why parents are horrified of their kids playing Mortal Kombat. Right, @Phillip Rubio and @Shadow The Hedgehog ?"
19637,"Get rid of violent video games, but dont take are real guns, its fucking bullshit
well done"
19638,"ive noticed a pattern here. white republicans telling us that games with guns are bad and what games we can play, but if you you tell them to get rid of there real guns they shit their pants."
19639,I have never seen as many keyboard warriors as I have in these comments.
19640,"I have no issue with violent video games that give you the option to be horrible. I assume most people are aware they are doing something terrible, and that it is fictional: In real life, people don't respawn.
My only problem is when it is the focus: Who would want to play a game about murdering people for fun? What sicko would be entertained by that? Such fantasies should not be enabled or encouraged. That Manhunt game for instance... I mean, why? Why even play it? Its a bad game, you know that, curiosity sated. That should be the end of the story."
19641,Taking Fox News Seriously ? Now that's offensive
19642,people are fucking stupid .
19643,People that dont know about video games shouldnt be allowed to do news reports on video games
19644,"Fuck all you assholes who banned  and tried to ban good games,"
19645,A little disappointed that the top spot is blamed most heavily by conservatives and how you ignore the vast network of left-leaning media outlets that decried mass-shootings as the fault of video-games as well.
19646,"to the fat bitch saying complaining about ""kids sitting around laughing because they did or didnt die but my son didnt have a choice"" um yes he did bitch, he could have chose not to join the army?"
19647,"When has a video game made someone go out and steal a cop car and go on a murder spree? When has a game make someone rip someone's heart out? People are just too sensitive. Plus, blame the parents. If you don't want your precious child playing violent video games, don't fucking buy it in the first place."
19648,
19649,this is why video game ratings exist
19650,"LOOK A WAR IN AFGANISTAN
WE COULD GET OIL LETS KILL PEOPLE FOR THAT
america
pls cmon a game about war canceled because of some old american lady and some soldiers who killed civilians (sry for the soldiers who didnt do that)"
19651,"So.. If Pokemon influences witchcraft. GTA influences violent acts. Then Pac-Man would have affected my parents as kids, they would all be running around in dark rooms, munching pills and listening to repetitive electronic music. This is just my opinion though..."
19652,The liberals blame them just as much. Like that whore clinton
19653,"Ok of ALL that was mentioned here number 3 is actually very understandably horrific even for a gamer like me that have played a LOT of gory games but this one made me cringe...
Especially considering how oversensitive media is towards gaming its no shocker that scene caught massive flak....not to mention the bulk of COD audience are kids and that scene was pure terrorism and honestly shouldn't be in a game.."
19654,"I'm laughing at all the people who say, don't blame videogames, blame guns! We hell, people kill people with knives, let's ban knife sales! How am I going to cut my steak up now?? Wait, don't people kill people with hands? Let's ban hands! We will cut off all our hands! Oh and cars too! Bc they have been used to kill people also. So in the end, we will be a handless, legless human wiggling on the ground to go somewhere bc of no cars, who cant cut our steaks."
19655,"Ppfff... To not release Six Days in Fallujah is a refusal of history, and a denial of real events that did happen. It's disgusting. Those stories should be remembered, cherished, and shown for all in chilling, true, interactive messages. The notion that anyone could sit there and say it shouldn't be released... you should be shot for saying such a thing.
RO2: Heroes of Stalingrad is essentially the same thing. wouldn't people find it rather scary if they lost their grandfathers/fathers in that battle? Yes. Would they campaign against it? They just might. but to not publish a game like that is a denial of history. A mark of stupidity and ignorance. Who cares if it's irreproachable? That's war for you."
19656,"I don't get why so many games aren't in Australia. My employer, Saxton Hale said that violence is love and that violence is life in Australia."
19657,"Isn't it weird that the people complaining about video games being violent are republicans, (Fox News)."
19658,"it annoys me so much that these congress people and everyone who fights video games are so against them, basically judging them without knowledge of the whole scenario. plus, there are a lot of people who are video game addicts that are not killers. are you going to blame someone who did a shootout who also was addicted to chess bad? is that the chessboard's fault? video games make a clear distinction between reality and fake. if you are mental enough to do what you do in a video game, then you had a problem before playing said game."
19659,"if they played more games instead of going to war, that would be great"
19660,"video games don't kill people, mentally unstable people kill people if they are given a firearm"
19661,Fox News is fucking retarded.
19662,"A word to people who dis violent(totally not) games
LEAVE US ALONE"
19663,"FUCK YOU POLITICIANCS!!!!!!!!
ALWAYS LOKKIN FOR THE EASY ANSWER
y not blame hello kitty island adventure?
Now thats a chalenge
Or blame beiber
noone disagrees with that"
19664,"How does Pokemon teach witchcraft, you don't cast any spells and video games do not tell you ""go shoot 20 people, its actually mentally unstable kids who are mostly bullied and government mass hysteria"
19665,Mortal kombat is#1. It set the stage for ratings & had was featured on the cover most magazines during the 90s. No other game has done that
19666,"Almost every gamer plays some kind of FPS game, it's completely illogical to blame the games..."
19667,Did anyone else notice anyone else notice that over half (maybe as much as 2/3) of those news scenes were fox?
19668,Video games don't make us violent lag does
19669,"Damn this comment section o_o
They hate how people play the blame game... then blame America. When it gets right down to it, I think people should be taught logic and how to appreciate human life. That way, they can easily differentiate what is real and what is a video fucking game.
My dad always told me growing up that video games would make me go ""brain dead."" Here I am now, a programmer that ditched high school that tutors adults in college.
Anyway, that's not the point. The individual is the only one that holds any real weight... If that individual knows what is real and what is not, they should be able to sort things out themselves.
I really like how they added that last clip at the very end of the video. Mental illness. Stop blaming video games, conservatives, liberals, the government, and all that tripe. Look at the individual."
19670,Most of these reporters never played the damn games
19671,"I dont agree with :
1. The Mortal Kombat blood controversy
Because its a FIGHTING GAME! ITS SUPPOSE TO BE BLOODY!
2. The 6 Days In Fallujah controversy
Because i hate people who are just trying ot make money out of a historical event, and then stopping them through some stupid reasom like : "" My child was dead on that battlefield "" (THEN WHY DID HE JOIN THE ARMY? THATS THE CONSEQUENCE!) "" I lost many of my relatives "" (facepalm THEN WHY DID YOU NOT EVACUATE?)
3. The Mass Murders controverrsy
Because its not because the game is violent, think about other ways to sunday, it could be psychological, mental, or financial crisis', you news people should do your research before making the GOD DAMN NEWS!
4. GTA controversy
Because its rated M for a reason, parents who buy this game for their kids ARE the real culprits, does'nt matter what the news say, its all the parents fault!"
19672,I just wish people would stop blaming shootings on CoD.
19673,"banning video games are a form of censorship, and if you advocate censorship, get the fuck out of america"
19674,I don't get it. Fucking Fat Americans keep buying pegi 18 games for theyre 9 year old kids and then complain about fucking violence and sexscenes??? fucking idiots
19675,"You know video games are not to blame  they have their warnings and ESRB tags and such but if you break the rules and play the game IT'S YOUR OWN DAMM FAULT and if you are so weak minded and easily influenced person go to a freaking hospital.
that's so America kid gets a k18 game goes mad and gets influenced by it and that is games fault not the parents who bought the game not the kid who plays the game no its the company's fault that the kid plays k18 games they should have watched over the kid.
Sigh in my country these games never made it to the news because we don't buy CoD's to 9 years old kids or we actually ain't brain damaged to get influenced by a fps shooter and boo how if game is made by a real event and then gets to head lines and shit like I lost a son in there well to bad get over it be a man and don't cry about it I mean the falluja game is so evil and Media they are just so bad and don't have any stuff to report about so let's cry abut video games based on real events.
Sigh and Yes I know my English is horrid give me a break."
19676,"Hmm, I was playing Mortal Kombat on SN before I was ten. First horror movie I saw was when my gma rented Hellbound with Chuck Norris. I've learned to love John Wayne. I then watched Stephen King's IT and got scarred. Now, I love horror movies, and I've beaten Vice City over ten times. Vercetti would whip Claude's butt. First sexy movie I saw was American Pie. Kenny turning into a zombie was my fave South Park episode. Oh, and I like guns: People kill people, not guns. Take them away, there are still knives, poison, nooses, and bare hands. Gonna make those illegal too? HOw will we eat without knives and hands? Also, I like meat, and won't become a vegan or vegetarian."
19677,"We're gamers, not pussies. It's almost a TWD (The Walking Dead) war. This is disgusting. What right do they have to put us in jail for mods? Equivalent logic."
19678,Meh. Get over it. Nowadays its all about making Muslims public enemy number 1 and killing them in video games.
19679,"Video games can cause real violence. But it's so rare and most of those activities involves no killing, just a psychotic person who doesn't know better. 99% of gamers knows what's reality and what's not. It's the parents fault for letting their mentally ill kids play video games. And besides all gamers are just tough guys when they play online."
19680,"Only in America can the violence of real guns, be blamed on virtual ones."
19681,"The problems aren't there because of video games, and they're not there because of guns. Shooters shoot because of psychological reasons that are not being addressed on an individual basis. We do not focus enough on the mentally ill in America because we fear public health institutions and brand them as ""socialist"". Children are raised being abused and neglected, yet their cries are not listened to because ""there isn't enough funding"". Crime is nothing but a side effect of capitalism."
19682,All this fuss over gun control. And the patriots who fight against it who clearly have no idea how gun control works. The idea is to make it harder for those who have the highest likely chance of causing a mass shooting to cause a mass shooting. Which 9 times out of 10 tends to be those with mental instability and tend to be random American civs themselves. But what can you expect from a country where it's literally cheaper to buy alcohol than water?
19683,Custer's Revenge should have been on the list. It's a game where you rape native american women.... I mean come one guys what the fuck where they thinking when they made that!
19684,"Love how Fox ""News"" was at the forefront of this shit. I fucking hate them with a passion"
19685,"Oh, i'm sorry.  I was too busy finishing up a game of GTA Online then getting in a car with my dad, heading down to shooting range.  Shooting guns, then watch some violent movies.  And end the day with a round or two of Call Of Duty or Halo
My day in a freaking mutshell"
19686,really we all now as much as call of duty fans are in the world call of duty isn't going no were and you just blame it on a game because you have nothing else to blame and that a lot of people play it its like when call of duty wasn't around if someone got shot the person who shot them are crazy or psycho but now its like something happens blame it on the game that does it. even thought im a cod fan I wish luck on battlefield once bf hardline comes out
19687,"The controversie that pisses me off is about ""Transformers""
Why can't Optimis just immediately kill Megatron? We don't need that pathetic character to exist anymore."
19688,"I wish HATRED was published in 2000. At least then we'd have HATRED 3, maybe, less butthurt tool"
19689,"I have a huge problem with the complaints about Six Days in Fallujah. To put it short, a realistic war game has already happened. Many of them have already happened. World War II was featured in one, but you don't see parents screaming about their kids killing virtual Nazis. 
Six Days in Fallujah would also have been some sort of educational experience for the public, as I and many people I know have never heard of the battle myself, if there were real Marine accounts being implemented into the scenery, action, and events."
19690,Swatting should be #2.
19691,Okay I get it ! But really !? It's a game ! It's not real tho it can be based of a real event but like always people get mad about a little thing and they don't get mad at bombings that happens in countries #MarilynManson
19692,"Guns don't kill people, people who say guns don't kill people.. Kill people.. With guns."
19693,"hahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.......
pokemon = witch craft??
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah.......
sorry....i just cannot stop laughing....i've been playing pokemon games throughout my life and I never even think of the possibility of that..how do these people came out with this thing?"
19694,Game at 3:28?
19695,Lol notice most of the anti gaming news clips were from the highly biased fox news
19696,they never mention the first pick. wtf. lol it goes on a tangent and then never returns
19697,"I just love that almost all of the games that got media attention was thru Fox News, cause they overreact to everything."
19698,"You know what would be amazing? The prosecutioner calling 2 guys for his next exhibit to replicate the violence of Mortal Kombat. ""GET over here"" throws lasso around 2nd guy neck Does a split, hits the guy in the nuts and puts his Reybans on !FATALITY!
Pee on the floor, then use the court room fire extinguisher to freeze the piss, TOASTY
""So you see your honor it's very similar to real life situation and a perfect example of why this game should be banned"""
19699,i wonder if this list will get updated when murder comes out
19700,"""Like the time playstation was compromised and credit card information was stolen""
You mean every month right?"
19701,99% of these are a bunch of old people who just want something to bitch about. They are FINE with movie sex and murder but not games....well i say fuck you guys.
19702,People are so damn hypocritical. We all love violence and sex.
19703,"blaming video games is just avoiding the real problems. the real reasons connected to school shootings are issues such as social privilege, gun laws, lack of security systems, flawed mental health institutions and last but not least, the previous generation refusing to face the problems and help fix them."
19704,Maybe parents should be more involved in their kids lives. Problem solved. stop letting your little kids play Mature rating games before they understand morals..
19705,"Postal 1 and 2 must be so controversial that they weren't even dared to be mentioned in this list,lol."
19706,"67% of people are gamers.
do you see 67% of people acting like the people in videogames?"
19707,"Before video games, people blamed TV for society's ills. Before that, subversive books"
19708,"For number one I say, if you play minecraft, do you go outside and try to mine a tree with your fists, if you play skyrim do you go and try to find dragon souls to consume, because if not, I don't see why first person shooters should convince people to do something even more stupid. (What above is excluding LARPing)"
19709,Jinx...racist?.....uncultured idiots its not racist its a reference to Japaneses mythology
19710,yo but seriously what's with that GTA torture scene? That's fucked up
19711,"Crazy people do crazy things, not your average joe trying to enjoy himself or herself with some video games, guns being legally sold isn't the issue, it's the people that use them. Everyone wants to put blame on everything but themselves in order to protect their ego. Video games are one of the many forms of entertainment that we have in this day and age. It's sad the amount of ignorance there is in the world and yet everyone is so fast to jump the gun like they know something (no pun intended). Maybe if some parents stepped up and actually taught these kids that you shouldn't take a gun to someone's face in real life and that video games are fake then just maybe will we see these ridiculous stories go away for good. Normal people don't see gta or any other ""violent"" game as a training exercise and a good idea to do in real life, crazy, uneducated people do yet the media likes to blame the whole tree because of the few bad apples. Parents need to start stepping up and taking responsibility for their children, It's ridiculous how a child that does good in life always has parents looking to take some credit for their child's successes, but when it gets turned around and the child is bad the parents apparently have nothing to do with it which is crap."
19712,"7:28
Is that a raping game? o_O"
19713,my mom doesent let me play violent video games beacause he thinks im gonna be a psychopath
19714,You forgot postal 2 lol...
19715,"What's that? Another shooting? Hmm, better blame it on those violent video games, because none of us realize the main cause of all of these tragedies is not because the person got their hands on that game, but they got their hands on a weapon."
19716,"The media tells us how bad games are, yet they sell commercial for pills, USA sell fucking guns in your closest local store, gambling, ads for how heroic the army is... As the mighty Vinnie Paz once said: ""One type of prison is where you are free and don't see the bars, because the bars are planted inside your mind by the media, telling us what to do an what to believe in."""
19717,What about splatter house?
19718,I'd prefer to decide what I should and shouldn't play myself. I don't need a suit to tell me that....
19719,I thought state of emergency would've made their list for sure.
19720,i hate the media so much instead of blaming the shitty ass parents having guns in their houses they blame music artists and video games instead of actual bad ppl or stupid ppl

19727,I don't know why those idiots got mad over that game because their children died in that battle nobody gave a shit when any ww2 game came out and I'm pretty sure way more people died in that battle

19729,"you didnt have to shoot the civilians in mw2, you dont have to go on killing rampages in gta, but people do.dont blame video games if someone kills another, wouldnt they have mental illnesses?"
19730,"Wow, I'm actually shocked at how well WatchMojo threw their views out on the last spot. They had the balls to go out and say that something that is still controversial today is the absolute bullshit that it is. Huge respect."
19731,"Lol, what game is 3:28 from? Seems like a nice child friendly game I wanna play amirite?"
19732,"I'm glad that people are starting to become more use to the idea of video games so that now it's more rare for one to be blamed for a individual(s) real life choice. It seems like the only ones complaining about them, are people who have never touched a game in their life or hasn't played anything more graphic then Mario. And if a game does have a affect on someone's action, then chance are, they already had something going on with them. People need to stop over reacting to video games because they're just games and shouldn't be taken seriously, so stop bitching over content."
19733,"that was rich, great job WatchMojo"
19734,"Tbh, News Media should be the one that should be banned, or their stories should be moderated by Governments, because I know that the News Media is a fucking shitty place, all they do is just exploit everything around them, every single little thing and there are tendencies where it tends to be FALSE, and that FALSE thing can be a pretty big thing, even if the thing was small it can be BIG."
19735,I like how pretty much all of the reports were on Fox News.
19736,This is bullshit. It is a video game. A game. They act like everyone hasnt heard of killings and violence.
19737,What is the game at 3:25?
19738,I need to keep playing Metal Gear Solid. Hopefully I'll gather the skills enough to be able to sneak past anyone with a cardboard box!
19739,the black chick at the end is correct Violence in games can be (for me) a healthy outlet but as for the fear mongering and religion I say this if I ever make a game and it goes to courts for controversy issue the guys better be ready to fight fist tooth and nail cause they'll be attiring my art and my beliefs many gamers like me will fight physically if we can to defend our rights.
19740,Anita Sarkeesian ?
19741,"It isn't because of games it is the persons mental condition,ability to comprehend that it is just a game,and the fact that this person should not have any access to any fire arms"
19742,I'm gonna go out on a limb and blame bullying for school shootings. Can we actually give the teachers the tools to deal with bullying? (and fire teachers found to do it themselves)

19744,"Sucks living in Australia, the government feels the need to stick their nose in our fucking business when it comes to our video gaming entertainment experience... fuckin weak."
19745,"why do you people have to blame video game and start blaming your self. ok ok let's just say that some games are violent like grand theft auto and ever since i hate gta when i was about 10 and i ever played ones in my hole life and that day was the day that brain went on town without permission. and let's start playing FIFA cuz it's better then any other shooters game ok but it can't be better then BF4 in battlefield 4 it's much more fun then any games, that i ever had in my ps4 BUT it's better for your brain to relax and stop thinking of being violent. cuz we have a lot of fun playing video games in your daily life."

Then don't join the fucking army."
19748,No shit for #1 because there was a 11 year old boy shot and killed his mother over 20 times after she banned him from call of duty. And Guess what they blame it on? Fucking COD that it and its so BS. only i'm suppressed that team fortress 2 hasn't got any hate on it.

19751,"you always hear them say ""kids play this"" ""kids are becoming violent"" etc... well shouldnt they blame the parents for getting them that game in the first place? the games have age ratings for a reason. 
 
if a parent buys a young kid a violent game even though the rating says 18+ and then complains its too violent, the parent cant blame the game! they have to blame themselves for buying it and allowing their child to play it.
 
i was allowed to watch and play whatever the hell i wanted when i was younger and i could watch any R rated movie when i was around 4 and i'm a pacifist. its not the games fault.
 
(also America should stop legally selling guns.... its kind of scary and i already have really bad paranoia lol)"
19752,"I've never heard of a video game affecting you and making you do things you wouldn't normally do... You make your own decisions, just because you've killed over a thousand people in a virtual video game doesn't automatically mean you'll grow up to be a serial killer. If you choose to be one, then yeah but a virtual game can't predict your future.."
19753,"ok , the US government is concerned about violence in video games when they kill hundreds of people in sirya and irak good :D"
19754,"People need Violence in there games, It helps with the stress and the rage of every day life ( Manly assholes )and if we didn't have it there to mellow us out. All those killings or shootings would look like apick nickcompared to the apocalypse of killing sprees that would wipe out every living asshole that walks this shit hole of a planet. 99% of the worlds population would be decimated inminutes."
19755,Is it just me or when I looked at the thumbnail I saw Lee Everett about to kill Sandra with an axe...
19756,"Mw2  when I first played it, I was very 'weird' playing from a terrorist view. Um, yes I did usually skip it because in the end it was offensive and down right f#%+*## up"
19757,"I remember not killing anyone in ""No Russian"" on MW2"
19758,I can understand how the games get controversies but it's psycotic if ppl blame them for real life shootings
19759,"no! Video Games do NOT make kids violent. I know this one kid who doesnt play violent games and he's a complete psycho, and he would always tell me his parents ignore him. And I know plenty of other kids who've been playing rated M games since they're fricking 7, and they have a great sense of right and wrong because their parents raised them well. It all comes down to the parenting..."
19760,Get over it it's just a game
19761,10: (2) You can play as a woman in Mass Effect... failure to highlight this on the video makes me sad :(
19762,3:43 hey look its Kim!! :D
19763,i think they should just stop selling guns and sell tasers instead for tasers can only kill people that have heart condition
19764,In the UK we have pegi who called goat simulator a 16
19765,"Say what they say,the videogames still exist and there still coming up more and more
Whatever they say,they will not afect the industry,fuckin news chanels"
19766,I agree I have mental problems I play all the violent games but it dosent make me want to go out killing people
19767,"Oh god, I did not hear about some of these and as soon as I heard them I knew Fox ""news"" would have a field day."
19768,its not games its just there not ok or right in the head not to be mean
19769,I think that parents blame on videogames instead of recognize that they're not good parents
19770,"Ha, a lot of fox news here. Big shock there."
19771,"Yeah, because guns and mental illness dont kill......oh but video games do! 
Fuck these guys what do they know about video games they are too busy blaming everything but guns in our own country"
19772,how about the uslearns to not take shit seriously its a game you don't have to o do it in real life stupid americans
19773,i would totally put there god of war
19774,"Screw the public news media, god damn scumbags just want a slice of the money and pull off bullshit lawsuits
Remember when people on purpose spilled hot coffee on themselves at MC Donalds and then sue the company, Or fat people stuffing themselves with junk then want to sue fast foods?
NEVER trust the corrupted media because all it does is promote censorship and bullshit, use your own mind, theorize, research"
19775,"I'm so tired of hearing about how violent video games cause real life violence. I play violent video games and it doesn't make me want to go on a rampage like Trevor in gta 5. I use video games as an escape from reality. It's fun to relax and play them with friends. I bet these same people crying about video games watch violent TV shows or movies. Also to parents that complain, don't you look at the ratings before you buy? My parents always looked at the ratings before buying me any game."
19776,LEAGUE OF LEGENDS OMFG ITS SO ADDICTIVE
19777,Also Australian businesses started taking GTA V off shelves -_-
19778,"Brb. Gotta go play GTA V then relentlessly murder my family, hijack a car, pimp the ever-living fuck out of it, then go plow people on the side of the street, get chased by cops, get out of the car with a minigun thinking imma pro and take a bullet to the face and DIE!!!!!!"
19779,"You know what I think, I think that the government and the media can suck each others dicks because at least that would get them to shut up long enough for an enjoyable video game to be made. I played man hunt and I laughed at every kill scene because its a GAME not real life."
19780,"Lol, #10 is like: ""Hey, we criticise porn for giving a non-realistic image of sex"" and then they basically go out and whine about this stuff being ""Too realistic."" Damn, people! Let them have their sexy-times. Who gives a shit about what someone else is wanking to? What's wrong with sexy stuff? Do we live in a world where everyone needs to force their view of what is normal and what's not up everyone's ass? That's like... Chinese censorship."
19781,a lot of fox news
19782,I hate the press
19783,i like russia and the no russian mission problem
19784,"That Six Days in Fallujah debacle was complete bullshit, and that news anchor should be ashamed of herself."

19786,Funny how Rockstar couldn't care less about these whiny assholes.
19787,The people blaming video games for killing sprees and shit are stupid a lot of people play video games if it's the video games fault everyone would be killing each other The older generation blames everything on video games because it's apparently to bloody or something and also did you know that people that play videos usually have a higher reaction than people who don't
19788,"What I'd like to know is if video games are the cause of violence, what fucking game has the entire human race been playing the past thousand years?"
19789,"What the fuck is up with these people. "" Ohh you cant make that game because my dad died or brother"". I mean seriously are these guys for real. Video games are made for fun, It's made for you to enjoy doing something you cant do in real life. Whats wrong with seeing nipples, I see mine every time i take shower."
19790,"I think it's naive to solely place the blame on video games for the violence that exists in our society. I've played video games all my life, and I can see how games like GTA and COD can desensitize people to violence, especially when they begin playing at an early age, but it doesn't start or end there. What about the violent history the U.S. possesses? What about all the violent films that get pumped out every year? What about all the violent programming on the television? What about the U.S. governments obsession with war? What about how broken the gun-purchasing system is in the U.S? I think that the biggest problem is that people aren't taught how to communicate their anger/emotions, or simply aren't listened to, and that's when they turn to violence. Video games are just a scapegoat, and blaming them is an easy way to wash your hands."
19791,Notice how it's always fox that's the most extreme
19792,Then what the fuck games where they playing thousands of years ago that had virtual guns?
19793,I get a kick out of the fact that fallout 3 or NV were not on here considering that you can kill someone that cut off all of their limbs. But then again no body got butthurt over it.
19794,"This all makes me mad,because if the parents let their kids play higher rated games like a 9 year old playing a M rated game, then the kid does something bad because of this then its the parents fault right?"
19795,Portal 2 makes fun of being adopted. Bullshit. Valve did that so Chell wouldn't need a last name.
19796,"I have been playing video games my whole life i remember the first game i played was Gta:San Andreas with my older brother i was 6 and i never had a thought of going outside and killing a bunch of cops all 4 of my brothers and sisters grew up playing violent video games war games racing games etc , and we all grew up just fine video games aren't the problem how a person was raised or mental problems is the problem well that's my opinion were all entitled to one."
19797,I like how all the clips are fox news
19798,"I want to hate this channel for being click bait but the videos are inoffensive, often informative, and lacks any of the ""extreme"" or ""in your face!"" dreck of similar presentations."

19800,"Ok, so one mentally unstable punk who never touched a console before grabs a gun and starts shooting people. A guy makes reference to a video game. Everywhere you hear afterwards is that's the fault of video games. Screw logic."
19801,Deam pepole will not understand tht its just a game
19802,"Of course, let the US continue legally selling guns.
Let them scam shit to get every single cent from the media.
They are so respectful and fancy, they should demonstrate it by throwing another nuke on people the don't like.
US is certainly the best!

19805,"Heres the thibg, I'd fight and kill to defend that wich stops me from fighting and killing, controversial yes, looking at it the American way its satanic and evil and some other bullshit to keep the country scared and under thier satanic and evil rule,  y'see the problem, its America, took me a while but if we get invaded by extra terestrial lifem the tanjs are dead, deader than dead, so dead it nakes the dinosaurs pop up again"
19806,I fucking hate how they put video games on blast just cuz some guy that played it killed someone. I mean what if they had a mental illness or they weren't normal. Like what the fuck.

19811,"1: Video games, shouldn't be Banned or Censored just because of Parents or governments, that's plain stupid. If you don't want YOUR Child/children playing super violent games. Don't Buy The Game For Them. simple as that.
2: People will always seek to Blame something, the fact of the matter is these morons, mental or not, made the conscious choice to shoot a real gun at people, they can say all the bullshit about how it's a games fault till the angels behead them, it's just a stupid excuse of people who try to run away from their stupid choices.
I'm a guy who grew up around violent and often gory video games, and I own quite a few of them too. all I've learned from them, is how to say words and spell em, even if my parents would rather I never have learned them to begin with. As a kid, I played games like Mortal Kombat and Tekkan, ALOT, it was either those games or donkey kong country. I also watched a lot of horror movies like Aliens and Chucky. Here I am, as an adult, still watching those movies, and playing even more graphic games, like Prototype 2, Saints Row ect. And the most Violent I've ever been in my entire life was a brief fight with my childhood friend, only damage resulted from that was my broken lunchbox way back in middle school.
Some of my most favorite characters in games and shows, are the violent ones. Alex and James from Prototype, Tiny Tina from Border Lands, Jackie Estacado from The Darkness, and all the monsters from Resident Evil. Pyramid Head from Silent Hill, Alucard from Hellsing."
19812,"Btw, Socially Conservative = Complete Idiot with Dogmatic Thinking."
19813,"""Games can be addictive and psychologically damaging"". If you know anything about the psycho-dynamic effects of games, you'd know that they are the exact opposite of psychologically damaging. Video Game Violence actually provides a kind of release for violent tendencies and the frustration you receive from difficult games could be a factor in making you less stress prone.
On the other hand, we have to be thankful for Fox News, because even though you can't know what's true from watching it, you can at least know what's total bullshit and how to avoid it."
19814,"| The 1. Most Controversial Topic: Allegations to Mass Shootings. |
What happens in a shooting when a teenager kills innocent people it is because he expressed anger on people that were not involved with it. They also blame it on video games despite the fact it depends on how stable the mind is of the user playing this game. The real reason why people go on massacres and kill innocent people is because their minds are unstable as fuck. Caused by bullies and people who tease and think 'Eh, its nothing.' Don't blame video games because they look like they intend users to go kill others. Its a waste of time."
19815,"I'm Australian and I brought Watch Dogs one day and the chick behind the counter had to ask if I was 18 or over, I said no, so I had to get my mum to come over to say it was alright I could buy it. After playing a mer 3 minutes of the game I now understand why it's 18+"

19821,"Lol, it would be fox news pushing this forward."
19822,"OK people say ""First-person shooters make people violent! They need to be BANNED!!!"" Based on that logic are you saying cooking mama makes me a great cook? Are you saying GTA will make me want to run around doing absolutely nothing? Are you saying that Doctor Who: The Adventure Games will make me a two-hearted alien with a police box thats bigger on the inside and travels through time and space? Think about what you say before you say it. It just logic and common sense. Oh and the ""Hot coffee MOD"" was just literally a MOD that people could DOWNLOAD. Yes sure it was taken from code in the game that WAS TAKING OUT BEFORE RELEASE! Gosh people are stupid. And besides ITS A GAME ANYWAY. So calm your tits news anchors and parents and politicians."
19823,Is it bad that No Russian was my favorite mission in Call of Duty?
19824,"This is exactly why i hate those dicks who say violent games make people violent, they always blame videogames. Sure, its legal to sell guns, but to shoot virtual people, who don't share emotion with you, is considered a controversy. HOW IN THE BLOODY SHITTING WORLD IS SHOOTING OR KILLING A CHARACTER MADE OF PIXELS OR POLYGONS MAKING PEOPLE VIOLENT? HALF MY FRIENDS OWN ALL THE MODERN WARFARE GAMES, BLACK OPS 1 AND 2, GTA 4 AND 5, AND THEY ARE ALL 13/14 YEARS OLD! HELL, I PLAYED MORTAL KOMBAT 2 WHEN I WAS 6!!! MY BROTHER, WHO IS 6 NOW, FUCKING LOVES MK2, 3, AND 9!!!!! AND GUESS WHAT, THEY HAVE NEVER, EVER HARMED A SINGLE PERSON. IN. THEIR. ENTIRE. FUCKING. LIVES. Rant over, needed to get some rage out."

It's completely false of course but it still didn't stop them from calling it ""Ordinary nazism"" maybe not as ridiculous as one who proposed a age-rating classification of video-games, she was only ten years late. So rejoice we all have politicians who blame videogames for the problems in society they're responsible even if they don't know jack about it."

19843,Mw2 the no Russian mission u could skip in the beginning of said mission and as soon as u start the game for the first time it asks u if u want to do the mission or not and all those games are just tht games people over react over the slightest things GTA is a game of violence like SR and cod if people don't like it then don't buy it plan and simple
19844,"as a kid i sad fuck these people , people can choose to do what they want and they can choose not to pick up a gun like in the games. but as an adult with kids of my own i realize that games changes the way people think, saying how everyone thinks its ok to people head to explode but not ok to see like 5 secs of tits, to the average man he should be able to eventually get married make sweet love to his wife but he should never have to rip someones eye sockets out,  literally almost everyone i know personally and people of the world think its ok to show extreme violence but not ok to see nudity, then my friends ask me what if my son walks into the room which would i rather him see, i would rather him see porn because he will eventually have a girl friend and do those things with her, over violence, i never want him to take a chainsaw and ram it into some ones chest, (gears of war), so yes video games do change people"

19848,these people scare the shit out of me. they influence sheeple and they think they're correct. mainly religious conservative nutcases
19849,"Reminds me of a debate I had in Current Events in high school. We were talking about violence in video games and if/how they affect people in real life (possible shootings, outbursts of violence, etc.) My teacher leaned more towards the side of instead of blaming the video games, look at what else the person was exposed to, while one girl in my class quickly interjected just to ban all video games in general.
""They're of no benefit, bad for you, and cause violence. So they should all be banned."" Me, being a female gamer, gave my two cents. I argued that this was not the case, as there are other factors behind violence as well as beneficial effects that come from video games. When she disagreed with me again, I said this: ""Well, what about horses? (she was a MAJOR horse lover) they've hurt people, why don't we just ban people from riding them altogether? That's what you're arguing for.""
She was silent XD"
19850,"Gta isn't really bad, it's just like pretty much a violent movie about the life of crime , the game is basically a life of crime , it doesn't tell you to go out and shoot a load of people , people don't complain about films all the time , and gta gives u choices to do fun legal stuf also"
19851,Hatred anyone?
19852,meh all of these I felt nothing. some of these I even felt very boring like manhunt 2 and it does not affect me at all. Those medias love exaggerating stuffs

Consider South Korea, where the Women's Administration bans porn because it thinks it 'leads to rape,' actually makes game companies stop service to kids after 10, and force-closes games after two hours of gameplay.

19856,when Abraham Lincoln was assassinated he was SHOT with a GUN in the 17-1800's before videogames were invented!
19857,It's so strange how many bleeding hearts we have in our governments... No wonder they're boring.
19858,I hate Grand Theft Auto. That is such a violent game and I will never date any guy that plays that game.
19859,"I like how these games are problematic but Sons of Anarchy is perfectly acceptable. Please don't attempt to feed me this BS that SoA came on after hours, whatever that means.
I personally am not into 1st person shooters, but to say that mass shooters are tied to these types of games is about is ridiculous as saying the next dictator probably drinks water, therefore water is the cause. Before you furl your brows and begin composing hatred infused remarks, consider this. The rise in virtual gaming over the past couple of decades suggests that most kids around the world are playing virtual games on some device, whether it be a console or a pc. In other words, it is highly likely that all murders have played a video game, but it is unlikely that gamers have killed someone. The argument is just flawed. Murder has existed since the beginning of humanity, as did mass murder (I study history for a living). It isn't like CoD came out and suddenly the murder rate went from 1 person per year to 200k. No, high murder rates existed well before gaming systems. Kent State, etc."
19860,ITS A TRAP!!!!
19861,I laughed when he said MW2 was very realistic

19864,"Aaaahhhh, United-States, Indeed, it is so much easier to blame video game then actually see the real problem.

19872,"Ive been playing shooters since i was six, when i got cod 4. Ever since, ive been loving shooters. I dont really care about who or what i kill in a videogame, as i will never kill unless i absolutely have to in real life. All this talk on how videogames influence shootings is bullshit in my opinion. Its not the videogames that trigger that killer instinct, they already have mental conditions. Hell i could shoot each president of the world in the head one by one in a videogame, because i know i will never do it in real life."
19873,"It's entertaining watching the political idiots make utter fools of themselves trying to make bank from popular controversy over...games! LOL
A ten year old child can tell the difference between a game and reality, too abd these so-called adults cannot."
19874,"Why ""conservative media""? I usually hear MSNBC and CCN harp about videogame violence these days, them and the morning chat shows on EVERY news station regardless of political alignment (you know, the guys and gals with the fake smiles, giant coffee cups, plush chairs, etc).
I hate to say it it but that comment sticks out to me...
I remember when conservative politicians and media reps got down on videogames in the 90s, it was awful, but it is the past. For the last decade or so most of the complaints and manufactured controversies come from the Huffington Post, liberal activist groups, and grassroots ignorance spread through Facebook. Sure there are some biblethumpers on the fringe, but nobody listens to them.
If you're going to point a finger, point the right finger."

19879,six days in felujah should have been kickstarted (err... kickfinished?)after konami bailed. it deserves to be made
19880,"While I don't agree that video games are the main cause of all these mass shootings, I do believe that games sometimes cross the line in terms of what is too disturbing or violent. I can't see how someone would enjoy slaughtering hundreds of innocent civilians in an airport in a video game."
19881,"Video games are Awsome,that's that."
19882,Blaming video games for all of our shootings is easy the news medias just don't care about the truth if it's a topic to talk about they will talk about it and if they have to lie to get ratings they will not hesitate
19883,"Lee Harvey Oswald played Sniper Elite just hours before shooting JFK.
Adolf Hitler played the ""No Russian"" level on COD: Modern Warfare 2, and asked himself that if he replaced the Civilians with Jews, if he too could rise to power."

19887,"Hey, guys. I'm going to pretend to be a government official.
""Someone's being violent or breaking the law? Why don't we blame it on video games for no real reason and RUIN THEM FOR EVERYONE ELSE.""
Why can't we just focus on fixing the problem instead of blaming it on something you don't like because you can, in the hopes of getting everyone else to dislike it, too? It doesn't help anyone to ban video games that state they're designed for mature audiences."
19888,"Here's the thing about all these idiotic controversies. The right to bear arms was instilled into the Constitution because of fear of King George III's navy/army/whatever invading the 13 Colonies before they became independent, back when colonialism was a big thing.
Even after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, no one wants to abolish that policy - and it's not gonna be happening anytime soon, considering that Republicans have taken over our Senate, and the majority of Republican politicians are rich, greedy, Christian, white supremacist, conservative (which highly values the right to bear arms because of property-related stuff) assholes. Since, unfortunately, these people have a lot of money (you've probably heard the saying money is power), they can drive the media to blame mass shootings on violent video games in order to keep that policy in tact. (Quick edit and fun fact... of sorts) A huge multitude of people actually follow these beliefs.
Of course, considering the era of complete idiocy this country is in, they'll fight back, no matter how much scientific evidence is brought up on their faces.
A little side note, Fox News is a huge conservative shithole that literally brainwashes people and can and will make stuff up in order to attract their viewers. Additionally, Fox and any news channel affiliated with it can, and will, hire femnazis to report stuff and interview people.
That's how backward the politics and media in this country are."
19889,"pretty much all of them are bull except the COD no russian level, that shit was fucked up and should not have been made"
19890,7:42 Since when do US Police Dogs get to wear Body Armor and a badge??? :-s
19891,"Mom buys a game that says parental warning or 18+ to 5 years old
she lets him play and she was like OH MA GOD ITS VIOLLEEENNCEE BLAME THE PROGRAMMERS
Blame yourselfs assholes it says the rating for a fucking reason."
19892,"I don't see why people say ""Video games mess with people"" when those shooters could just be killers."
19893,Man fuck the media how u worry about the government and not us n are games and guns
19894,"MK and GTA are great games. In fact, if they're isn't any controversy about a game, then it might not be a good game."
19895,I love how all the clips are from Fox News
19896,Wait until Hatred comes out.
19897,"what america thought.""Hmm a mass murder,I wonder why it was caused, it cant be because we sell guns in most stores, It must be Video Games!!!!"
19898,"Can't believe they didnt mention the game Thrill Kill. I wanted that game so bad, they hyped it up in magazines, i had a poster of it and memory card stickers, then they cancelled its US release. It was a 4 player fighting game where you played as dead people who had been sent to hell, and could dismember each other and stuff."
19899,Where's RapeLay?
19900,"Ugh, you damn conservatives."
19901,It:s 06:22 am and I have to be in universtiy at 8... I should take a nap.
19902,Number One is spot on. People need to stop trying to blame video games for something as tragic as mass shootings.
19903,"I swear to god video games will be made illegal because a couple of social outcasts get a hold of firearms and use them on their peers. It's FUCKED UP! Anybody recall this happening in such I frequency in the 90's or 80's? People had control then, they weren't slaves to technology like we are today."
19904,"Which one pisses you off the most?, ALL OF THEM SAYS GAMERS EVERYWHERE!"
19905,Anita Sarkeesian is involved in the development of Mirror's edge 2.
19906,#1 GEARS OF HALO THEFT AUTO 5! Haha I miss halo 3 machinma so much.
19907,"I would have liked to seen a video game based on real life events, like Six Days in Fallujah. I don't laugh at scenes where people are massacred or killed. I care about the NPCs. It's like making a movie for gods sake."
19908,Pokemon is about witchcraft lol. The guy obviously has never even seen it being played.
19909,Make a top ten batman actors
19910,"Just a bunch of fat lesbians and damn conservatives who have nothing better to do. The only thing that I found to be slightly fucked up was physically emulating a stab in Manhunt. From there, everything was kick ass and cool."
19911,"Guns don't kill people, video games kill people"
19912,"I hate how people are such prudes today, they get offended over everything. You literally cannot do anything without offending without offending an entire group of people. People need to remove the sticks from their asses and relax for once."
19913,WOW!!! The Press and Government are total IDIOTS!!! I mean sure there are alot of shootings but blaming them on a video game EVERY SINGLE FUCKING TIME IS RIDICULOUS!!!! If someones gonna shoot somebody their gonna do it because their insane and Fucked up in the head. Not because of a video game. I do agree that manhunt and CoD MW2 have disturbing and gruesome moments but instead of banning or boycotting the game JUST DONT PLAY IT!!!
19914,"4:29 Dat fact that Project Reality has a level in Fallujah.
This is why we shouldn't bother with publishers.
Star Citizen. That is all."
19915,0:18 hey fox news that already exist its called a ESRB rating I hate that controversy SO much.
19916,"I dislike how every school shooting has to be about the kid playing a violent video game. Because clearly that video game showed them how to get a gun, and who to kill in the form of a mission or quest or whatever. But the media just EAT it up! Makes me wish that their ancestors evolved into a different species."
19917,The media are idiots I'm a non violent person because I play video games
19918,"If you would do a violent act in real life it had nothing to do with the video game, you had problems to begin with."
19919,"8:22 ""You are projecting other cases on to this case. You are projecting what he was doing four or five years ago on to what he was doing this weekend.""
Omg. That takedown."
19920,"Republican dicks get their knickers in a twist about anything (apart from the bible telling them to kill homosexuals of course, that's perfectly OK...)"
19921,Blame the virtual gun when you're using the real one to kill real humans.That's really smart.
19922,How did I know the No Russian mission was gonna be on here.
19923,"The reason murdering people and trashing places is so fun in video games is precisely because you CANT get away with it in real life. It provides a nice, safe opportunity to pillage your local neighborhood and cause mayhem without actually hurting anyone or just lamely wondering what it might feel like."
19924,Australia sucks when it comes to games... its not fair
19925,I think that your mother is fat and stupid
19926,People drive me insane
19927,Stop fucking blaming everything on video games. My fucking God. It's just a game it's not intended to be real. If your kids don't understand if it's real tell them that's it's not real life. I'm sorry but most of the fucking adults can you please stop blaming video games. It's not real life. You don't have to go that far with Pokemon where you said it shows your kids how to use witch craft. How much stupider can your reason can get. It's not intended to be like that. Just had to let my emotions.
19928,"It's total bull that by playing virtual shooting games, people will want to go out and shoot people for real. A lot of people play shooting games, and not everyone of them go out to purchase a gun to hurt others. However, I have to say if a real gun were to fall into the hands of a mentally sick person, or a person who is immoral, then it would be a high risk for other people's safety. But then again, parents are looking to blame when sometimes its an act of neglect on their part. (note I said sometimes). This would be a rather interesting discussion."
19929,"Yeah, if the violence is in movies, its ok, but if its in video games, thats where people draw the line, makes sense to me.
P.S.: Screw anti game activists, compilation of idiocy the lot of them."
19930,Gosh I hate the US government. They never take the blame for anything. Thy need to actually do some work. The reason terrorists haven't assassinated the president in a while is because the president is already ruining the country.
19931,"Here's a thought America, maybe instead of allowing these games to be made, but making guns more than accessible, why don't you allow the games and stop fucking selling the bloody guns, it actually hurts my brain when video games get called out, when you have A LAW THAT LETS YOU BUY A FUCKING GUN!!!!!"
19932,People are to fuckingsensitive.
19933,"So, GTA promotes violence and torture?
Shit, better uninstal GTA and get back to Punisher.
Also, cough*postal*cough"
19934,"Its Funny, in Britian we have no gun laws but we do allow to have all these video games. It does prove that if you take the guns away from real life you will have non of these high school masscares and what not but also we can blame the parnets for playing the game and buying it for them."
19935,Wait for HATRED...
19936,"and to think, only a year later, the most controversial game is going to come out. Rage. YOU PLAY AS A GUY WHO GOES AND A MASS SHOOTING SPREE"
19937,the australian banning is bullshit
19938,i had a woman tell me once that gta was a plague against child innocence i then asked her if she thought it was right to let a young child to watch an R rated movie she said no i then explained to her that M rated games are for people 17 and up and are on the same line as an R rated movie and any parent that ignores that is stupid to get mad at the video game she then exploded with rage that i said something logical and cussed me out to the point she was thrown out of the store we were in
19939,"there was ""realistic"" sex scene in Mafia long before Mass Effect. (and long after Custer's Revenge :P )
. Lot of fuss over nothing."
19940,I think these people who think video games are bad are stupid because if you are mentally ill then get help if it might hurt other people what those shooter did was tragic but not because of video games did those shooting happen
19941,HATRED!
19942,Screw FOX News they suck
19943,"1)Pokmon is witchcraft? Here's some advice: Knowthe topic you'retalking about before you attack it.
2)I play Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty, and I'm not a killer. People who say that games cause violence in the real world need to shut up. I cannot tell you how pissed I get when I hear people saying that games cause violence. People cause violence, not games."
19944,GODDAMN IT WHERE IS LAVANDER TOWN
19945,I know it's sad when people die but why blame it on a game?
19946,Gotta love Fox News.
19947,"One of those days I was waiting in the line at the supermarket when I overheard this conversation between two old ladies. t was something like this: ""...and then she discovered that her son was playing those games late at night. Satanic games, just like the ones that those serial killers play, with guns, killing people and everything."""
19948,Ed Boon has dealt with the medias collective shit for so long he just doesn't care seriously MK has been going strong for long now it's like it's invincible.
19949,fox news just likes to spew shit all over the place
19950,8:53what she was saying is trueim guessing about 94 out of every 100 people was not influenced by a video game when they killed dozens of others
19951,"In all honesty, anyone who has the desire to play that level in which you shoot and kill all those people in that airport probably needs psychiatric help if they don't feel disturbed in the slightest while doing it. Just watching it made me uneasy and sorrowful."
19952,Hatred
19953,"Ugh, just give it time. The exact same thing happened with comics and movies. We just laugh about the comic book hate right now, right? We'll laugh about the game hate in 10 years."
19954,They blame video games because it is easier to attack a physical thing than to solve mental illness
19955,This shit always cracks me up
19956,People are pussies.
19957,This americans.... they are so worried about sex scenes and for them its normal can carry a gun at the same time you are walking or seeing one film hahahahahahaha
19958,It's kind of sad that the majority of the AAA action titles that come out are made by such psychos who have no limits of what to leave out in a game and what to keep.
19959,whats the game with the chainsaw
19960,Who's the person in Florida?
19961,WBTV!!!!!!! NO WAY
19962,"blah blah games are violent, go home and watch rambo and delta force lol"
19963,"That last lady nailed it. We have a huge problem in the US with mental health. All of the money being thrown around by our government to ""fix"" our problems could better be spent doing something about this core issue. Not gun control & blame games.
Whoops. I guess that I already wrote something similar about this 7 months ago. No more Internet for me today."
19964,"No Rapelay? I thought for sure that would be here.
Still though politicians and moral activists are such idiots. It never fails, every time something new comes out that the younger generation heavily invests in suddenly becomes the root of all evil. Like Rock n' Roll music, ever see the old videos with parents and politicians claiming it was ""the devil's music"" and led to ""immoral behavior?"" Honestly if the lack of common sense among the general population weren't so sad it would be laughable."
19965,Modern warfare 2....you have the option to do that scene or not
19966,"Scientifically speaking, you can blame all those mass shootings on the construction of the brains of those who do those kinds of horrendous acts... There's a part in the brain called amygdala that triggers fear and controls some necessary emotional responses.... People who commit delirious crimes where they show little or no conscience or fear at all are shown to have small amygdala.. making them prone to empathy.. There are so many things to look upon..."
19967,fox is a bunch of idiots
19968,Umm what about movies? like fight club or tv shows like tom and jerry?
19969,"I have to side with the press on man hunt and six days, although I think they should have still been released unrated. As with six days, it was set to be a survival horror game and was apparently (from pre-release reviews) genuinely scary and disturbing at times, which it should have been, art represents not only the happiness in the world, but also whats dark, and scary, and I strongly believe games are on art form."
19970,Maybe because people lost their children in that battle. So every other war game based on real events where people obviously died should be pulled and we should act like those events never happened? Too much logic Fox News? Okay.
19971,ive killed more people in video games than the number of pennies in bill gates's bank account. yet i would never kill someone unless it is in the case of self defence and i would try and temporarily knock them out or dicapitate them.
19972,Very biased against conservatives
19973,"My gosh, I never realized how the news and bloggers not realize it's just freaking games! Except the war game one, that is serious. And the russian COD thing, plus the mass shooting one."
19974,I wish more people would be like the lady in the last clip. Just some common sense would be nice for once.
19975,most people who play those games don't do anything that violent.
19976,FUCK FOX NEWS THOSE BIASED FUCKING BUTTHURT BITCHES
19977,Mw2 is a cod 1 of the most popular franchises ever if it was in a low budget game i bet the media wouldnt give a shit
19978,"Few things piss me off more than a bunch of conservatives blaming violent video games (or video games in general) for things like murder, mass shootings, rape, arson, anarchy, and other violent acts. Now, I won't say what most unrealistic defenders of the gaming industry would say, which is, ""Playing a game where you routinely kill or maim people, like Grand Theft Auto, would in no way make someone want to commit those acts in real life.""
The fact of the matter is, there are more than enough people on Earth that the possibility for a game to spark violent acts is certainly possible, since for some people, something as small as getting cut off on the drive home from work can inadvertently cause a man or woman to violently beat their spouse to death and drown their children before running through town naked with a spousal skin-mask on. However, history and scientific studies have shown with tangible proof that the motivation for violent acts is rarely -- if ever -- directly connected to video games, or gaming in general. It's not impossible, because there ARE people out there that are mentally unstable enough to be swayed by something like a video game, but it is extremely unlikely.
Furthermore, people need to understand that anything that's popular -- whether it be a dance, a game, a new fashion, or even a new idea -- ALWAYS meets with controversy often. The controversy and debate over video games is never going to end, because the people who adamantly believe they're to blame for the world's problems are still breeding and teaching their kids those same misguided morals."
19979,postal is not on the list!?
19980,All of this is shit its just depends on how stable the person is and if they are smart enough to tell whats fake and whats real...
19981,Saying that a game in which you kill demons and save the universe is Satanic is as dumb as attacking a game that's about history.
19982,I'm playing shooter games for fun not for training for my evil revenge...
19983,"This qualifies as one of those ""slow day news"" but... a kid brought a gun to school and the father blamed the ""zombie-shooting game"" of... fucking Minecraft.
I don't even play Minecraft and yet I can see how full of bullshit that story was."
19984,"What i am thinking with people complaining about games is that they want video games gone. What i say to this is "" Bloody deal with it""."
19985,Gotta love the numerous hits on Fox and Conservatives when the ones responsible for all the regulation of video games are liberal democrats. Hillary Clinton and Joseph Lieberman.
19986,"Horrifying fact!!!!: Everyone who eventually became a mass murderer... at one point in their life... had... a mother... Guys, this shit is fucking crazy... We should ban mothers all over the world, they lead to school shootings."
19987,"I wonder why pepole are such pussies over games. Why call of duty is the responsible for carnages, mass shootings and murder? And there seems to be some ""rasism"" over shooters, if a shooter game BARELY shows at least A FUCKING DROP of blood is burned alive by controversy-making ""politicians"", ""congressmen"" and ""pepole who have a 'problem' with it"" while in shooters where BLOOD IS PART OF CHARACTER MODELS are left alone, take an example: Resident Evil, there are flesh-eating zombies EVERYWHERE, monsters made of rotten flesh, and decapitation. And everyone left it alone. I'm not even mentioning Dead Space, (a good amount of survival-horror games i.e. RE are shooters too) and a and that call of duty mission WAS SKIPPABLE AND SAIDNTO BE DISTURBING CONTENT. Infinity Ward didn't wanted controversy, if they did, which i doubt, why there would be that warning? I want all these puss- i mean ""concerned pepole"" to deal with it. It's already done. Shooters and violence are a part of gaming, like safety, realism, and information, so shut the fuck up and get over the goddamn fact that violence exsists in gaming, community and Earth. So shut up."
19988,maybe make it forbidden to buy certain games for kids....and look after gamestores instead of telling them not to sell an 18+ game to a kid of 10. maybe raise the age even. i get sick of kids online anyways. its not for them and they get to become annoying in real life too
19989,E eu vo jogar tds u.u
19990,"If games are to blame for shootings, then please explain the wars on this planet that we face, and the crime that we face. Oh there was a gang shooting in chicago , let's blame videogames and gun control laws for that. It's fucking stupid to blame an inadament object such as a console or a form of firearm for that stuff."
19991,It's funny when people blame videogames 'cause 3/5 parents that does it bought a rated +18 game to their 10-16 years old kid...cough cough call of duty cough
19992,"I got a solution. Kill ""stupid"" people. If your IQ is lower than a 120, you're out. Stupidity fuels all the major issues, and It also harms intellectuals. With an IQ of 120-130, I find that the only way to fight stupidity, is with death. In a society where respect is almost non-existent, violence even not at a physical level can erupt."
19993,I just can't believe some people actually blame things as games for shootings. They know damn sure that if they had no guns so many childeren would have lived but they are just to big of a bunch of dickholes to still allow guns. I wonder if these people would still deny it's guns if their kids got massacerd.
19994,05:28 his random noises tho
19995,"01:10 she should've waited until mass effect 3, then she wouldn't be talking"
19996,"1. There needs to be more fact-based points/evidence in this comments section and less pure opinion. Throwing opinions at other people gets nowhere.
2. It is wrong to think video games are evil. It is also wrong to think they are somehow holy. They are neither as bad the media wants them to look or as good as gamers, both hardcore and casual (like me), want them to look. They're somewhere in the middle.
3. No, kids won't go shooting people because of games. But games will affect them somehow.Like point no. 2, it'spretty blind to say that games are some sort of demon, but also pretty blind to say that shooting up an airport full of people won't affect you somehow, for better or for worse.
4. Not all the countries involved in this listare American. And just a fun fact: America has fairly loose gun control as a country (last time I checked; don't quote me on this), and Australia has pretty strict gun control.
5. Kind of a part of point no. 4. The media likely isn't ignoring guns to blame games. The liberal media is heavily pro gun control (don't start calling me names for that, just do a little Google search), and I doubt they would skip an opportunity to blame guns for violence and crime. But games on face, look pretty darn bad, especially when people involved in tragedies play them a lot. You have a guy who did something horrible, and he ripped people's spines out in Mortal Kombat. Pretty easy to draw a wrong conclusion from that as an uneducated observer.
What's my point (TL;DR)? Take the middle ground. Games aren't necessarily good or bad. The reason for these controversies occurring is not necessarily connectedto a biased media. Finally, games DO look pretty bad to uninformed people."
19997,"5:05 yeah, people will laugh that they got killed on a Video game because it is all fake top them. What happened to your son is sad, but it is in the past."
19998,"The blame game as always been around, for instance when the comic series 'Tales From The Crypt' was around in the forties, parents and senators blamed the harmless comics for juvenile delinquency for its graphic nature. Though it was not the case, but none the less the comic series was later on shut down and all copies burned. I thank god everyday that the one single entertainment I can enjoy isn't being blamed for horror crimes such as terror attacks or mass shootings when blaming something won't solve anything."
19999,"Try to keep your opinions out of your videos please. Your job is to tell the viewers about controversial games, not whether or not they're rightfully controversial."
20000,I played Mario once and got addicted to shrooms.....video games are evil.
20001,"Im gonna say what champchong said. People who play video games dont kill people, crazy people who play video games kill people. And most of those people wouldve killed someone anyways"
20002,"So, what was #1?"
20003,"OH NO!!!
SOME GUY SHOT PEOPLE ON THE STREET!
I KNOW!
LETS BLAME IT ON VIDEO GAMES!"
20004,"Its funny how the redneck guy targeted Pokemon when there are SO many games that are meant to be violent and satanic, but he goes after a cheerful, kid friendly game."
20005,"Wow, about that Pokemon one..... with the redneck priest....
""Entering the world of witchcraft""?
""Teaching them how to cast spells?""
Seriously, those retards need to stop blaming video games for everything kids are doing."
20006,"People of the world! I have an anouncment (sorry if I spelled that wrong)!
Where do all these controversies come from?
America!
Where do all those shootings take place?
America!
Where can you buy a gun without anyone asking what your going to do with it?
America!
Long story short: Its not the fault of the gaming industrie but the fault of the American goverment. If those dumbasses in D.C would do something about the gun laws then guns would be alot more dificult to buy decreasing the change of another shooting in a school or public area. Blaming this on videogames is just plane lazy yes you heard me I called the American goverment lazy! Let this comment be evidence that videogame company's are not the ones to blame."
20007,"Monty Python, much?"
20008,I love how 95% of the news clips of the media being fucks about the games are from Fox News xD what a big surprise they would be the ones to be little sensitive bitches about that stuff.
20009,"All these controversies are bullshit, games dont cause people to kill people, they dont make people do bad things and FOR FUCKS SAKE....PARENTS If you dont want your kid seein this shit then dont let them play or watch it, get of your lazy ass and parent your kids!!"
20010,portal was on the news?!
20011,"What about Final Fantasy? I love the series but I get to be a magic casting, claymore wielding, potions master who fights demons and people, saving the world with crystals of magic. Does this teach me to enter the world of witchcraft? Nope, I'm still no closer to achieving world domination by using my mind. I did however learn that holy water seems to repel omens, sickness, and demons...so props to ya Sony"
20012,"I laugh when they say that a killer killed people Because of video games wake up people it's mental illness, Not Video Games"
20013,The guy in San Andreas looked like Mr. T
20014,"think of it this way if we didn't have video games they would blame movies, if we didn't have movies they would blame music, if we did't have music they would blame kids going out side. so i guess what im saying is look into the persons background before you go and blame it on something that you don't like like games,music and movies and just maybe it might be that the person just has mental problems or was abused as a kid like was rapped or beaten by is parents for the slightest falt"
20015,"this whole thing is fucking stupid, like i forget the name but there was a game about WW1 or WWII i forget and there backing didnt get pulled"
20016,"those pokemon haters need to grow the fuck up, especially peta and that backward ass priest witch craft come the fuck on, actually he doesnt even do any magic the animals do"
20017,Forgot about polybius
20018,Was that Fred Phelps from the Westboro Baptist Church condemning the Pokmon games?  Why would that lame brain think those games taught witchcraft to kids?  This is no witchcraft in Pokmon!  It's not real!  (No offense to any Pokmon fans.)
20019,relax its GAMES... jeez. there will ALWAYS be crazy people games/movies or not.
20020,I bet the ONLY goddamn reason why he hates video games is because he never fucking played them.
20021,"Fuck FOX news, they are fucking idiots. Also Fuck Kevin McMullen, you dumb motherfucker
I'm tucking done.."
20022,"All of these made me so fucking angry. If something offends you, don't fucking go near it. If you don't want something to be played by your kids, DON'T LET YOUR KIDS PLAY THEM! Don't ruin the experience for everyone else who is sane enough to know that what happens in a fucking game should not be replicated in real life. For goodness sake, I play COD and Halo, and GTA. I don't want to join the army or run someone over in a car they bought with their own fucking money. And as for Fox, they need to be shown where they can stick their fear mongering bullshit. It's ridiculous. LET THE GAMING WORLD ENJOY THEIR FUCKING GAMES YA CUNTS!"
20023,"Oh my god... people are SO STUPID to think that video games are the blame for violence! Video games TEACH YOU things. Above all, they teach you not be stupid enough to REPEAT THE SAME ACTIONS displayed in the games themselves! YOU PEOPLE ARE INSANE!"
20024,"Really? Bad thing happens.  Friends say he/she played cod.  OMG VIDEOGAMES MUST BE BANNED FOREVER!!!! What about cartoons? Cartoons these days involve way too much violence.  For example tom & Jerry.  Thats all about a cat trying to murder a mouse!  (Ryan higa reference)
Why dont people blame those?! Why its always videogames? IN USA YOU CAN BUY AN 50. CAL ANTIMATERIAL RIFLE, but you Cant drink alcohol. Lets make you have a mental health test if you try to buy a firearm.  Thats gonna solve everything."
20025,"Ban the fake guns, keep the real ones. Makes sense."
20026,Always Fox who picks up on these things (at least of what we can see in this clip).
20027,"Funny, the people for outlawing virtual guns are against outlawing real guns. Because who gives a shit about logic?"
20028,How many video games addicts haven't even harmed anyone though? I expect It's at least in the millions. It's the people trying to take the blame off of themselves by accusing the video games. It's the person (and the very stupid right to bear arms) not the game.
20029,"I don't know why the word 'conservative' is brought up so much here, when super-liberals seem to be the biggest voices against video games. Thompson, Clinton, Lieberman, and all the bay area hipsters that have been showing up lately (Sarkeesian for instance) have had a lot of success in censoring, attacking, and slandering the community and industry."
20030,what game is at 3:25?
20031,That mass shooting thing only happens in america but people play games around the world
20032,"those people are making a living criticizing video games. Just like Anita Bitch Sarkeesian, it's about the money. all you need is a big mouth and stupid people who supports you."
20033,this next generation of us and our kids will be A HELL OF ALOT BETTER
20034,"the whole video games cause people to get violent is complete bullshit. The way I see it if Im mad then I can go to halo or something and vent my frustration on a bunch of stupid dumbasses following a religion that they believe to be true(whatever right?) But lead by corrupt leaders(typical ya know) and then I can take joy in kickin Allan ass and taking alian names while taking joy in not actually killing anyone 
The only thing that cause people to get violent is.... I can't answer that but it is absolutely fuckin not video games"
20035,pokemon is a world of the demonic? I can't believe people so delusional exist and have power... that old man needs to be reeducated
20036,the only thing that pisses me off is the people that complain no-stop
20037,Them getting all pissed off and cancelling 6 Days in Fallujah was complete bullshit. My cousin was in that battle and he wanted it out as did many other Marines.
20038,"yooo.. I remember that CoD mission, playing it for the first time, I was like.... WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS, I did not want to do that mission at all, I was so disgusted, but it is just a video game.. but the lack of moral in that mission was definitely not enjoyable"
20039,"The fact that this video even has to exist pisses me off why are video games always to blame! What about movies,tv shows,books,etc. they do the exact same thing!"
20040,"It's really disgusting, the amount of hate on gamers. You can't be a female gamer. You can't be antisocial. You can't be introverted. However I really do feel the modern trend of FPS is way too realistic, and does depict human beings killing each other. I tend to play shooters like Star Wars Battlefront and Mass Effect that are science fiction and not actually about mindlessly slaughtering other human beings. I do believe that you should have the freedom to play realistic war games, but you should also accept the fact that many people find such a game distasteful and might judge you for it."
20041,Is that YOGSCAST Kim I see?
20042,"The media knows that games are not the influence for violence. It raises ratings, so the news shamelessly blasts the title of the 'big' story, cold and indifferent to those torn apart by the decisions of one, and slap ""Do games promote violence?"" To bring in the dormant fanatics that live in their delusions of peace and harmony. Video games and those who enjoy them are unfortunately affected by corporations like Faux news, who dedicate their time to corrupting the facts for the gullible. Always do your own research and look to the opinions of those that matter before you fly off on conclusions."
20043,Funny thing me and my buddy talk about this a while back me and him both agree that the only game to even remotely start a killer is twisted metal for those of you who have played the campaign of twisted metal you know what I'm talking about
20044,Correlation does not determine causation. Bloody reporters
20045,fucking hell im stuck here with this no blood no body parts getting ripped off shit for fucking l4d2 fucking stupid but there fuckign Australia for ya well ban games but we wont stop the drug labs :)
20046,Mass shooting = liberals blaming gun ownership and conservatives blaming video games. Both are totally bogus and if you are a part of either community the respective political party does their best to make you look like the devil. welcome to america.
20047,Conkers bad fur day's not on here?
20048,"Speaking as a game programmer - As long as people comprehend that video games are not reality, or even representational of reality, the only real offense is too much shock value - like when kids who have never seen large amounts of blood before watch a horror film - these games are like movies and should be treated as such - there were copycat murders after nightmare on elm street came out (still a celebrated slasher flick) - playing villainous characters shouldn't mean behavior that is desirable to emulate - psychology experts tend to read too much into what may be subconscious tendencies and influences of a person, ignoring every healthy person's free will aspect. -- You'd think that Christians would love a game where you shoot demons all day (Doom). lol"
20049,Don't censor headripping and cutting people up with blades. But titties and sex! That's unthinkable!
20050,"Ok, I'm not stupid when it comes to symbols and stuff being hidden in plain sight or hidden messgaes in things such as video games. But trying to accuse Pokemon of teaching kids ""WITCHCRAFT""?! Just because they use spells and potions? 
Wow, I mean I'm not a Pokemon fan but that's really scraping the barrel."
20051,"If it was ever true that videogames promote violence, then we would have had a hell like more shooting and violence being told on the news. Videogames are initially meant for fun, but several game designers tend to try and push the envelope and walk around the rules to get what they want. Plus,the same people who made Manhunt also made Grand Theft Auto, and I know a lot of people like to play that game. Also, if a gamer ever does become violent and homicidal, it is not the game that is to blame, but the gamer himself/herself.
What does influence violence is the real shit. Like the Sandy Hook shooting. After that incident, there has been a much larger mass of other shooting going on around the country. That was real. Videogames aren't."
20052,Paducah heath shooting.
20053,It is really annoying when people get on a rant or a war on content because they are only aware of it from word of mouth. Senators really need to keep their noses the hell out of entertainment. But you know anything for votes. Religious a-holes are probably the worst of them all.
20054,"Also my last addition is that video games are not the main causation for violence. Correlation does not equal causation. If that were true, we'd have school shootings on a daily basis.
It's usually mental issues and neglectful upbringing that causes this. If anything video games are a form of escapism."
20055,"Good lord, I am not a Christian, but if there is a God, could he please nuke the US?"
20056,"""Pokmon is a game that teaches kids witchcraft.""
What Pokmon games are you playing? It's all about slavery, corporations and animal abuse. No spells or rituals in sight."
20057,"no-one in this video does not sound like a massive moron, fucking hell american media is so retarted AUSTRALIA TOO ADFGHJK:"" i wanna get famous so these people can hear me calling them what they are fear-mongering short sighted scapegoat abusers especially the 6 days in fallujah and the mass murder bits.........god they're stupid"
20058,It isn't the games fault it is the people that play it. They can't seen the vary vary big line between gun in any game to guns in real life. And the reason that soo many kids play cod and other violent games like that is because the parents just go out to GameStop or Walmart and but the violent games for their kids to play for fun.
20059,wtf did they blame before video games? they blamed music....wtf did they blame before music? they blamed film....wtf did they blame before film? books
20060,hmmm. What is entertaining about a game of murdering people? That Manhunt 2 game looks pretty intense and disturbing. How is this entertainment? So dark and negative and degrading...just sayin... I'm a mother and I was horrified. Don't think I could even support my grown up kids playing these games.
20061,"Is it really any surprise at all that the dumb motherfuckers over at Fox News are literally the only people creating sensationalist bullshit specifically to incite a controversy for better ratings and more viewers? No. It's not. I love how 80% of the time these fabricated ""controversies"" were covered by the news, it was those scumbags over at Fox News. If you still watch that bullshit and believe anything that comes out of a Fox News representative's mouth, you're a knuckle-dragging dumbass."
20062,"Most video games now a days are designed for a mature audience. If the player isn't mature, and takes the game way too seriously, it's not the game's fault; it's the player's fault, because they weren't able to draw the line between games and reality. It's especially not the game's fault if the mature content is purely optional, be it starting a massacre in an airport in CoD or in the streets of GTA. I will agree, however, that some content, like ""No Russians"" is uncalled for."
20063,"It pisses me off when something goes bad and they cant be arsed to actually analyse the facts so they just go "" erm yeah VIDEO GAMES!"" and then each parent shits brix and there is out rage"
20064,"The government rather ban games then spend money to cure the psychologic ill people who are shooting the place up,because it just cost nothing."
20065,everyone wants to avoid saying guns should just be banned and blame it on vidja games... MURCA!
20066,"My controversial ticked off moment was the ""Race War"" slander based around Resident Evil 5 due to the game taking place in Africa. You did not see a race war fume up at RE4 taking place in some location in Spain did you? answer in short would be No....some people are just too sensitive to things and for that I shake my head and say in as sincere (and non smart assed) of a tone as possible is that it is just a game. if you perceive it to be reality, then you need to do one simple thing. Do not buy the game or buy any games that comes from the company who makes them. That will do the most damage to their company (so to speak) but the problem is this though. Even if you yourself do it, that is not to say that the next person will do it and so forth and so on. So the end result is that I guess nothing can be done aside from your own protest of not purchasing the game."
20067,how is pokemon evil?!
20068,"My 10 year old little brother likes Hotline Miami.....WTF?!?!?! really i gotta be honest,extreme blood and gore really is entertaining in video games...i dunno what to do with my little brother, might as well recommend him to other violent games like Postal :D"
20069,Parents just give there kids games expecting that too keep them busy and they aren't taught what's right and what's wrong
20070,Lol I play games to sometimes let anger out I mean if your really angry just jump on gta 5 lol and I nearly pass out from giult if I accidentally hurt a stranger
20071,have we become this stupid as a whole? the first recorded war was fought over religion being violent is humane nature. Even the cave men killed each other. So what then?
20072,"Allright, this eats me up, you people are apperently mis-understanding the point of games...they are entertainment, not to simulate hell, heaven, or world war 3 or something...but really, they cause violence???World war 1 and 2, which game were they playing?Didn't think so...
Now, for that women who is flipping out saying'' I have this image of a bunch of teenagers laughing because they died, or didn't die, and restart, well my son didn't have that choice''....Lady, you have a loss, but ITS A GAME, ENTERTAINMENT, would you rather still be in the greek days where they forced people against there will to fight FOR entertainment?Of course not, if you do, you have a problem.Another thing, so, your saying that games cause violence?Of course you are, your reaching for ever little thing you can find in that pile of needles, just to get attention..for like 30 minutes of your entire life..Your focusing on the bad things.There are good things for every bad thing, world war?You sacraficed lives, to save millions upon millions of others, and we salute them every day!World War 2, The Allies prevented so much pain and misoury on so many innocents..Now, games are like movies, but playable..so..you ban games, you better as hell ban movies.Just wanted to put that part out there..
NO NO NO, it was show the sacrafices made, for the greater good against the bad.Now the no russian thing,what did that cause???Suicide hm?No?Shoot outs?No???WELL THERE ISNT A PROBLEM, YOU PARENTS ARE TO AFRAID TO ADMIT YOU WERE A BAD PARENT, AND DIDN'T CARE ABOUT YOUR SON/DAUGHTER...No...you blame the thing, you authorized them to play....Ok, i'm going a bit overboard with this but still, ok, 5:28 ticked me off the most, that woman was just rubbing salt in the wound, rubbing it in his face why he was such a failiure they kept saying it was focused on the misoury!oh no, BLAME THE GAMES EVERYBODY, SHE'S PLAYED MARIO, AND SHE'S JUST CAUSING SO MUCH HAVOC."
20073,"Now even fockin watchmojo has a political slant.
Bad job. Very bad job."
20074,Anyone else hear that sound that sounds like a kid on a mic saying hi at 1:10???
20075,"Pokemon is not satanic since they evolve, not encouraging animal violence because they have taken so much money and time to build poke centers, and I do get the racism."
20076,You can join the army and kill people but you can't play a fuckin video game????
20077,I love how most of the ignorant criticisms of these games are on Fox News
20078,"It sucks how people on the news are blaming games for all the bad stuff. I mean, I love watching the news, and I love gaming, but what these people are trying to do is really annoying. Killjoys. Killjoys everywhere."
20079,"Okay, I'm a Christian and a libertarian-conservative, but the first two are absolutely stupid. Those are the same preachers that said Harry Potter promoted witchcraft...
Stupidity knows no bounds."
20080,"Am i That only one who thinks these news reporters are just a$$holes that are mindless and just spread subliminal messages about random shit shows even the smallest sign of violence? I under stand what they think about the link to real life and video games but not every thing that has violence is bad. Also how do u know that mass killers even like video games and in order to do this its not like they are people who have video game consoles in there car who have rage quit from call of duty and take it out on people by killing them. so if u believe the shit that the news reporters say then tell them              ""Go To Hell U Bitch"""
20081,"Conservative logic: Don't ban guns! Ban games that ""encourage"" people to use guns! Did they happen to think that if you are a mentally sound person, that killing people in a game wouldn't actually make you kill people in real life?"
20082,Hey! Did you notice that literally all of the news coverage was on Fox? What do ya know! Those republicans at it again!
20083,So its okay to blame videogames because it more simple to just remove the legal weapon selling you know?
20084,"GAMING DOES NOT MAKE KILLERS
PEOPLE JUST KEEP BLAMING IT ON GAMES BECAUSE ALOT OF PEOPLE PLAY GAMES ITS JUST A COINCIDENCE ALSO SORRY ABOUT CAPS MY CAPS IS BROKEN"
20085,always the easy offensive americans in sweden we dont have that problems whit games. we play what we want and every one is okey whit that. how can they be angry about the mission in MW2 when you shoot people. you shoot pixels not real people omg
20086,"I believe, and before you insult me and say I'm an asshole, to say the least, it's MY opinion, that people tend to blame videogames because they don't wanna take the blame themselves. I'm not saying that parents are the ones to blame for a 16 year-old kid who kills 12 of his friends at school, but I am saying that if you live with your child everyday, you do have a certain ammount of influence on him and if he goes on to do that kind of things it is, in part and not in all extent, because you influenced him to do that or not to do the opposite thing.
I have played and/or watched every GTA since 2006, when I was 8 and I'm 17 now and I haven't even thought about buying a gun and killing half of my class. I think parents tend to blame external elements because they don't wanna regonize that maybe, just maybe, they're also the ones to blame up a certain extent."
20087,"America needs to stop blaming video games for real life tragedies. In my eyes, video games are entertainment and stress relievers, and absolutely never promote violet behavior. My friend,(who will not be named) is a straight A+ student, he does all his work, always does the right thing, and never lies (he tried once, he sucked at it) Anyway, you'd never think that he's the type of guy who plays Saints Row, GTA, and Painkiller when he gets home. All 3 of those franchises are extremely graphic and violet in-game, but this guy is an angel in the real world."
20088,These news people need to stfu video games do not start violence
20089,Oh shit the people who try to use video games for being evil are just 100% retards who don't even try the game like when in mass effect 3 you can skip the sex scenes by not doing it. i just played like a violent game when i was 3 and im still stable until now
20090,the problem is they have money in videogames that s why they dont bann anything
20091,"If I was a developer of a game and I got a load of backlash for my game being ""too graphic"". I'd just say ""oh fuck off"". People need to grow some fucking nuts and stop crying. 
Focus on real world problems you fucking ignoramuses."
20092,you can get left for dead 2 the american version in Australia you just gotta get the free patch that Australia gave permission to download
20093,Typical politicians love to blame games rather than blame what they have done. They have set up society to reward bad behavior and encouraged parents to leave their children in the care of others who don't care about how the children act. So when things go wrong they blame the games why because they can't blame the tv since they get money from them they can't blame other things since it would reflect badly on them so they blame the games because they can't blame anything else without putting themselves in a bad light.
20094,lol only fail parenting blames video games for violent behavior. how bout spend some time with your kids and teach them wats rit and wrong instead of letting the media to it...duh.......o nvm that would be too much work
20095,News teams need to stfu about how video games make problems in the world saying a kid shoots their school up because they played gta is like saying oh well umm we go to war because of video games also dose that make any fucking sense and the people that are talking about it are older than shit
20096,"Doom,Mortal kombat and manhunt 2 was my shit."
20097,I like the lady at the end. Everyone try to blame stuff on one single source but they ignore all other factors.
20098,F**K FOX NEWS
20099,I remember the first time I saw that Call of Duty level. Couldn't play it after that.
20100,"I play doom, counter strike and various other violent games since I was a kid and I still take spiders from the house out to the garden alive."
20101,"That ""no Russian"" mission was pretty fucked up though. I would be very disturbed if I played that. But the news still over reacted a bit, it is M rated after all."
20102,Just because a killer loved FPS doesnt mean that the games are responsible. The killers could have played those games to get the pleasure before they snaped.
20103,None who gives a fuck i play shooters and ive never thought of shooting someone but i would like to shoot a gun but wat boy would not
20104,"Call that postal 2 game controversial? huh? Ever played the original postal from 1997, remember that last level where you could almost walk into a elementary school and massacre everyone. call that controversial."
20105,"I play a lot of violent video games, listen to heavy music, and I have never wanted to massacre a bunch of people... It isn't video games. Its just some crazy bastard with a mental illness that wakes up one day and decides that he wants to shoot someone..."
20106,F*ck america.
20107,Great vid! Also did anyone else notice the guy she was interviewing at 5:27 started speaking gibberish when she ask her question. Wierd lol
20108,Guns don't kill people ! People kills people.  Look at this crack heads they need to stop blaming on video games fucking gooffeys
20109,Fox news pls.
20110,"USA:
We sell weapons for everyone, even under 18 years.
Better blame games for school shootings or killing"
20111,Australian gun laws FTW!
20112,"for everyone who doesn't live in America and blames us selling firearms for mass shootings, id like to point out something from experience. Horrible and deranged people who commit these crimes could almost just as easily get a weapon off the streets as they could from a store. If firearms were illegal to be sold, it doesn't mean the ""bad guys"" would not have them, but rather that the people with good intentions wouldn't. If someone plans to kill people, do you think they wont get their hands on a gun somehow? I know where to buy an illegal 38. revolver or an illegal AR for half the price you can get it in stores, and bad people can get them just as easily. I would never buy an illegal firearm, but believe me if guns were illegal for sale in stores, ""bad guys"" would be the only one's with guns."
20113,They all piss me off to be honest.
20114,Congressmen are given drugs to be afraid of everything. Thats why they be talking shit.
20115,Republicans are bad. Got the message Watch Mojo.
20116,"all of these people censoring and banning these games have nothing better to do with their lives and are very sad sad people because you know, fox news"
20117,"America is not a country where the civillians should be allowed to carry guns ,plain and simple.
Don't let every second civillian to carry a gun and you'll spare yourself those horrible cases ,don't just blame it on the video games ,blame your fucking retarde goverment...Don't wait for the next school massacre to bring up this subject again."
20118,Where's Wolfenstein?
20119,"You could be a terrorist in counter strike and plant bombs, and j don't see anyone having a titty attack on the counter strike series."
20120,"The media always blames mass shootings and everything else bad that happens in life on games, tv, guns, and everything else except the shooter. None of these things turns someone into a killer or a bad person. I play violent video games, watch violent TV, and I own several guns, and yet I'm pretty much a pacifist. I can't even remember the last time I raised my voice at someone."
20121,"I had it with these idiots who try to scapegoat video games.
If it wasn't for games, i would have most likely killed someone for real and been in jail a loooong time ago, WHY? because i would probably become crazy without them, we live in a world where you can't even do half of the things you're allowed and capable of doing in video games, a world without games is a boring ass world.
We all have issues in life, we all need to vent out a little anger and frustration, what better way than to do it in a virtual world where you're not hurting anyone in real life!
Between classical work problems and girlfriend problems and family problems, we all gotta find a way to chill, and contrary to idiotic mainstream belief; video games can actually be quite therapeutic for ones mind. whether you wanna vent yourself, relax, escape reality for a little while, none of it will have a negative effect on your mind, though too much may have a negative effect on your social life lol
And we gotta stand up and defend things we love to do in life. If some law came up that would make violent games illegal or some shit like that, i don't think i just speak to myself when i say that i would go out there and do some serious shit about this. I grew up with games, if you did too, then fight for your right to play whatever you want no matter how violent or ""offensive"" it may be.
And BY THE WAY.... games do notdesensitize people. FOR EXAMPLE:
I've cut off plenty of heads in video games, but once i saw a video on a website of a girl in mexico getting her head cut off slowly... and that shit stuck with me for a whole week, it was horrible to watch, and out of a fucking nightmare and not like anything i've seen in a game. I couldn't help but to wonder what vent on in her mind when it happened, how painful it was, how anyone could do such a thing to a human being. So don't fucking come up with idiotic theories that gamesdesensitize people, it may seem that way but most of us are always aware that the only thing we are cutting are a bunch of polygons in a virtual world."
20122,watchmojo is biased new age BULLSHIT fuck them! i hope they read this
20123,oh god Team Plasma is PETA!
20124,How about you tell congress I love those games
20125,Mortal Kombat blood code for Sega Genesis: ABACABB
20126,Why do they blame video games I play cod and gta and I'm not killing people I played killing games for 7 years and I'm not killing
20127,It's to late games are here to stay people are always looking for something to put the blame on
20128,"I don't think the news understand that: It. Is. Just. A. GAME! For fun! I'm not gonna think ""Oh time to go steal a tank from a military base and go on a massacre because GTA did it so it's ok!"" Idiots"
20129,1:05 and again...
20130,0:20 There goes Fox News being dumb again :/
20131,"I actually liked that war game idea, damn people kept the soilders from be immortalized thro a game"
20132,Nice & fox news.
20133,Wtf none of those shootings were caused by video games
20134,"The Call Of Duty massacre was absolutely disgusting and I really don't care what people will say and the excuses people will come up with in the replies. But let me tell you this, it might be a game, but that doesn't mean it can't affect someone."
20135,"Oh no I shot a bunch of pixels and more pixels flew from them, I must now commit mass murders and lose all morals, because fuck logic."
20136,Funny that most of the accusations come from catholic/christian extremist... could it be that the repetitive factor is the actual problem?
20137,"yes people don't kill people,guns don't kill people video gmaes kill people riiiiiiiight"
20138,"people blame games so they don't have to blame the true culprits, society. because we are society and we are responsible for what we do. not games. not guns. not drugs. just us.  and that dude who said the game is 'really realistic' might need to re-think that, because if he thought 'fuck me, is that real footage?' then he might need to hire a full time carer."
20139,GAMES SEND BAD MESSAGES TO OUR CHILDREN!!!!! games have a rateing system... look bitches... if you dont want your kid play video games with realistic violence... dont fucking buy it for them. moniter their time and what they look up on the internet.. check out what kind of friends they have and white kind of parents their friends have. maybe sit and talk with them about things they have alrady been exsposed too.. maybe dont even have kids and reduce the chance that your retarted offspring dont go on killing sprees in local school and fuck their little sisters. maybe just maybe. kill your self and the world would be a better place.
20140,If manhunt was banned/censored for its violence then imagine it now with next gen graphics
20141,"I like how Fox News is all about getting rid of big government, then that chick starts babbling on about getting into all kinds of personal info on people that play games, and basically targeting them as suspects."
20142,Top 10 skrillex song!
20143,"I find the press blaming video games for violence absolutely laughable. Its like they're trying to get people not to focus on mental issues and Six Days in Fallujah wanted to make the players realize the horrors of war, similar to a game like Spec Ops: The Line. But everyone had to freak out about it! And I feel bad for the woman who lost her son, I understand where she's coming from, I do. But I don't think the game was going to be a sugar coated glorifying war game like COD or Battlefield (not saying they are bad ) I think it was going to make gamers think about war and let it stink in that war isn't really something we should enjoy from the safety of our couch."
20144,Fake and straight..
20145,The reason the news hates video games in 3 2 1...... Video games and computers are killing Tv and news broadcasts
20146,"So making a game about a war portraying brave soldiers (and as far as i read, meant to honor the fallen ones) is bad... but making a movie about a navy seal's story of survival and the heroism of his teammates is ok.... alright then."
20147,"Number 1 still gets to me how the virtual worlds of gun play is what motivates young ones to kill. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT!!! People have been dying from what they see on TV, since the air of the first Superman flick, where kids and what not think they can fly like him so they leap off of buildings wearing a blanket. Its not the virtual world, but poor parenting. If you do not want your children playing this or watching that, then don't let them. Stop blaming the fictional entertainment world, since your bad parenting sorry asses allowed a fictional world raise your kids, not you"
20148,"I don't have a problem with these games, or running down hookers in GTA.. But that MW2 mission was fucked up... I was stunned when they opened fire on the peds, and kinda just walked through the mission.."
20149,The voice over guy sounds like joker from the mass effect series.
20150,gta doh
20151,The old Mortal Kombat games used to be really fun in there fatalities were boss but now they're kind of lame and it's no longer fun playing it anymore they use the same characters but in a way child proof there moves I've lost interest
20152,"Both liberals and conservatives want to control the media we take in and enjoy. I love how one side says liberals champion video games while the other bashes and vice versa. They both suck, and we usually side with our beliefs no matter if they try to fight something we enjoy. Hillary Clinton is still a staunch opponent against video games and Barbara Boxer has proposed a law that bans violent video games. Most libertarian politicians may not like violent or sexual games, but understand that they are popular because people want them. Eventually violence will be overdone and we'll be back to jumping on turtles and shooting aliens with lasers."
20153,People that came up with these controversies probably didn't even play the games they were accusing of murder and rape and whatever.
20154,"I find video game controversies stupid and a waste of everyone's time. I mean, they're freaking GAMES. They were made to be played and enjoyed. Humans are just so retarded, they find things to argue about, even when it is irrelevant."
20155,what game is at 3:25 ?
20156,"Anyone notice that most of the news came from Fox? Lol, those idiots just find one thing that goes against them and start lying and bullshitting a story about it xD"
20157,"i think that the press and the news should go every where but my only fucking enjoyable thing that i can do , if they want to create a game based on real events its not because they want to offend the families they want to tribute to them plus its a fucking GAME we aren't going to go on it and say ""wow i cant wait to kill U.S. army soldiers no we just want to have fun."" and look back at other games that are based on true event pretty much every call of duty. just my opinion"
20158,some kid goes crazy and does something bad  who do they blame video games!!!  not  the kid oh no . makes me mad. if people dont want there kids playing games like cod  or left 4 dead. THEN THEY SHOULD NOT BUY IT FOR THEIR KIDS. if i got a game my mom did not like SHE THROW IT OUT!!  just like that. people need to say no to their kid more often. not all games are mint for  kids..
20159,"okay im gonna get mad,
that realistic war game that got cancled needs to be put back on the work table
you anti war morons forget who it is on the front line rosking their lives to keep you safe in your little house and you low income paychecks,
our soldiers are dying and murdering the bad guys so you can just hate them?
no you show those brave men and women the love the need from what they saw and did.
they have seen death and blood and don't need to come home being called the bad guys
""my son didn't have the chance to start over, and those kids wil laugh and just say lets do that again..."" true your son died and is never coming back, its hard and you should feel sad, but be proud that he died to keep the country he loved safe from the towel heads in the middle east. and the news doesn't need to be commenting on games. they have the right to say what they feel but they should try to spread hate on a game that is trying to show you what happened.
that's why cod will never be a realistic war game, because you ant war morons don't want to see what happened, your scared of it and don't want to know its there,
I bet if we took all the anti war morons and put them on the front lines they would be dead in 2 maybe 4 hours tops from hiding in their hole.
I thank every soldier I see, I say thank you because if it wasn't for them then the united state would have fallen years ago, now true we don't fight all wars for the right reason but after we finish a war WE REBUILD WHAT WE DESTROIED!!! and from the pockets of the USA,
no country will do that for us and I for one say when we end it we leave it like it is, why go into debt for a country that will hate us no matter how many times we help them and protect them. and for the sex scenes... who the hell cares? kid will always find out about sex it is only normal to want to see and know about it,
and that woman saying it is only the guys picking the woman count? really!?
the women in games are who they are, developed by the game corp. if they want them to be sex figures then go to them and complain, don't go onto the news and complain and only give one side of the story, and gta V the torture scene is from trevor who keep in mind is unstable, it makes sense why he is doing the torture, and the rampage at any time? name one fps or sandbox game that killing isn't the main view point,
halo, cod, bf ect...
so to make this very long comment shorter I will conclude with
don't complain about war if you are not a soldier
if a game has a sex scene just remember that it is normal and if you have to bitch about it, go to the GAME CREATORS!!!
and if a game is to gory or to violent, don't play it and shut the hell up...
now I know im gonna get hate mail so bring it on assholes"
20160,What pisses me off is that he talks about it's the biggest deal that MW2 in the mission were you can skip it with a rating and third most it's not realistic.
20161,basicly #1because they just are saying hey you can have the same thinghappen ina video game and this person has a game consle it mus be form playing games
20162,I'm kinda surprised Postal 2 wasn't on there...
20163,"One that annoyed me was when the boy shot his mother. The controversy was that he reloaded his gun, people blamed games saying that he learnt it by them. When to reload in CoD you press X or Square."
20164,"I totally agree with the lady at the end of the video, the government blames video games for public shootings way too much, you have to consider whether or not the person has mental problems or anything else before you blame it on the fact that he played Call of Duty a week ago..."
20165,you cant smooth talk custards revenge that game is not deemed offensive that is just flat out offensive
20166,Please almighty news tell me what meds mass murders are on
20167,Now I'm afraid I'll run over a boomerang flower then have the US Congress blame Mario Kart.
20168,People have to understand that these games are for ENTERTAINMENT. It's not real. Most people just buy into the news and think EVERYTHING is true. If you actually saw the game with your own eyes you'd realize it's not all that bad. The video game rating system actually makes sense. Go to a gamestop and they warn your parent about the blood and gore. (that is if you are under 17) Plus it's the parents that let these under aged children like me to play a game like this. jeez just calm down.
20169,New number 1: World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor.
20170,"Oh Pokemon, you innocent video game franchise that builds up thousands of millions of fans' childhoods, as well as mine. 
Yeah, hearing all of the Pokemon controversy overreactions are probably one of the reasons why I'm no longer a Christian."
20171,I wonder if Rapelay didn't meet the requirements
20172,"america is a funny place, place of the extreme, run by extremist puritanist fighting the most rude games, .what puritain should one day understand is by forbiding and calling sacrilege games or movies, all they do is advertising especially to youth.i mean, any of those dude can remember the time they were young and someone said smoking is forbidden , or watching porn, drinking alcool, driving fast etc, of course some stuff should be forbidden for the protection of the person and others but forbidding movie , books, games etc is the best way to promote them for everyone and particularly to youth, collectors, and it s hyppocrite as everyone say violence is ugly but everyone stop to see blood when there s an accident on the motorway"
20173,"You know what, I'm GLAD you didn't list Postal2. That's about one of the funnest games I have ever played. You do a Jesus mode in that, WITH all the Fudge Pack shit, and you cannot say It's an awful bad game. Awfully challenging, no shit. The most challenging game I have ever played is Postal2 with Fudge Pack on 'Very Fucking Hard' doing a Jesus run. Even killing everyone along the way on VFH is brutal. Let alone not being allowed to attack anyone ever in order to do a Jesus run. AIDs darts and nukes all over the damn place."
20174,"People kill people, guns don't kill people, controllers don't kill people, People kills people."

20176,"Okay I will admit that I need help. This is my confession....I have been addicted to God of War for a few months now.......I recently attacked a guy with a wii controller, swinging it around like the blades of Chaos. I blame God of War for this is their game is so realistic it is somehow tied with reality."
20177,"I find it ironic that news organizations point towards video games after glorifying shootings with so much coverage of the perpetrator. I gotta say though.. that airport scene.. I was playing the game at a video game cafe, knowing nothing about it. I kept scoffing at all the scene skip option, until I hit that lvl. I've never had a video game impact me in a negative way like that before (unless you count WoW sucking away years of my life)."
20178,being a gamer in australia must suck...half of the games are banned there lol
20179,Keep your controversies to yourselves and let me enjoy my games.
20180,No Russian was the best mission in the fucking game
20181,Every single GTA xD oh and The south park games
20182,why was doom thought to be satanic. arent you killing demons in the game
20183,I hate when people say that school shootings are influenced by video games. In America they should ban guns and then school shootings wouldn't happen
20184,"I hate Mass Effect for the sex and for the over personal story. Halo is like a less personal (thats a good thing) lore freindly history book, focusing on key moments. And once you see something epic in halo, you cant go woah, as in its always bad for the humans. MW2 should not have had the massacre because its psychotic. and Pokemon does not promote any animal abuse, retards."
20185,Wait was that a real thing at 00:38... Lmao seriously?!?!
20186,"5:27 Wow, That was a dick move lady, Sure they did but the way she said it was really dicky, even the guy that lost the funding was in disgust."

20190,It not video games that makes people go out and kill people I've been playing games from about 11 I'm not 19 that's 8 years of gaming I haven't killed anyone so you can't blame it on video games
20191,"For one who the fuck cares about that women's song who was in a war then died, he knew that would happen even she knew and all there doing is making a game of what happened big deal not really"

20193,"lol @ Parents That Complain About Games. If You Do Not Like It, Do Not Buy It."
20194,"As an avid gamer and extensive researcher in the subject of video games and it's affects on younger children, I can conclude that up to the age of six (depending on a child mental development) it CAN be potentially harmful for children to play violent video games. However, I believe that FOX news is nothing but hypocrisy. it's perfectly acceptable to make any other game in the world, perhaps even a game involving the slaughter ofmuslims. However, poke fun at US or even attempt to make a game where a US soldier is even slightly harmed, well that's a different story and completely immoral. Fuck Fox news, they offer nothing but hypocrisy and anytime you prove them wrong, theirtypical response is ""well I don't see how that's relevant"" or ""well-well-well-I BELIEVE-I BELIEVE-Listen to me, stop talkin' for a moment"""
20195,Fuck Australia. Fuck Russia. Fuck the Republicans. Fuck the Democrats. Give them all ebola.
20196,6:22 There's already a game where you can be a terrorist: Counter-Strike.
20197,@WatchMojo.com You should've included the Bully incident when that Florida lawyer who shall remain nameless came out on day 1 & proclaimed Rockstar's Bully (Great fun game by the way) to be a so-called Colombine simulator the very second the game was first unveiled only for a judge to throw the book at the overzealous moron's a@$ once it was demonstrated & proven that Bully was nowhere near as violent as the idiot lawyer claimed resulting in the Florida lawyer's much deserved disbarment.

20200,Issue over real guns versus fake guns. Today's logic - Lets ban the fake guns.
20201,"1:01 ""Se""xbox. XD"
20202,The problem is people would rather blame virtual guns then real ones because if they blame the real guns their blaming the second amendment rights and god forbid they do that it's easier for them they don't wanna face facts because that's a hit to what they believe in
20203,I can understand Six Days in Fallujah. I was kinda looking forward to it when i heard word of it though.

20207,Look at how many films are made about wars. I suppose we should stop making those too? Oh what because 50+ years have passed it's automatically okay? Double standards.
20208,"I have played and essentially owned every GTA,Saints Row,and Mortal Kombat game since I was 3 and I have never been in any legal troubles or shown any signs of violence"
20209,"I hate news people, all they do is blame people and lie about everything. Also, video games don't teach people how to actually shoot a gun cause you cant just hold down the right trigger on a gun and it doesn't show you how to turn the safety off and how to cock the gun. People who think video games make people violent can suck a bag of d**ks"
20210,"Heres a fact Most news people that complains about video game, own by BIG PHARMA, and the shooter are under the drug that are produce by big pharma."
20211,"I think the only controversial game was the gta sex mod and the battle of fallujah

20216,"The media can say lots of crap about video games. When was the last time they criticized some pop song, gory movie, or celebrities? The blame always goes to these games. What these people don't realize is that millions upon millions of people play these games with no negative results. I mean, video games are entertainment as well. If the media is going to poke blame at it, they might as well blame music, movies, and the politicians that start actual violence."
20217,"Fucking Fox man, fuck Fox"
20218,always Illuminati
20219,before video games idiots were blaming comic books
20220,"Fox news let me be the first to congratulate you but do you hear that sound that's the sound of no one giving a single fuck about your pathetic excuse for a "" fair and balanced "" way of force feeding your spineless lies or as you like to call them ""beliefs"" to people who are too busy laughing at your stupidity and your ignorance because if there's one thing you lack besides a few dozen IQ points is understanding that not everyone in the world shares your "" beliefs """
20221,"Always Fox News, lol!"
20222,"PETA is dumb as hell. They see Pokemon as animal abuse, so they make a violent version of it? Thats just as stupid as hell."
20223,If the game Hatred comes out.... We should see another one of these stories.
20224,Six days of Fallujah sounds great please make it
20225,"End of the day its entertainment and you cant blame the games for any of it and if you do your just an idiot,
I come from England and we have good gun control so its rare to hear of a shoot out but even in america where you can get a hold of guns much easier it still comes down to the individual
I have played games mainly shooting based since owning a console and i am now 28, I love guns and respect all weapons, I enjoy going to airsoft and own about 6 airsoft guns but I know not to shoot anyone ... so i dont its as simple as that!! so to blame shooting games and not on peoples actions is lazy and stupid!!!!!
i am pretty sure there was no COD or Battlefield but we had the word war 1-2 and the mass amounts of violence and murders before hand..... GTA 5 torture scene is no worse than what the government are happy to do for example guy fawkes had worse done to him then that. If anything it just makes things less shocking to see for us.... even then i have seen dead people on the bloody news and i will rather see a virtual dead person than a real one but that gets chucked in your face.
so simply put people that blame games for what happens just need to look back in history and say ""oh its just copying what religious groups and governments are happy to do but we can push the blame on others"""
20226,"The last one is so cool!! "" Mad world "" and dam guys shut the hell up it's just a game people play...come on! When you play a cooking game that doesn't make you a cook and when you play a army game that doesn't make you part of a army so don't say it makes you a killer when someone plays "" GTA5 "" and many others"

20230,How many f*cking rap songs and heavy metal music have done this but they dont get any shi*t (all other songs too but these ones really stand out)
20231,"ahhhhhhhhhhh why cant people shut up about the shootings and blaming it on games ive been playing call of duty,pokemon,and manhunt sence i was five and i do good in school and ive not been killing people for 6 years also if you dont want your children playing it then look at the games they have once so often"
20232,real life is far worse than any video game out there. seeing as EVERY game ever has been influenced by something in real life. wars and porn were a thing before video games and no one said anything then.
20233,"This is funny considering Violence isn't something new to the world, something only vented when with the creation of video games and movies, I suppose then the gladiator combats of the Romans and all the wars and senseless violence of history of the world is all caused by a time traveler going back through time and introducing video games to the people. As long as there are people in the world there will always be violence as long as man exists there will always be misery, to blame something that only existed for a fraction of that time and claim it's responsible for the the violent nature of humans is beyond stupid and denial that humans are by nature violent creatures, saying that humans need to be taught violence."
20234,I cant believe people are blaming video games for the shootings and stuff going around

20239,"You know that they blamed comics for negative influence on children? Now they look back on it and laugh, because it was a stupid assumption to make. Now games are becoming increasingly violent, they're blaming them? Did they not think for a second that this is another absurd assumption to make? Even with all of the evidence supporting that they're wrong, and no evidence supporting they're right? People are believing their shit because they're hearing it from a news reporter? lol, k"

20244,Noteice how most of the news clips were from foxs........ Seriously though fuck those guys

20252,"One of the things this video got wrong (ignoring the 'controversy' part of it entirely) is that it is LIBERAL media that always points the finger at video games. Conservative media, what little there is, points the finger at, among other things, the education system, lack of morality in society, and lack of proper ways of stopping gunmen when they do get going."
20253,"the only one i agree with is #3.and MAYBE #2.
however,videogames(some of the only,of course) are not the only stuff that mess up some people.what about movies?and music videos?did everyone forget about that?however,NONE should be blamed.yeah they mess up some people,but it's the people's fault.the majority of the people would just realise it's a videogame.
they are just videogames."
20254,"Mental Illness is the true reason that makes the real guns appear in the hands of wannabe killers and video games are what makes me feel like if i am in the room when a terrorist is acting out, I may have a shot of taking them out or at least lending my peers an extra second to finish the job for the sake of the rest. Batman has his mask and a utility belt and the cops are all in blue, but how can the bad guys see me when i look like me or you."
20255,"Video games are meant to be fun. Video game company's make games from past event's/ things that people have done. They don't make games that people could do in the future.

I woman called game stop asking the store to stop selling teen games to her 16 year old son...I'm but he is an adult he can play what he damn well please.

20260,"In video games, I kill hundreds of people a day and don't even think about it, but I know for a fact that I could never bring myself to actually kill a real person. Killing pixels on a screen is MUCH different from killing a living breathing human being who is loved and cared for by other living breathing human beings."
20261,"lmao females in Mass Effect being used only for their sexuality? 1:03 Bitch don't comment on a game series you haven't played. For one, Shepard can be an ass kicking female. For two, most of Shepard's female companions play an important or valuable part in the trilogy and not just some crew member to bang. Without his/her friendship & connections with Tali, Shepard wouldn't be able to get the Quarian fleet to work with him/her smoothly if at all. Without Liara, much of the first game wouldn't be playable because she's the key to figuring out a lot of the important pieces (so is Tali with her proof on Saren), Shepard wouldn't have discovered the Crucible, and he/she wouldn't have Shadow broker resources to use. EDI in the 2nd and 3rd game runs the Normandy SR-2 but also SAVES the ship with Joker's help from the Collectors. Jack has a troubled past you help her resolve and eventually in 3 takes a group of biotic kids under her wing, Kasumi's a thief that has more interest in stealing things & adventure then sleeping around, and Samara is a powerful religious biotic that needed help with family issues...don't know what I can add for Ashley O.o Feminists either need to make sure their ACCURATE in their accusations or shut the fuck up."

20265,Pokemon.....satanic. I can understand the falujia (most likely butchered that word) game and the no Russian level getting flak....BUT FUCKING POKEMON! Come on people how is Pokemon possibly satanic. It's a Japanese game that's translated over to English
20266,which game is the one on 3:39?
20267,i find it funny they brought up the killing of the Russians in an airport in call of duty but they didn't say anything about the fact that there are maps where the bad guys are all African and the online gameplay was seals vs africans. lol

Another issue. People seem to state and needs to be said,shouted out. Those who do it are often not stable & shouldn't be let out in public for some time or never.A normal brain doesn't do this. A messed up one does.Psychopathics and such. I would darn say to parents. I think it can be your child that needs a mental evaluation."

20278,"When it comes to mass shootings, its not the gun, its not the fucking games, its the crazy nut job pulling the trigger"
20279,Was that Yogscast Kim?
20280,Is it me or dose the USA over react at stuff
20281,"Extreme liberals, like the author of this video, are downright silly. If a video game had a science in it showing children having sex, they would say something like, ""But it was only oral sex, so the complainers were just being obstinate!"" You simply have to pity these people."
20282,But Battlefield Vietnam was okay or what...
20283,Maybe Americans shouldn't have guns and maybe people wouldn't be murdered
20284,"There are too many people in the world that care too much about violent video games. If you have common sense, then it shouldn't be a problem. What if someone created a game on 9/11. I mean, its a game. People did lose a lot of loved ones, but why should they care about the game? Now, if the game was about preventing 9/11 and turning the ending into something happier, then probably the game would be accepted. Because then the game would be about saving those lives, not killing them. Hmmm........... just my opinion on this. I just feel like people think the world is filled with stupid people who can't tell the difference between what's real and what's digital."
20285,Leisure Suit Larry deserved an Honorable Mention.
20286,ANITA SARKEESIAN?!
20287,Still news just fuck off
20288,Shut up fox and other news video games do not cause people to muder
20289,I love how the bible thumping rejects at Fox News are always in the thick of asinine blame gaming.
20290,As in- insensitive pricks that can't live in the real world try to ban games
20291,"this is indicative of total desensitisation, sure, dont let scruples get in the way of a good game, you know, just throw your moralistic values out the window. there SHOULD be warnings, warnings that state, THIS IS FICTION! should you at any time feel as if what is happening in the game is possible in the real world, stop playing, and consult your local mother..."
20292,"Currently doing research for a speech on violence n games -
Barely any connection between the 2 
Thanks 4 the upload watchmojo!"
20293,I'm surprised JFK reloaded wants not even in honorable mentions
20294,How come Postal isn't even on this list? ( I know it's in the beginning)
20295,This video is a it biased all right but watchmojio is right in saying that people blame video games when people with real guns get involved
20296,"I strongly agree with the last one, games are mostly to blame for stuff like that!!"
20297,"I wonder what video game these people would call ""good"". Probably something where you drive the kids to school under the speed limit, before you go to work in the office and then go bowling with co-workers and make fun of Jimmy's hairstyle..."
20298,Its funny how every shit head saying shit about these games are all Fox news bastards.
20299,"this is ridicolous, ahahhaahah.... so....if i play farmville on facebook do i become a farmer?"
20300,Why the fuck does cod (Call of duty) get the blame i mean What the fuck?!?!?!?!?! Have you seen battlefield I mean really lay off call of duty
20301,"If you think a video game is too violent, offensive, or over sexualized, then don't play it. If you don't want your kids to play it, don't let them. Let everyone practice their freedom to choose."
20302,"So someone can watch action movies where numerous people are killed/shot on screen but movies aren't so bad a game that does the same thing suddenly is blamed and the reason why someone goes out and commits a crime? how does that work? I remember when horror movies used to get blamed when they were the big media in the 80's, 90's now video games are mainstream so they are the new target. It's such a stupid argument and if someone commits a crime and they happen to love games that is surely just a coincidence because millions of people will play the same game and never do something in real life because we know it's only a game!"
20303,"That woman reporting on Mass Effect is a fool, its a role playing game where you choose what you want to do. you can be straight or homosexual, any sexuality. I suppose now that those twats will probably say oh I don't know anything about sports games (lets say: FIFA, NHL or hockey or whatever, (I'm English so I don't know much about it) or Madden NFL) But WATER IS BAD. Or foul play can make someone violent..."
20304,"The first videogame I can ever recall playing was Jane's 1999 combat flight simulator. Sure I also played some kid games (which I forget what they were called) but man, I remember playing for hours shooting Nazi AND AMERICAN planes down.. I was 4. Those were the days. I'd be flying an Me-262 and blowing up C-47s and B-17s... I'm still normal."
20305,Pokemon is a game which it teaches kids the world of witchcraft Just shut up shut up SHUUUUUUT UP
20306,Top 10 Fox video game controversies
20307,Fuck the God damn government and God damn congress! Video games are always to blame when it comes to adults talking! Makes me sick!
20308,God why do women have to be so god damn bitchy. This is why some people are gay.
20309,im sick of people blaming violent video games for violent peoples actions. its bad parenting tha makes bad people
20310,Wow but gamers are the nicest people
20311,"I think there are two points in which game players and concerned folks can both agree:
- Game companies and retailers should be completely up-front about content when promoting or selling a game to a kid or his/her parents; likewise, parents need to do their parental duty to watch and discuss games with mature content with their kids. (Or anything else about life.)
- If you're not entirely comfortable with a game or its content, feel free to vote with your wallet and/or express your thoughts to the publishers directly; any company worth their code will be counting and listening."
20312,"DO YOU HATE ""HATRED""?"
20313,"Blaming video games for people's violent actions is such bullshit. If they can argue that they're offensive and that they spur dangerous activity, then we should be able to argue that they're showing us how lucky we are to have the lives that we have."
20314,"Hitler didn't play video games....Ancient Romans didn't play video games...Humanity is full of violent people who decide to kill, video games or not they will attempt to kill for whatever reason they have, and also, yes little kids may pick up the gun they saw in their big brothers COD (Don't Leave Guns Where They Can Find Them!) or think that people respawn ,but those things happen because children aren't taught correctly or are exposed to violent games like Mortal Combat too early, yes some kids are mentally more mature than others in what they can understand about death and killing I will add that, but it is not the games fault its peoples fault."
20315,And bring back MW2 for xbox one and ps4.
20316,San Andreas remake? plz
20317,"I don't believe we should characterize people who think videogames cause violence and those who don't as conservative and liberal. I think we just characterize them as close minded idiots(the game haters) 
And the non-idiots. Or something more witty that I'm sure someone else on the internet can come up with."
20318,Where is Postal 2 ?
20319,notice how its only fox who gives a shit time after time lol
20320,"Lol. Ok, so games cause people to go on crazy gun massacres? Well, what about all the movies?"
20321,I love how press especially fox news love to say video games or music or movies cause killings really so if i play farm land I'm a fuckin farmer plus what does the congress and press have to do about video games there's more important shit to actually worry about over bashing against entertainment and its lovely how they overlook mental illnisses and scientific research congress and fox are a bunch of dipshits
20322,If they have portal on there hate list then we might as well put tf2 on here for support Conga lines.
20323,"This is why I hate news like those, they have alot of nerve. When they lie 24/7, games are not to blame, they're just whiny babies."
20324,I'm still so furious at what the woman says about ME right at the start. Mass Effect is legitimately one of the least problematic game series' going.
20325,Fps Games like Call of Duty DO NOT AND I MEAN DO NOT CAUSE MURDERS ONLY THE PERSONS MIND!
20326,Playing many videogames for alot of time turn the  players on nerds and lazy not killers deal with it 8)
20327,The world of Pokemon IS pretty fucked up if you think about it.
20328,It's not just conservative media that blames video games for shootings. Columbine and lots of those other ones in the 90s happened before Fox News even existed.
20329,"Two facts:
Shooter games are becoming more realistic and selling more and more copies every year
Violent crimes with firearms have been steadily decreasing for the last couple decades."
20330,Number 4 just got me. I fucking hate the way they treated it.
20331,"Violence in movies = acceptable, violence in games = unacceptable...? Silly Americans"
20332,"People blame video games for the reason why people are violent. I think it should be blamed on the parents. They should play the game or ask someone what is in the game before they give it to their kids. They should remind kids that it's just a game. If someone has a mental disability, then don't give them the violent games."
20333,Violence is always better then that bullshit
20334,"I hear 5 year olds on Xbox Live all the time. And the theres parents complaining ""Oh, my 5 year old is acting like hes shooting things!"" I think those parents are fucking stupid. Ive heard video game producers saying that the responsibility of limiting game violence relies in the parent. its true."
20335,Why the creepy voice at 5:28 ?
20336,Nnnnn NO. that last one is just people finding things to blame on video games
20337,6:20 what are you going to take away counterstrike too?
20338,The mass effect one is so stupid. With that logic we should all try to ban porn.... cough cough never happening
20339,"People are just so damn stupid, if you can't handle a torture scene then why the fuck are you even playing a game that's about killing."
20340,"How come no one points at the main problem: parenting and censorship. 
No one points fingers at the parents or the fact that the US censors way too much. Maybe if parents took a few minutes to talk to their kids we wouldn't have all this bullshit."
20341,"And remember, no Russian"
20342,Fox always ruins it....
20343,"Pokemon as a satanic message? Please. MatPat made a series debunking the Pokemon controversies over three videos. And Mortal Kombat/Street Fighter being way too violent? There IS a reason that they have an M rating. That, and younger kids don't exactly play Street Fighter/Mortal Kombat.
However, GTA and CoD have NO EXCUSE. Kids actually have gone on crime sprees attempting to re-enact what goes on in those two games. GTA has been involved with more lawsuits than any other franchise that I know of, and I've met some REALLY messed up kids that play CoD and GTA. Aside from the professional CoD base (yes, there IS one that is sponsored by Apex), the kid fanbase behind CoD is pretty pathetic.
And CoD isn't even true to actual military happenings! It teaches kids to be horrible people and to be ethnocentric. Military doctrines? What the flying f**k are those!? Half the stuff in CoD missions throws international military law out the window."
20344,im just saying is there not an age border for like every game. and is it not the parents responsibility to make shore that their kids dont play that game then. It's like keep it for yourself dont take it out on everyone else
20345,"Well, I guess i should watch out because i am an animal abusing,racist witch who will be hunted down along with my friends and hanged like in 1690s Salem. I can't believe they found out the true, secret messages behind Pokemon!"
20346,"Killing Fictionally: Woohoo!! Just got some points! * KA BOOM!* Ah man, I died, dont worry, ill respawn next round!!
KIlling in real life .. : 1 death equals an estimate of 20 to 50 people in grief.
So multiply that by how many people you have killed in a video game, and noticed how no one cares :)"
20347,Guess Mario Kart makes me want to steal a go-kart and throw turtle shells or banana peels at random drivers
20348,Mk & san andreas take the cake as far as a street buzz
20349,"i fucking hate that priest, the thing demonic is him his fucking false prophet and i hope i goes to hell >:3 im not saying that im addicted or i love pokemkn its just not right."
20350,"Mortal Kombat didnt help start ESRB, it was the game that single handly started it..."
20351,The only gun I would be holding IRL would be an airsoft one :P
20352,"I don't understand why people try and ban video games for stuff like this. I love when game makers have the balls to mortify their audience and critics. I absolutely loved, and was completely shocked when I was told to gun down innocents in an airport as a mission. This is where this stuff belongs, in video games, not in real life."
20353,"The people commenting bellow about the hazards of gaming are the kind who don't feel the need to research pesky things such as facts or studies and take everything as ""well it was on the news so it must be true"" Some school shooters play video games. That's clearly what causes them to shoot up a school! Actually no, that's not how research works. Not at all."
20354,"Them Sons a bitches. ARE YOU KIDDING ME CONGRESS?! OBAMA!? YA SON OF A BITCH! But no really. It is the players choice in all of these games. What they do, and what they do afterwards is there choice. The game is not manipulating us. Playing Madden 15 doesn't make me a NFL Football player does it? Damn."
20355,How does Pokemon encouage whichcraft o.O dog fighting maybe but still like all these shown... ITS A GAME! and mostly NOT REAL
20356,fucking fox news hated when i was younger still hate em and always will. what a joke. i bet that lady didn't even know where the actual battle of fallelujah was
20357,"I'm surprised that Dante's Inferno wasn't anywhere on the list. Because let's face it, scything through hordes of ""Unbaptized Demon Babies"" is pretty freaking controversial."
20358,"Oh no! I play flight simulator and mario, im OVIOUSLY a school shooter"
20359,Ive said it in another vid. All the goverment officials sit there cryi. And blamin video games for the cause of all these mass shooting. But i used that dick chaney insodent with the shoot gun there as an example. U take one of these assholes crying tie his ass to a chair and grab a cod disk and a 12 gauge shotgun.  Throw the disk at his left leg and ask him wat effect that had. Then grab the 12 guage and blows his other leg clean the fuck off. Then ask him what hurt more a fake cg game or a 12 gauge tot he leg. I bet chaneys boy eho took one to the head would make the right choice
20360,"This is bullshit so that parents won't pay games for their kids, damn politics."
20361,Haters have got to hate on us gamers
20362,"What about horror movies? I don't understand, if violence in video is an issue, why not expand it to movies. In all honesty, it's just bull shit.
Trying to use video games to blame why an honor student go on rampaging when evidence suggests he had not played any video games. Where is the blame headed to in that case? People jump the gun and prefer not to root cause any issue. BTW, every single issue has a specific cause. Using generality or assumption to fix something is like when the car overheats, you blame it on the engine beeing bad. Whereas, the cause was due to leaky radiator.
When will out politicians and culture learn to do root cause analysis. Statistics analysis is used only to as a guiding principle, and not a tool for enforcement of an assumption."
20363,"I love that close to all, if not all, of the media ""freak-outs"" is from FOX NEWS..."
20364,"Anybody remember the ""blood code"" for Mortal Kombat on Sega Genesis?"
20365,"What honestly pisses me off about all of this is just Faux news, especially on the night of Faluja. Agreed, it twas a questionable game to make, but just how Faux news handles it and usually all their stories, they act arrogantly above everyone."
20366,I got African Ebola Autism from this video.
20367,"So let me get this strait: Conservatives want to ban violent video games or at least track the buyers because they may cause school shootings, but don't want universal background checks for actual gun buyers. Because the 2nd amendment is far more important than the 1st amendment. Yeah, sure, that makes sense...."
20368,"Wow, I understand it's a video on controversies, but next time make your personal political bias less obvious."
20369,Watching this video reminds me of how many idiots and bad parents there are in the world. Trying to blame anything else but themselves.
20370,"some people are ignorant as hell....why blame video games....? why not blame the news, its about as real as it can get, every day theres a story about someone getting shot and killed or raped or watever but no..they blame it on a virtual game -.- what alot of common sense."
20371,They should just ban the mentally unstable from purchasing violent video games. Or to buy a violent video game you have to be screened for mental issues or people can just get the fuck over themselves and realize people are just fucked up from the beginning.
20372,The addoption thing with portal was taken out of context
20373,People actually reported the Portal 2 making fun of adoption?
20374,5:56 Who puts that in video game? This is crazy!
20375,
20376,"This cant just be done for games, it has to be done for books and movies if its happening togames as well."
20377,"Peta is so fucking stupid. But so is the Australian government. Must suck playing video games there.
But Fox News, that's a different level of stupid."
20378,Fucking Do Gooders! Pokemon's fucking satanic? Pokemon?
20379,"i always pick games with a lot of violance n horror,, n i dont think about going around killing people,, sick people will kill no matter what.... blaming a video game is retarded,,, n if u find it offensive,, just dont fucking watch or play it... fucking retards... good list btw:)"
20380,"I hate when people think video games cause violence,Jack the Ripper,H,H,Holmes,The black dahlia killer, none of them had Video games."
20381,I love when they blame the games for these stupid shooting i play all these games and am not stupid to do something like that the reason theres shooting because people are getting tired of other people bullying and steeling people money cops doing stuipd shit for no reason people need to start being nice to other people and stop being dicks then maybe this shit would stop same with the gov fucking us over all the time and sure there other reasons too but its not because of the games yes maybe some kids shouldnt play them b/c they might not be smart enough to know the differents thats when there parents should know there kids enough to know if they should let them play that game or not
20382,"Hell. No russians was my  favorite mission XD. HACKERS, FUCK OFF INTO YOUR SPACESHIP AND GO BACK TO LEGOLAND YOU PIECES OF SHIT. LEAVE MW2 ALONE. FAVORITE GAME AND ITS FUCKED NOW."
20383,What really pissed me off was when people were saying that slender was over the top because some two kids tried to kill another kid. Really? Fucking Slender?
20384,"I'd make a game who's sole point is to murder senators, and I'd even get the likeness of certain senators cough*Hillary*couch"
20385,"Think about this... You are not forced to massacre the civilians, you do not have to shoot so many innocent people, it is all choice."
20386,"Its pretty stupid that people blame video games for these tragedies. I play saints row, gta 5, and many violent gory games and I don't ever think about killing dozens of people. Its because those people already have something that's wrong with them and aren't all there. Then when they play those games they then have the urge to kill and reenact certain scenarios."
20387,"My view in this is that only few games probably have 'psychological effects' but that's really how long you play on it, I mean like 10 hours a day that's not good but then the government are mostly blaming all violent video games just because they don't know what else to blame all the violence on cough cough guns in the US"
20388,My son played call of duty and he's ok
20389,It's not the games I played shooter games since I was 6 and now I graduated from Stanford with hardware and software engineering degrees. Im okay even though I played killing games
20390,"I'll have you know, female journalist, my fem-shep only slept with women, thus endorsing her as a staunch feminist AND gay-rights activist. So THERE!"
20391,"i know i enjoy video games, but for christ sake, dont people ever actually stop to think that maybe they shouldnt be letting little children or mentally screwed people play this stuff? its called parental control. you cant even build a game based off ww2 or some other conflict in history because some activist things ""oh the game shows explicit content of murdering citizens and innocents,""
get wrecked, history teachers things and people need to stop calling it explicit. especially in game format."
20392,"I've been playing GTA for 10+ years and have never came close to killing anyone in the real world
I sure do like killing hookers to get my money back tho"
20393,bruh how can call of duty grand theft auto or ANY video game cause violence in real life... ppl just want a reason to ban something cool! most of the news is bullshit and sob stories anyway #FuckEm
20394,My friend is from Austrailia and u have to be 21 to play mk
20395,"Funny thing tho, most of the controversie talked about in the news is Fox, such bunch of fucking dumb people, well all news channels are dumb"
20396,why do people have problems with games but not movies
20397,I think I'm going to go shoot up a museum(   )
20398,"I'm surprised fox news hasn't covered tetris. ""This game encourages children to dismember everything so it would fit perfectly!"""
20399,I hate Fox News!!! Racist right winged bastards!!! Their always pushing an agenda.
20400,"Mass shootings are not caused because of video games. They are caused due to toxic masculinity in our culture. It's not strange that all mass shootings are carried out by men and boys, is it?"
20401,i hate that people blame videos games for mass shooting's that is called bad parenting when a persons parent leave their child in there own dark thought's with out finding out until someone dies. And it is also really bad childhoods and with no one to show them from right or wrong
20402,I think the game about the school shooting would've been on this list
20403,All must every story pissed me of I hate the media on video games
20404,Somebody tell the media to stop talking bad about video games
20405,"Yo this is why we have to not play sick stuff like Hatred.... just look up the trailer. Its ridiculous. Like its sole purposeis to destroy our games (modern warfare, etc) reputation."
20406,which GTA is this? 4:04
20407,"5:10
It's like boo fucking hoo"
20408,"and they say we have freedom we don't if we cant have some fun playing video games
fuck all those pussies who want to take my fun away!!!!"
20409,"I know 1000's of comments below me have already stated this, but it's absolute utter crap when someone's blames video games for mass-shootings/murders. Because while there are some stereo-typical gaming douche-bags who brag about whatever level prestige they have on CoD, the majority of the gaming community play games for the enjoyment. These people complain that games show us that it's completely fine to perform terrorist actions and murder innocent lives, but they have no idea what's the game about or how the game plays. Most of the time, you are a bad person and you suffer great consequences for murdering people and nuking buildings. And as gamers, we understand that this is an socially unacceptable thing to do. So next time you blame games for murders/shootings, get some evidence and show us REAL points other than 'it's violent and addictive.'"
20410,"that ""no russians"" mission is horrible thats scarring and evil the worry about it was just
i am going on holiday next week to america that scared the hell out of me even though i know that cant really happen because of security but come on why make a mission like that?"
20411,"It pisses me off that they go on that with a GAME, waste money in some stupidities like documentaries or even in programs against something not real. And if a mentally disordered kid played a game and then did something its not games fault, its the kid one for playing it, because i have played almost all games mentioned and im as happy as everyone else."
20412,"""It was revealed that the school shooter had eaten Frosted Flakes for breakfast the morning of his attack.""
bans Frosted Flakes"
20413,"Have you notice that FOXNews always shows up to criticize entertainment media (mostly video games) but they come from the same channel with Family Guy, American Dad and all those shitty and derogative reality shows. -_______-"
20414,"I destroyed countless planets with billions of inhabitants in ""Master Of Orion 2"" - why does the police not have kicked in my door already and maced me???"
20415,Fuck the news and jewish media
20416,"The ones that piss me off is all of them, because u can't blame real life on games that have guns in them. The game is ok but the people that play them can be psychopaths and that doesn't make the game bad it makes them bad. Also with this ISIS thing on the Internet people that see the propaganda aren't always going to join ISIS but some people will."
20417,The 6 days in fallujah game was given testaments as to what happened there by us marines. If anything the games main objective was not only to entertain but also to document the lives and experiences of soldiers over there.
20418,Cute how a large amount of the most targeting and negative news clips came from Fox News...
20419,"Nice going America, let's blame everything bad that happens on an entertaining video game and not on fucking gun laws, idiots."
20420,so you cant get Manhunt 2 longer??
20421,"Fun Fact: Before video games, DND (Dungeons and Dragons) was blamed for real life violence.
People Are stupid"
20422,"Video Games do not cause mass shootings. Games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 sold millions of copies, and how many of those players went on mass shooting rampages? My guess would be NONE.
Crime is a choice. People need a scapegoat, so music and video games are it. Nobody ever blames the 2nd amendment and America's obsession with guns as a contributing factor, everyone praises the military when they bomb hundreds of enemies in the Middle East, but virtual murder on a video game - now that is satanic."
20423,Then a rant war starts in the comments
20424,GTA cannot be held as a series controversy since each game in itself had a unique controversy.
20425,"If ppl actually think video games contribute to real life violence...you are full of it. I guess we should ban certain books for the same reason. I guess 50 Shades of Grey should be banned bc it will influence women and men that domestic violence is ok.
Use your friggin common sense ppl."
20426,"straw man fallacy, straw man fallacy everywhere"
20427,Its just a fucking game calm down let us just have fun who cares about it
20428,the majority of these games are only controversial because women complained. puts gamergate in a whole new light when you understand that.
20429,"Hold up, ""NightTrap""? that games damn near impossible unless you have a sheet of paper telling you what room to be in and how long you have to fuck around before going to those rooms, its so hard"
20430,"Had to agree with #9, even though I hardly play Pokemon anymore."
20431,"1:32 - 1:38
I lost it."
20432,"BREAKING NEWS!!
Many mass murderers admit to drinking water, is water really safe for your children? Tonight at 11 on Fox"
20433,"Doom is a game about killing demons
So religious organisations thought that was bad? XD"
20434,So based on this video how do you think people will react to hatred?
20435,"Why blame video games for showing sex scenes when real porn is just one click away or when tabloids with half naked, drug addict celebrities are adorning the shelves in supermarkets and the public streets. Seriously, one newspaper stand had porn magazines with full naked porn stars in full view, near my bus stop."
20436,the airport mission upset and disturbed me as a kid! was a good game though
20437,How the fuck can u blame a murder on a game? Wtf if ur kids are that fucking dumb that they will kill someone because it was fun in a game the n DON'T BUY THEM THE FUCKING GAME
20438,"Honestly fucking enough you wanted to blame video games for mass shootings and homicides, they tried to take the guns away, but no you wanted to keep your guns you need them for protection, but your kids can get to them easily. Nah that doesn't matter we should get rid of violent games.....yeah let's control our childrens' lives and get rid of violence......are people now a days really this ignorant?!"
20439,Mass shootings blamed on FPS games everytime that I see it on the news or read about it I'm usually thinking blame the video game instead of the player that's idiotic blame the person playing the game not the game itself.
20440,"One thing i was always asking myself is, why the fuck are FOX News still such a big deal, and why are people watching this bullshit in the usa?"
20441,"I hope the producers of Mojo loose a loved one during a war or at an act of crime. Then, the murder scene's of these people are turned into game's. Maybe then, they won't mock it so much on the next episode."
20442,"number 1? agreed. shooter games causing real life events is bullsh*t. what about medieval battles? they were experienced in life by many, but did they make them run around with swords and kill innocent citizens? no more than games making people kill now. it is minority. just some psychos getting the idea how to do so, but the seed for this behavior lays in brain, not the activities we enjoy. it is like saying that teletubies make boys like women accessories or clothing. if there is something inside of you that makes you like something games/media can just expose it to you but not force you. you will have to force yourself..."
20443,or you could just ban guns in the US?
20444,Video games does not make us violent but lag does!
20445,people who blame video games are idiots
20446,"To be honest, Pokemon gets a bit of a free pass. It's kind of messed up that the game is basically glorified cockfighting."
20447,"on the pokemon issue, and the stupid religious asshole, I just wish we could live on a world without religion."
20448,I'VE NEVER ONCE HEARD ONE PERSON IN THE NEWS WHO WAS SO AMPED AFTER PLAYING A VIDEO GAME THAT THEY HAD TO KILL SOMEBODY IF ANYTHING IT PROB. HELPS BLOW OFF STEAM
20449,"Crazy christian people, pokemon was thought up by a bunch of Japanese geeks, not witches or witchcraft. Another thing, i did have a hard time pulling the trigger in the mw2 airport scene, i pulled the trigger and killed around 2 people."
20450,Pure overreaction. People at cnn and what not just need something absurd in their title to attract audiences.
20451,"Pokemon isn't evil, just need to say that to all you stupid f***s that love to kill dreams. All of you just need to shut up, and go die in a hole, or something."
20452,"it is the most annoying thing when people blame video games for other peoples' violence, as if there wasn't violence in movies or shows or just out in general before video games came to be."
20453,"Its so obnoxious when people simple blame video games on shootings/violence. There is literally NO evidence that even hints games cause violence.
By that dickless fool jack thomson's logic: playing a shooter games turns people into crazed gunmen, so with that in mind why haven't most of us became plumbers and started stomping on turtles while eating mushrooms?"
20454,Bet that hatred game is gonna have some people talking
20455,#10 most realistic sex acts ever concieved? BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH thats a good one. Live action sex scenes can't possibly compare.
20456,"the stupidity of the media is amazing watching this how over the top it gets when they find something in the criminals home that ""could be a cause for them doing this!"""
20457,"I hate people who say video games cause violence. I've been playing video games for YEARS now and I have never thought of or wanted to massacre someone or something. It's not just like ""Wow! Battlefield 4 is so great! I'm gonna go shoot up my classmates!"" No it's not like that the person has to have a mental disorder you can't just blame it on video games!"
20458,Gotta love the retards at fox news.
20459,"Just think, in 20 years or so most of the politicians/news reporters will be gamers and the world will be a much more laid back place as people can vent there instead of in each other faces. Cant wait."
20460,"Not that I support any claims made to the act of video games inducing violence,or all the arguments spanning all over this thread,I must say this was a very interesting watch as a fellow gamer! very entertaining,good job watch mojo,even though I will disagree with some of your listings to other videos :)."
20461,"I hate people video games are life so go fuck your 
Self if you se other wise "
20462,"Politics and conservatives need to keep their noses out things they know nothing of. But at the same time, one can only thank them for boosting the reputation of a game for labeling it as ""controversial"" Either way, the games always win."
20463,Lol Sexbox?
20464,"most kids play games, most games involve virtual guns, when a kid kills someone, odds are he has played a game with a virtual gun, just in the same way he probably had seen bambee when he was very young."
20465,"Yes, Infinity Ward knew what they were doing with ""No Russian."" That's why they made it optional to play, with no penalty to achievements/trophies."
20466,And today the controvers game is HATRED
20467,i kind of want to play those pokemon flash games that peta made. they look hilarious lol
20468,I'm sick of the republicans taking away my second amendment right to bear games. Games don't kill people people kill people.
20469,They are just games. Jesus christ are the press absolute morrons?
20470,No that's fucked up it not fucking video game u stupid bitches
20471,"And there goes fox again, being the dumb asses of America..."
20472,Only normal people can tell the difference from reality and a video game.
20473,"people kill people, video games do kill people ......seriously whens the last time you saw a video game hold any ikind of weapon.........thats right never cuz ininanimate objects dont have brains nor lets and arms to do things with so yet again people kill people not video games. i know that the media is just looking for some thing to blame on mass killings."
20474,.......pokemon....being demonic...........yea.....right.......religious asshats......
20475,"Blame video games because of mass shootings is so stupid. Government just doesn't want to solve real problems. Of course, it's so much easier to blame games."
20476,"Tip about the ""oh mass shooting"" bullshit well, you are MORE LIKELY to be shot to DEATH in your BEDROOM ASLEEP by either Local Law Enforcement OR Federal Law Enforcement. That's something to think of..."
20477,I have now just realized how much I hate the American media...a little late maybe
20478,"Let us remember that most of them, so called, progressive, activist for, whatever shit-- also don't like guns, self defense and, in fact by the fact of being agesnt something else-- Encourage Rape amongst women!.... Who would have guessed?..."
20479,whoever says pokemon is satanic is a fucking moron fuck religion and all that shit!
20480,"If it helps, Steven Colbert from the Colbert Report makes fun of the people who connect gaming to mass shootings. I work at a GameStop and I feel proud when a mother denies a game for her child due to the ESRB Rating system, because a lot of people dont seem to understand that kids 16 and under cant buy M rated games, I personally blame the parents of these kids."
20481,People like to cry and point fingers. If we didn't have games they would find something els to blame.
20482,"Man, fuck Fox News"
20483,think of the people who say those things about video games most of them if not all of them haven't played them there stating thing about them with no prior knowledge what so ever most of the people who do these things have moderate to extreme mental disablitys
20484,Always bring it on cheer games which video games don't make people violent it's just the fact that people if you have a violent if you have a violent violent tendencies will do something while you'll find a way to fix that problem you find a way to compensate with that problem you wanted to kill you're not going to stop anyone so just stop people are violent because they have if they have a really intense is there a violent tendencies are going to find a way to make those in attendance he's away and find a way to compensate it
20485,YogscastKIIIIIMMMMM
20486,"I find all that shit about Pokemon very stupid. Seriously, promoting witchcraft?! Its like they were desperate to find a reason to ban it. Well, you know what they should ban? Seminars about banning games for the stupidest reasons."
20487,"Just come out and do the list you want to do and everyone wants to see: ""Top 10 people/groups in the world that need to be cruelly murdered for the good of all mankind.""
Guy talks about how Mortal Kombat makes people really kill people? Kill him in the most ironic way by actually doing something previously seen as a Mortal Kombat fatality. Extra points if you can pull off one of the supernatural ones.
Someone embarrasses himself by publicly claiming Pokmon is satanic? Kill him in an authentic blood sacrifice. Not satanic, because that doesn't fucking happen. But the Mayans had that shit down to an art. And everyone still remembers them from that calender of theirs.
Someone claims that video games are responsible for school shootings? Death by shooting squad consisting solely of school kids that volunteer after playing too much Call of Duty. If you can find any. I doubt it."
20488,It's not only Conservatives that blame shootings in video games. Liberals and Democrats do it as well.
20489,Doesn't everyone love fox news?
20490,"Everytime a massacre is blamed on a school shooting, I honestly want to hit someone"
20491,"Games dont make people bad or violent, unless you are talking about mentally unstable people that have noconsciousness of what is right or what is wrong, or whats real and whats not. Now those people need to be kept away from the Rated M games!"
20492,people are so annoying If you want to complain about violent video games stop doing what inspires the game in the first place!?!?! God damn people always ruining the fun! Gets me so pissed!!! No wonder why so many video games have politicans as bad guys! They screw up everything!
20493,Video game guns keep kids from using real ones.
20494,"all women are hoes, even my stinking ass mother"
20495,"Personally speaking. Not once have I seen a single news post whinging about video game violence in the UK. This leads me to assume that American press are just a big group of 'hungry' vultures looking for a story no matter how ridiculous. Seriously, how do games such as Halo or COD cause homicidal intent? Tell me."
20496,Hey that was Kim from the Yogscast. Did no one care about that?
20497,"So if games cause violence, then i'm assuming that ace combat 3 will make me a great pilot, gran turismo or forza will make me an excellent race car driver, cooking mama makes me an iron chef, and goat simulator will turn me into the greatest goat. Go figure."
20498,"The gamers know damn well that video games do not make us violent. It is just a massive media gold mine for them to pursue for more viewers of their newspaper and channels, which makes them rich beyond any other news article.
I for one have grown playing the most violent and gore video games since my toddler times. Dozen years later I still enjoy them, like Mortal kombat 9 and the new upcoming one, Gears of war, call of duty, deadspace, bla bla bla, the list is endless.
You do not see me nor any of my friends who do the same going out in the streets killing people are having social problems in their life or any sort of issue. Damn stupid old generation people just do not understand video games, because they do not play them. And do not even get me started with the stupid statement when someone says: ""I have played video games, too. I played super mario on nintendo's first consoles, or something as soft as that"". Just because you have played couple games here and there does not make you know what gaming is."
20499,It's like saying the gun killed him oh wait they are hmmm our government and society is weird
20500,America dont you have something better to do from blaming video games seriusly wtf pokemon teaches witchcraft seriusly stop selling guns legally and then blame video games for murders and shit
20501,"Gah gta cod and all that is just so you don't do it in real life such as gta killing people,having woot woot just on a screen and i can see how it can make people bad but :P"
20502,7:34 Wtf?
20503,God news people-ITS JUST A FUCKING GAME!!!YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT THAT ONE 5 YEAR OLD KID WHO PLAYS MORTAL KOMBAT CAN RIP OFF SOMEONES HEAD?YOUE LOGIC DAMNIT!
20504,"I don't understand how its socially acceptable to watch all the violent TV and listen to music with lyrics crossing over the line of offensiveness, but if you replace either with video games you're suddenly a 200 loser living in your parents basement or a violent psychopath."
20505,Fallout 3 Fat Man Controversy?
20506,"seriously... news love to blame video game... ''oh video game did this'' ''oh video game did that'' ''oh video game is too much this'' cmon, why they not say how video game are god for mind, reflexe and... just being fun... they critic GTA, manhunt, doom... they don't say how much The Journey is relaxing and fun, how much animal crossing is just funny... and how other video game are just a gateaway of.... reality... no... they need to say how BAAAAAD video game are..."
20507,Lol I love how most of the newscasts are from Fox News. Lolol :D
20508,The whole Manhunt 2 thing pissed me off immensely! It also dashed my dreams of a Manhunt 3! But it's cool. I have a PC version!
20509,I killed ants because of games they are to blame
20510,6:21 Did he really just say that MW2 was REALISTIC? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA pissed my pants i laughed so hard.
20511,I'm Australian I wanted to play with a anal prob our government are just assholes
20512,"The behavioral issue claims are SOOOOOOOOOO infuriating. I mean people are saying that games like Battlefield, Dead Space and Just Cause to be the cause of horrible, traumatizing events, when really it's just lack of attention, mental problems, or other things wrong with their brains! we're not the ones to blame!"
20513,I specifically remember walking into my local Australian game store and seeing SR4 on the shelf rated R18+
20514,COD lets you be a terrorist throughout the entire modern series. The no Russian mission is just one example. And how is Doom Satanic? You KILL demons in that franchise!
20515,Its funny how FOX News is the only one that cares lol
20516,"The thing that makes me the most angry is that the news negatively talks about these games with no prior knowledge, other than what they were told, and for example, a game in which the main character is forced to kill to stay alive (Saw, Silent Hill, Resident Evil, etc.) can be misconstrued as ""Meaningless Violence"" when in fact these games were meant to tell a story, or in fact, to give an alternate scenario to everyday life, and it's not like people use games to plan attacks or anything, who in their right mind would base an attack on something like GTA? I mean honestly, unless it's the kind of person that thinks cheat codes work in real life, I see no mortar in any case against video games. as for the war game about fallujah, I can see what they mean about the message not being clear, but then again, if they had made the game single player and only used it to tell the story, it would be no worse than the History channel game about World war I."
20517,"Hate when people target random subjects like this. Whether it's games, music or even something natural like sex there's always somebody there. Don't like violent games? Don't play them. Don't like some types of music? Don't listen to it. Don't like sex? Don't have it. Don't like your rights been taken away? Don't try to take ours away.

20518,I love gta San addreas
20519,3.21 can go fuck himself. As an Australian all I can say is you're a useless softcock.
20520,Don't start with gta v or GTA iv or San Andreas
20521,"lol, I love that News Heading: ""SE""XBOX?"
20522,I'm waiting on a game to feature 9/11 as an opening so people could really lose their shit.
20523,OMG Yogscast Kim is on here lol your advertising other youtube channles
20524,"I laugh when they blame shit on games or movies. It's just funny seeing older people lose their shit about it. ""I blame Tarantino for the school shootings after they said the shooter saw Reservoir Dogs"" or ""I blame Mass Effect for teenagers popping out babies"" or ""I blame Stephen King for the serial killer that killed kids on camp"". No. Stop. People are fucking idiots and are violent by nature, movies, games and books comment on society. It's not their fault that there are mentally challenged people in the world. It's not their fault that because there is religion in the world we have wars. IT'S NOT THEIR FUCKING FAULT! ESPECIALLY WHEN ""THEY"" - YES, THE FUCKING GAMES WE PLAY AND MOVIES WE WATCH AND BOOKS WE READ - ARE BASED OFF OF THE REAL LIFE PSYCHOTICS AND MISHAPS OF OUR WORLD. So yeah. Fuck you, you miserable old bastards that can't find a valid excuse."
20525,"Look I play fps games all the time. But do you see me shooting up schools or any of that? No because the key element in all of this is the sanity and or gullibility of those who are playing these games. Grow the fuck up people and acknowledge the facts, don't buy a ""violent"" game for your dumbass retard you call a kid if you KNOW that their fucked up in the head."
20526,such bullshit its just old cunts scared of chnage because they never had games like gta when they were younger
20527,I just skip no russian
20528,"is it just me, or does everyone else really not like the watch mojo voice over person being a guy?"
20529,"We can always rely on gta to make an ever so controversial appearance on the news; wow, sometimes i love to see how stupid people can be."

20532,"I really wish I could see Manhunt and it's plot, along with Manhunt 2!
I mean, not for the sake of seeing the gore, just for the sake of seeing the reason WHY the manhunt is happening.
Jesus, these people need to calm the hell down!
The six days in fallujah thing is stupid... Why can't you just make a game and not get hate? Especailly if it has to do with war! These are meant for simulations, not COMEDY, but even if they do laugh, it's a game for christ's sake! The point is entertainment!"
20533,So if racing games work the same. I will be a street racer or race car driver.

20535,i love the last video clip as it is pretty much one of the real reasons the tragic public shootings happen. not because they played FPS games.
20536,The Fallujah one pisses me off.
20537,"The medias logic is so flawed saying violent video games cause these mass shootings in schools, then why arn't there hundreds of thousands of them and in other countries beside America.... Really"
20538,"Pokemon, black Satanic magic- seriously? LmFao... I admit it is a little sad and low trapping monsters/creatures in a BALL and enslaving them to FIGHT other ""trainers"" but it's a great RPG idea so ... and as for people who whine and bitch that games are addictive and have violence ... well ... let's see... you THINK? It's like saying ""McDonalds WILL make you fat."" No... only if you overindulge in it, lmao."

20542,God I hate those fucking easily-offended dickheads.. they're just never happy and so want to pass on their miserable lives to everyone else who is enjoying a game.
20543,The girl discussing the D.C. shooting and gta v was absolutely correct.
20544,Pokemon demonic and promote witchcraft? I guess church are quite desperate now days...I like how they accuse without even trying to find out the truth.
20545,"The Fallujah game sufferd the ""too soon"" problem."
20546,"at 8:30 , the one with line art graphics... what the name of the game?"
20547,Video games are invented to escape reality. I laugh when i run people over in GTA but i dont go out and run people over in real life to see if its fun. I know that its not fun and that in video games its okay because it is fake and not real. (Even though i started to cry when GTAV made me torcher that guy :c )

20550,"the thing that drives me crazy is the fact reporters blame mass shootings like Columbine on gaming but glide over the fact that a bunch of high schoolers bought automatic submachine guns at a flea market. or at sandy hook where a mentaly incapable individual had his mother buy him guns for ""bonding purposes"".  I CALL MORE BULLSHIT THAN A COW FARM!!!"
20551,no russian is my favourite cod mission ever
20552,Fox news.. always to blame virtual guns instead of real guns.. lol Steve Douchey
20553,Don't you just love Fox News. They tell their viewers how wonderful real guns are and then scream bloody murder when people use fake ones.
20554,This was hard to watch purely because of how fucking stupid some people can be lol.
20555,if you are mature the game should be sold to you if youre a 7 year old with grandma stick to mario
20556,I guess there was no #10 Pretty mediocre video in whole.
20557,lmfao the pokemon one was hilarious...like you can't be serious
20558,"If anything, my innumerablerampages on GTA games taught me this - shooting random bystandersis really boring, and I'd rather do something more productive in-game, and IRL :/"
20559,People are just to fucking hypersensitive!
20560,man i would have loved to play that game. I see it as a tribute to all the people who lost their lives
20561,"REALLY??? The game LITERALLY says at the beginning that there is a moment on the game that may disturb some players, and when you go to the mission, the game says (at the briefing) what's going to happen, then the game has a menu pop up that this is a disturbing scene in the game and gives the option to skip. And people STILL cry over it?? It's like installing a language filter then people getting mad that they have language -_-"
20562,this is stupid as fuck its a video game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
20563,ok fps games dont do that i play them a lot it the person not the game get it though your head
20564,"Something that isn't really video game controversy is when that girl burned her house down and try to kill her family. The media blamed SLENDER. I kinda get it. But then, they blamed SOUL EATER!!!! But the blamed it for the most stupid reason ever, two characters were having an argument. That's what it was WORD FOR WORD."
20565,People will always find something to complain about. Nothing is ever perfect. Even if perfection was attainable there'd still be people looking for faults to complain about. Why not focus on what you like?
20566,i hate dumbasses blaming games for violence crime where worse back in the day when video games didn't exist + fox please have interesting news
20567,"6:20
and its VERY realistic.
sorry but if people dont actually die how the fuck is it realistic?"
20568,"seriously?
you don't laugh when you die in a video game
when you die you either do nothing or rage (unless the way you died was the stupidest way possible).
I really hat people like this coz they think games that are based on WW2 are okay (were 6 million people died in the holocaust) but making a game based on a more recent war (with less deaths) isn't."
20569,They DO realise that there more bloodier battles and killings before shooters and video games
20570,"Pfft, some people.
They're just games!"
20571,Super Columbine RPG. That game got to much hate. Especially from the people who've never had the balls to play it.
20572,"I like all these instances of the U.S congress taking offense over video game violence. Perhaps video game makers should take Congress to task over its ongoing military adventures - Afghanistan, Iraq, etc. Which, last time I checked, didn't involve a whole lot of hugging and sharing. And doesn't Congress have bigger fish to fry anyways? How about the economy, assholes? No wonder their approval rating is so low."
20573,FUCK THE PEOPLE WHO BANNED GAMES IN AUSTRAYA
20574,"lets get one thing straight, i'm a gamer. i love video games so much, it's borderline obsessive. but seriously, i can not believe that people are disrespecting the woman who lost her son in war. you say she is selfish? how selfish is it of you to want to play a fucking video game so bad that you're going to shit over someone's grief? 
and on a side note, i laughed my ass off when that guy was talking about how satanic pokemon is. gotta catch em all... for satan. o_o"
20575,"Anyone who sits there and says ""oh i got it from a video game"" is seriously fucked in the head. like the 2 little shit teenagers who killed a couple and blamed it on GTA III, or the guy who stole a car then executed 2 police officers, a dispatcher, and stole a police car and blamed it on GTA SA, my point is the parents are the ones to blame reason being they buy these games which have a T or M rating and their little ass's are usually ages 6-15 not to mention companies like rockstar make it known they are not liable for any acts or recreations that people do because its a video game, and i mean really why does a 6 year old feel the need to play a game like GTA V? for one the kid is immature and to it gives them the idea to act out and then turn around and blame it on a game, like the 10 year old boy who shot his little sister. So i have this to say blame the parents for not monitoring their children."
20576,I saw Yogcast Kim!!!!!!
20577,Fox News Live!
20578,Been playing M games since the age of five ( Mortal Kombat being my first video game ) and I haven't had one thought of murder on my mind!
20579,"I love all this Fox News footage, it's so credible..."
20580,"I'm surprised you didn't mention Outlast or the DLC for Outlast. There's heavy nudity, violence, and even rape in those games, a lot of which is distrubing for an audience 18 and over, let alone a younger audience."
20581,"The last clip on the ""6 Days in Fallujah"", whoever that news-person was, they remind me of my relatives. A condescending and passive aggressive asshole who says something insanely anger inducing, just as they move to talk to somebody else... Seriously, what even."
20582,"American news is just flat out fucking retarded, that is all."
20583,"Wooooow.. ""no Russian"" from modern warfare 2 is in there... pa-fuckin-thetic.. its just a game.. its not like it has effect on people in real life to kill lots of other people........... ok some people but not all people.."
20584,"There is one thing though that we all should realize about the No Russian part in mw2, nobody ever tells us to shoot"
20585,i just hate it when ppl blame shootings on games like gta or cod
20586,ridiculous They use to say that opera and opera houses was corrupting the young minds of the old times. how can a game kill some one go ahead go buy one and and ask it to kill poeple its going to lie there motionless just like a gun would just lie there it has to be picked up with intent from its owner and i dont see a game being picked up with intention to hurt someone and im shure konami would have made that game awsome and held teh memory of everyone in regard as they have sometimes done
20587,Hmm so this kid shot 10 people in a school. Well why would he do tha.... Ohhh look he used to play call of duty.. Just like all the other 70 million people that play that game....
20588,custers revenge lmao
20589,Politicians and news people are morons.
20590,"-_- Maybe we're looking at this the wrong way around.What if those people who go out on killing sprees buy 1st person shooters because they like killing people, instead of going out on killing sprees because they like the game.
This seems far more likely to me."
20591,YEAH lets blame videogames! but lets not blame the parents for the education they give their sons!
20592,time to add gamergate to the list
20593,we get it...fox news and the right are evil. sheesh.
20594,"If computer games cause mass shootings, why are the vast majority of these shootings in America?"
20595,what about rapelay?
20596,It didn't piss me off but the first mission of COD Bo where u had to kill Castro. There was some talk about that
20597,where is counter-strike cmon
20598,how about jut admitting your kid is a fucking crazy psycho lunatic
20599,Hatred is gonna start sooo much shit i don't even wanna know
20600,How can pokemon be bad ???
20601,It's a good thing all the parents of WW2 soldiers are dead...
20602,"""Video game makes fun of adoption""
THAT'S IT I AM DONE."
20603,People are really sick. What is wrong with Pokemon ?!
20604,Why adults killing our time for dumb things its only a video game plus leave us alone let us have fun playing video games ok
20605,"Figures, the Canadian broadcast is the most rational"
20606,"I own every one of these games. Minus Fallujah and Custer's Revenge, of course."
20607,"It really makes me angry when all these people jump on the whole "" video games are bad for our kids"" bandwagon. Video games don't cause kids to snap and do bad things, bad parenting does."
20608,Breaking news! Reports say that a lunatic who killed 100 people... Played Minecraft. Could it be that minecraft is causing behavioral problems with kids? Maybe we should ban it and give kids an extra hour of school to fill their minds with stuff they enjoy! Like math! Because who da heck doesn't like math...
20609,Payday 2 teach you how to rob banks...
20610,"when it came to six day's in fallujah,i say shut the fuck up all you anti-war activists and people who are like ""My child never had that choice."" They were gonna be honored in that game,and you just felt like being an idiot and flaming them about it being about war."
20611,"Its True weither you like it or not Video Games can psychologically change a person to become more violent, but not just video games, Movies, Newspapers, Books, anything can psychologically change a person for the good or for the bad. If a person is always enjoying violence he may become used to violence, if a person is always enjoying racing he may like to do things fast, etc. I play BF4 and GTAV but I know there is a barrier between real life and video games. Sadly some people don't."
20612,"They are video games. Simple as that. They are for entertainment kinda like movies. Most parents don't let their kids watch porn or R rated movies for obvious reasons, but those same parents will buy their kid a m rated game then complain the is inappropriate material in the game. There is ratings on everything now tv, movies, games, and even apps try using them instead of blaming the developer."
20613,omg I played mortal kombat I guess that made me a killer news reporters need to get there heads out of there asses for once and actually look for evidence and not just blame it on a stupid video game
20614,hahaa so much fox news
20615,Really? Pokemon teaching kids to cast spells? I have officially lost all faith in the christian god and all who follow him.
20616,why no russian my mother walked up to me and assked what are you doing? i responed killing inncent civillians in a airport and she went oh! then laughed and walked away
20617,In that mw2 mission I didn't kill anyone......ok maybe 1 or 2....ok ALL OF THEM
20618,"I am a christian... I love the Lord... that being said -If you don't like the games... don't play them. If you think they are too controversial for your children... here is an idea - BE A PARENT!!!
For those who have a problem with the violence... Have you even read the Old Testament? God was a pretty vengeful and violent God."
20619,some of these are complete over reactions but a lot are of them are uhhhh yeah......
20620,The only reason people blame video games is because it is an easy scapegoat and what seems an easy solution to our problems
20621,MURICA! Where people blame video games for everything! -_- this country... where has it gone!
20622,"Americans raging over Pokemon being 'satanic', face palm to the max"
20623,"What pisses me off is that people actually think video games are what causes violence. There has been violence in the 1800's, were there video games then? No."
20624,if your going to ban games then ban TV because it has just as much vilence
20625,"Geez.. They're just games... And it's not the creators fault careless parents buy M rated games for their kids... I don't really think games cause violence. For me, games give me a sense of freedom to do whatever the hell i want with no punishment, and it's a pretty good stress reliever.. .-. I don't know if this ruins the first thing i said buuuut wutever i just wanted to speak my mind."
20626,That woman at the very end was superb. Succintly highlighting the problem that many are willing to overlook. Mental illness needs more awareness in the general public.
20627,"Portal didn't make fun of adoption. My gosh....why is CNN and FOX so butthurt about everything. If you want free speech you have to listen to everybody else's, deal with it."
20628,I've just played 10 mins of gta v now I'm feeling the urge to single handedly take a tank from a secure military base and go on a killing rampage through my town ya know like the millions of other people that have played this and other games similar
20629,I liked that lady at the end. :)
20630,damn moralfags let us enjoy our games! Better we kill in games than release our desires in RL
20631,"God i hate fox news they're always putting up retarded arguments. Wow the government should see how much you play everyday, great idea lady. The reason these shootings happen every week is because you sell guns to psychopaths. But the damn government is looking for an escape goat, which are the games that are being sold. Instead of bickering and wasting time on prosecuting games, why not just do a gun law saying you pass the mental state test then you can own a gun. Why do you need a gun? For safety come on. The only viable reason for a gun is hunting, thats it."
20632,Mortal Combat Blood Code. I still remember. A B A C A B B. FINISH HIM.
20633,Was that Kim from Yogscast interviewing the guy?! OOOOSH
20634,7:52 Jack Thompson.
20635,its so fucking stupid and angering when people just blame video games for problems that are arising
20636,That airport mission is pretty fucked up.
20637,"Here's the thing, video games have rating on them for a reason. Don't let people who aren't old enough play certain games because then you do get problems like people thinking guns and war and mass murder are jokes. But if you following the logic that violent video games re bad in general then think about it like this: I watch NICS, CSI, Hawaii five-0. Because I watch so much of that I could in theory pull off the perfect crime, but no one has made serious threats about taking these shows off air. If we banned guns then people who follow the law and don't own a gun are going to be in trouble because criminals will still have theirs. If I set a gun on a table it's wont shoot you, I have to pull the trigger. So yeah gun violence would go down but then we'd just find other ways to kill each other. If you ask me people should have to get checked for any serious mental issues before they are allowed a gun. Because it's mostly mentally unstable people who go on rampages not dumb teenagers who sit on their butts gaming or adults who game in their spare time."
20638,"I hate when these kind of stories go on the news it pisses me off, u see there's two types of gamers who play violent video games, 98% of them play them for entertainment and to get rid of stress, and the other 2% are the dumb asses that play violent games like call of duty, grand theft ect. And think that it's ok to shoot someone in the face and or run over people and rob stores. and when people who r part of that 2% do this dumb shit and think they can get away with it they get on the news and these news reporters and politicians say ""o video games r bad because this one guy was playing a violent video game 10 hours before he killed this person and video games should be banned  because of this..."" And I'm just sitting here thinking "" o my god this one person out of about 20 million people who play this violent game called call of duty just so happened to kill a person o my god what a coincidence it has to be call of duty"" and let me say something else like they said in the video there has been numerous tests out there that have monotured thousands Mabey even millions of 7-10 year old kids who play violent video games and about 8 years later the kids have grown and surprise surprise nothing has changed with them they haven't done any bad things so this proves that video games r not bad and to all the people who disagree with me your wrong"
20639,i hate how mainstream media covers area they don't know about at ALL!
20640,My god I hate people who come up with controversies they shouldn't be token this seriously
20641,"insert peter griffin: OMG WHO THE HELL CARES?!?! thats more directed towards the news casters and others who have issues and nit-pick at a game. now insert frozen: Let it go, let it gooooo..."
20642,I still have mad world for the wii xD
20643,what game is 8:31?
20644,Fox News: Making enemies since 1996.
20645,I hate when people say their kids act like this because of video games they play well you should only be 17 or older the play it
20646,"If i would create a game, i would make it so gory, so disturbing, so ofensive. feturing rape, murder, racing, robbing, piracy, gore, racing, gambeling, porn, drugs, alcohol, horror, gaming, torture, cars, bikes, trucks, helicopters, planes, money, death, insaneasylum's, terrorism, and many things more. one of the missions, murder an republican news cast :)
all this, just to make them shit bricks!!!! :3"
20647,"I love the hypocrisy of these fox news right wingers , video games are so obscene, they're violent , they're addictive , they teach kids to be violent etc . etc. And then go around  on the same news channel and say ""we should bomb anyone who threatens america ! Can't use napalm anymore ? Good ! Cause white phosphorus is much worse ! """
20648,"this is stupid, if people kill, its because they aren't mentally stable, not because of video games"
20649,"So videogames that simulate killing people are bad? But all of these rap songs about killing people are just fine? I'm not against music, but I'm just saying. These people are retardedly biased against videogames. When people with mental problems kill people in real life, they blame videogames. Not the government for making guns so easily accessible. Not bad parenting causing the people to not learn that killing people is bad. If that person purchased a single violent videogame, they automatically blame videogames, saying how videogames caused the person to shoot other people in real life. Just look how many people will play call of duty advanced warfare or any other fps. Not even 1% of these people go and shoot others in real life. Where's the opposing argument now?"
20650,Your watching WBTV channel 3news at 5:00 AM where your never more that 7 minutes away from traffic and weather... Now we turn it over to Ashley Beaty with your five day forecast LOL
20651,"they showed my local channel 3 news based in Charlotte, NC twicethat's awesome!"
20652,fuck fox
20653,"The ""no russian"" motto should be adopted by more people"
20654,"what is pissing me off right now is that upcoming game hatred. It's not that it'll cause Violence in kids and stuff, we've pretty much proved that it doesn't. But the Game is so hate filled and kill crazy The Press is going to have Field days for over a year. and god forbid if another shooting occurs that game will be right up there in the blame game and it's going to fuck it up for everyone."
20655,I agree all this is bad but for the love of God don't blame video games for this it's the people playing the game not the video game
20656,"Mass murder makes me happy!
Dead bodies make me happy!
Say what you will of me!
I'll always have juggalo family!"
20657,"Looks like you're going to have to remake this list if this Hatred stuff gets any more out of hand.
Honestly I don't think Hatred is any worse than games like Postal, Manhunt, or GTA. But I guess people will bitch about anything.
Games are just that games They don't cause violence. Violence is caused by people, generally with some sort of problem and should seek help."
20658,Fucking everything has to do with video games a person blinks he played video games that's why he blinked I fucking hate this new generation  who remembers the 90s?
20659,5:00 pissed me off so much.
20660,"First they blamed books, then music, movies, comics and now video games for violence. No one wants to take the blame, so they point to the entertainment the aggressor liked."
20661,"lol when that kid shot his mom 21 times with his 22. and then tryed to rape her... and they blame it on cod
lol"
20662,Stupid Fox News. Always have been a bunch sissies.
20663,What ticks me off is when they blame a game for a mass shooting they forget to mention that other countries buy and play the same exact game they are railing against than the US and they don't have the mass shooting. Then they say stuff about doing something about mental illness here in the US and then a week later you don't here shit about anyone doing anything about mental illness.
20664,"People need to get over themselves, video games don't make people violent, Some people are just so messed up that they don't want to blame it on mental illness, they just want to target the market, by saying it's the game's fault they did this or did that."
20665,they should see the modern mortal kombat.
20666,Number one is exactly the reason why I never watch FOX News
20667,Jinx is actually based on a Japanese mystical figure known as yama uba
20668,watching stupid people say entertainment is the root of all tragedy makes me sick
20669,WTF is with that voice croaking over the audio at 5:28?!?
20670,Postal 2?
20671,Why are people blaming shootings on using virtual guns and not the ease of purchase of REAL GUNS? Or am I oversimplifying?
20672,"i cant stand fox news
they can sucka my dick"
20673,"To be honest, this is all bullshit."
20674,"6:22 Instead of people, it says ppl on the bar on the newscast"
20675,I think there's something to no.1. Ever sice i started playing Super Mario as a child i have been jumping on my pets.
20676,why all of your videos are on 480p max and there's no HD options? it's way better to watch all of your video in a great High Definition
20677,this makes me want to go listen to Lavender town's Japanese theme
20678,Pathetic just pathetic if some idiot goes on a rampage then its not video games to blame you have to be fucked in the head to do that shit damn governments are just looking for a fallback
20679,Why blame video games for mass shooting ?? I dont get it even movies and news has videos of explosion and shooting so you should ban them too.
20680,Pokemon taught me why gambling is a bad idea.
20681,When you realize in the mission no Russian you didn't have to shoot the civilians and still complete the mission.
20682,in real life gamers are really smart it took scientist a year to finish a mind game but for a gamer 3 months
20683,"Just wait, Hatred gonna go nr. 1, a new amok simulator. like who the fuck wanna play such shit. sick people."
20684,Yes alien sex is the most realistic sex scene ever.I'm tired of dumbasses.
20685,"pokemon should have been higher on the list, it kinda is the original controversy game.. it gets attacked by everyone even nintendo haters stopped hating on the game.."
20686,"-About number one.
It's just that those fuckwits just want something to blame."
20687,The media need to grow a pear people don't kill because of games.
20688,Any mainstream news station is full of manipulation and lies.
20689,Fuck fox news
20690,"sigh
So school shooters play violent videogames? well, it souldn't surprise that violent people play violent games - it's not the games that makes them violent. Someone with homocidal tendencies probably wont find much enjoyment in a ""my little pony""-game.
Besides... school shooters also watch TV... and go to school. That doesn't mean that going to school causes people to do school shootings (although to shoot a gun at school you obviously have to go there first)."
20691,really well done list (y)
20692,"People are fine with this sort of thing in books and films, but put it in a video game and then, ""Whoah! That's not cool! We need to keep this out of people's hands, it's dangerous!""
It's not the existence of the controversy that makes me nonplussed: it's the fact that the people who place the blame on the games have either nothing at stake and decided just to be asshats about it; or they can't take responsibility for something they had a hand in and just happened to have found a convenient target that can't defend itself."
20693,Grand Theft Auto taught me how to fight bullies but i didn't know the same developer made another game about that
20694,Wat u say about my homies and brothers from Australia
20695,POKEMON IS WITCHCRAFT???? LOL!! I love my charizard :3
20696,"""Pokemon is satanic!""
That's just the tip of the iceberg on what that idiot and others like him talk about. Want proof? Type in ""Crazy Christians"" on the search panel and you'll see. Apparently, to them, every cute, fictional character is evil."
20697,"Some people just have to find something to criticize, Seriously though, sex scenes in Mass Effect aren't even that great nor that long, or graphic for that matter. People read to much into things like that. ""Video game makes fun of orphans"", you're stupid if you think they were trying to put adopted children down. It was a joke! Chell is adopted, Weatly was trying to mock her. Failing, I might add."
20698,well now i know why we dont have good games......well done congress of the world! ....you are ruining everything!
20699,"I'm surprised that FourDeltaOne's AlterIWNet was not on here. It was probably the biggest disaster for Activision EVER! Only the people who used it really knew about it... but... still it was a big deal and they became millimeters from getting sued. It was down for a few years, however I recently saw that it was back up... I don't know how..."
20700,"The problem is that idiotic people fail to realize.... ITS A GAME!!! Games are meant to push the boundaries between real life and the imagination. Just because other idiots try to recreate or act on impulses they see / do in a game, doesnt make it the game's fault."
20701,Good thing in Australia we now have a patch for the PC version of L4D2 where we can see the same images that everyone else can.
20702,"It's cus anglos always have to blame someone else for their fuckups. ""My kid has adhdd, it's now the system's problem, not mine"" ""she got knocked up, it's my cousin's neighbor former roommate fault,  not mine"" ""they all were playing the knock out game, and I'm divorced, It's his father's fault his potential victim had a gun and shot him"" smh..."
20703,"I hate it when people say ""video games cause violence"" no its not so shut up"
20704,Thrill Kill for PS1 was also banned
20705,Nothing ruins anything worse then Fundamentalist Christians... Westboro baptist massacre anyone?
20706,"As much as I like being evil in video games and enjoy killing innocents in ""video games"". At least I don't get thoughts about killing a innocent."
20707,"If I ever created a videogame I would make it so violent, so disturbing, that people would literally shit bricks over it!"
20708,"no ,a motorcycle, bicycle and anything thing with wheels,would count"
20709,"games don't kill people, people kill people,damn lay off the games, what about back in the old west,are games to blame for people getting killed, and the same during the 20's and 30's and look at some movies,like jason and freddy,do they go and say, well they watched and movie and killed after ,bulls**t"
20710,"To the whole ""guns make people violent"" i think its stupid because the news reporters are going after the easist target and one people will beleive because most shootings the person has a problem to begin with
Its stupid how they just look over everthing and blame games."
20711,"I understand the Fallujah one, but everything else makes me shake my head. Media feeding people lies mayne."
20712,rapelay worst ever
20713,HEY watchmojo there is a new game to add to this list it's called HATRED
20714,No Russian always was my favourite CoD Mission.
20715,"No Russian
One of the most memorable missions in a video game for me. Even though it's disturbing, it sticks in your mind. Video games are like movies, just more intense."
20716,I hate the Mortal Kombat controversy shown in the video. Why? THE FRANCHISE IS FRIGGIN FUN!!
20717,"Good arguments aside, if war activists cared so deeply about peaceful co-existence and non-violent resolution they would put an end to current conflicts rather than criticise video games featuring warfare. Condemning a game while continuing to allow men and women to die in real life without speaking up is a textbook example of hypocrisy and mixed up priorities. Especially in the U.S., why not diffuse situations diplomatically and decline being involved in foreign dissension and tensions militantly. Outrage sparks often when mediums of art are concerned, yet these commentators are not nearly as vocal in regard to real world events. I do not hear any blowing whistles in response to the United States occupation of the Middle East or imposed sanctions on Russia. In my opinion the state of affairs in Ukraine and the Middle East are internal issues that need to be dealt with internally."
20718,CoD: MW3 Airport .....in german version of the game you lose if you shoot at unarmed.
20719,"To answer the question which games annoy me the most: 0 day DLC games, third person view on a pc, bugged AAA games, pricing, presales with known to be Crap productions (EA, Watchdogs, etc.) CONSOLE PORTS
PS i agree with comments below: USA, stop selling guns to citizens it is outrageous. Your doing it to yourself."
20720,"5:32: typical US reporter that does an ""interview"". Translation: just keep talking crap to the ""Guest"" and not giving a chance to reply. Maby they should review the definition of an interview? This country is lost..."
20721,This really shows how insanely stupid the USA media really is. Couple of narcissists shout for attention and ppl actually take it seriously. I play games for over 2 decades and never EVER tried to replay it in real life. Even though a difficult life. All discussions about games CAUSING violence is bogus.
20722,"Lol so Fallujah is not ok cause 800 people died but WW2,where millions died, is ok? double standards everywhere"
20723,"Ok about video games increasing murders with guns, how about don't allow fucking guns to any retards? Jeez. look at the real problem. Having a gun at home should not be normal. here in canada everyone is nice, no need to shoot someone because he walked on your property."
20724,"Video games are art forms, we should enjoy them, not make fake claims against them."
20725,More reasons to hate the media!
20726,How about movies ?
20727,@YOGSCAST Kimguest aappearance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
20728,Wow. I am a Christian and even I laughed at that dude saying Pokemon is demonic. How exactly? It's a video game about some animals you train to battle each other and just brings nostalgia when I think about it. It doesn't make me want to go hurt my dog or kill babies. Relax dude
20729,America. Won't ban guns. Blame video games for school shootings instead... Stupid people haha
20730,2 Days after a car crash. fox blames mario cart for it.
20731,So a game about Marines in Iraq isnt allowed... but killing 400 people in an airport while overpowered with LMGs and MGLs.... that is allowed.... BULLSHIT
20732,"People are stupid, what can you say. i mean some might have good reason, but most of the time it is just press. I also like how we have switched from violent games make murderers, to sexist games make misogynists and rapists. Good going mankind."
20733,"this just shows how annoying sensitive people are, trying to ruin other's experiences because they can't stomach the violence."
20734,You sure this video wasn't made before the Xbone?
20735,"Sorry, I can't stand gory games, but I don't think they should be banned.
I like Medieval 2 where just about all of the violence is implied.
Why do so many games rely on gore and violence to attract people. It seems like a cheap trick to me..."
20736,No Russian my fav CoD mission ever
20737,Maybe all the old heads in Congress should do something about the GUNS instead of the games. Shootings and shit happens andd then the president gets blamed when he literally can't do anything without Congress
20738,"#9WTF!?! Thanks a lot, asshole! My childhood is ruined!!"
20739,"The rage surrounding the Killer Instinct incident at this year's E3 was just plain pathetic. I raise my middle finger high to the over sensitive, pretentious ""SJWs"" that do their utmost to ruin everyone else's day."
20740,"I like how 90% of the news clips shown are fox ""news""...lol what a joke."
20741,MK is number one.
20742,Im really pissed off at the fact that number 3 modern warfare 2 even displayed a message before you even go on the main menu saying there is a mission which you might find distressing and still people are complaining
20743,Its ALWAYS fox news
20744,fatt fatyyy adopted no parents
20745,"MW2 was obviously gonna be on this list, and when are people gonna wake up and realise that these are fucking video games!? They aren't real they are virtual worlds to mess around in! Religious nuts saying that Pokmon is satanic and evil? Total bullshit! What have they been smoking?
Also, I want those games 'Night Trap' and 'Custer's revenge' XD"
20746,Some people lost their Children in Normandy Too didnt stop every ww2 first person shooter from cashing in on that as well. Conkers even Spoofed it in one game. Heck they even showed it in Graphic detail in Saving private Ryan. I know its sad but history needs to be told and Games are great way to tell it
20747,Note how FOX seems to appear the most on this list. I wonder what that means.
20748,"News People Make me mad they blame video-games 24/7 and there was this 1 kid who got a gun and shot his mom and tryed to rape her! and it was a 22 rifle and it was after a kid played call of duty black ops 2! and the said its because of
video games! and to make it worse How would the kid get the gun?? Tell me please!"
20749,random comment
20750,"I finally found it! Gta for kids, Just Cause 2"
20751,"""Video Games are related to mass shootings.""
I have never seen anycontroversy between someone who liked to cook and stabbed some people or burned them."
20752,I mean make you more nice.
20753,They also say that people that are bad people or playing down the EVIL path in video games are actually more nice or good or something IRL ( In real life).
20754,Look it up its true scientists say that video games help hand-eye coordination.
20755,Every one of these pissed me off. its annoying how people blame poor parenting or poor governing on video games.
20756,If i was going to kill somebody as a kid i would leave a note that explains i wasent doing this because i saw it in a videogame. But because i had a reason to kill this person.
20757,"Although I don't believe in blaming media for people mistakes, cause I believe people make their own choices, but I do believe some people don't need to play certain things especially if their young and impressionable. Some people can't separate fiction and reality. Yes in a game you can rob car but you should know you can't do that in real life cause you will go to jail, people who can't separate the two maybe shouldn't play such games"
20758,Rape Lay?????
20759,I have played many FPS games. But I have never gone out on a shooting rampage ever in my life.
20760,"Holy shit Conservatives are stupid! Ban excessive violence and gore in games, and then surprised when people turn to doing it in real life."
20761,The massacre mission in mw2 was a bit too much so i understand the negative media feedback
20762,"The critics blaming video games NEVER mention MOVIES or MUSIC!!!! I know theres been controversy over eminems lyrics, but they never mention all of the INCREDIBLY violent movies. In movies there's REAL PEOPLE, very convincing special effects, realistic make-up for gore, etc. Games arent at the level of realism where it can compete with movies visuals! MILLIONS of these games are bought and the shootings they talk about are rare. If games were the cause- millions of those shootings would happen!!"
20763,in Australia you can now get Saints Row 4 but it's a censored version
20764,Video Games does not effect mass shootings. What the lady said at the ending mental illness is... You don't play Grand Theft Auto and decide i'm going to get up and steal a car and kill some cops on the way.
20765,"Unless you're a gamer, you will never understand video games. I've killed more than 150,000 people on halo 2, 3, reach, and COD but that doesn't mean I think about murdering people in real life. I love competitive games and the strategy behind it. Maybe when eSports becomes bigger than ""real sports"" there will be less hate on the FPS genre from Senators. I mean heck, people once thought that listening to Elvis would corrupt their children and that rock n roll was bad. I feel like there are much bigger issues to deal with than ""violent video games"". I guess movies and tv shows don't count in their eyes. Just let gamers do their thing. Honestly. Oh and one last thing, that pokemon crap..... are you serious?!?!? Witchcraft? Gambling? The point of the game is in the slogan after all, TO CATCH THEM ALL, TO BE THE VERY BEST, TO GET THE BADGES YOU IDIOTS!"
20766,"this is what makes me lose faith in humanity. even the most idiotic person can read the Pokmon controversies and feel like a genius afterwards. Pokmon is satanic? not the only time religion is used as the sole reason to ban something. its not something that teaches kids to become Satanists and perform dark rituals. it was inspired by bug collecting. also, people have no right to complain about the no russian mission. you dont have to do much since civilians dont fight back and your co-terrorists can easily take care of the security, meaning you wont even have to fire a bullet until the military arrives. also, its completely optional. you can skip it if you find the content disturbing and you even get warned when starting a game that a could be offensive level will start. they basically said ""we will show you this. you might not like it and thats fine. im not forcing this on you. you can leave at any moment"" and they STILL complain. seems like people get too much time on their hands
pardon my wall of text"
20767,"No matter how much you argue about violence in games or movies or TV, it all comes down to parental responsibility. The entertainment industry can only do so much. In the end it's the parents who have to police their own kids."
20768,"I feel all are absurd with the exception of No Russian. That was just brutal. It's one thing to kill the ""bad guy,"" but you basically mow down innocent civilians. That's a little much and I'm hardly overly sensitive. I laugh at gore and violence for the most part."
20769,"No.6 so true, we've missed out on some many games due to our tight arse laws, but we finally got Mortal Kombat in the end"
20770,What game was that at 3:27
20771,What about postal 1. you kill kids at a school in that game.
20772,i'm surprised i havent seen Postal 2 here.
20773,So guns dont kill people. People kill people because they played a game. Right? Not because guns are far too easily accessible or sometimes people aren't responsible with them.
20774,"Guns dont kill people. People kill people. Oh, but those newfangled video games? Yea, they kill people."
20775,"The fact that the press and world feel that virtual reality games are to blame for shootings and other incidents, is a very poor excuse. And for kids, parents do not instill the lesson that ""this is a virtual world, not reality"" many don't understand these are meant for you to have fun. That's what the world does not understand. It's a very poor excuse, and something to blame."
20776,Conservatives lol
20777,I'm live in Australia and see those games in video game stores inside supermarkets all the time! Even my friend bought it here!
20778,"Why is it people think video games manipulate people and then immediate turn around and base their lives around ""reality"" television?"
20779,"The Rust controversy, where reports were saying you could rape and kill people for fun (kill yes, but what online RPG doesn't have that, but rape, no) It also said a 10 year old boy was scarred for life and would wake up in cold sweats after he was killed and yelled at by teens after he died. It was so far off what the real game is it was hilarious."
20780,It's so stupid that people are blaming video games for mass shooting when if you look at places with better gun laws like Australia you see that there hasn't been a school shooting sense 2002
20781,"Priest: VIDEO GAMES ARE BAD, THEY ARE SATANIC, THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM GOD!!! BLAH BLAH BLAH!!! 
Meanwhile in heaven... 
God:Just a second honey, ive almost got 100 kills, made it to the top 20, built my house in minecraft, AND gotten my Typhlosion to level 100!!!"
20782,Its just games man people take it so serious now and these days
20783,"I looked at this video, and the news headlines under number 1. One of them said: ""shooter likes a 1st person war game"" which is very stupid to say. What about that person's favorite food? Shooter also likes twinkies! Maybe they should blame twinkies! Maybe they did! Why do you think twinkies stopped being supplied for a while?"
20784,"I would put money on that Call of Duty campaigns are written by the KKK
Just sayin'"
20785,Can somebody help me? I can't seem to find the joystick and buttons on this gun.
20786,I was eager to find out the #1 game. But which was it? Wtf ?
20787,The reason y we play video games is to escape the real world and play a virtual world with no consequences that's sounds amazing to me so I would play if u think people kill because of violent video games then ur wrong because it's in they're fucked up mind meaning something was wrong with them before they played video games
20788,I want to ask all the americans here how you can cope with the news in your country. It looks very focused on opinions and all that.
20789,Pokemon witch craft? Are you fucking retarded die in a hole please stupid ignorant priest or whatever see this is why I'm Christian without the ignorance
20790,I'm gonna make a game so fucked up that ignorant parents will be talking about it and Ive already got come backs ready on those stupid asses that can't just leave people alone
20791,Sexy
20792,lol
20793,yo the biost news on here
20794,pokemon is not racist to black people that pokemon is based off a Japanese fashion
20795,Why do people blame video games for shootings? Their are people who have no life and play COD and BF everyday if video games cause shootings then there would be a mass shooting every frickin day. Also just because the based a game on a real life event is stupid because look at cod waw it's freakin based on a WORLD GOD DANG WAR JESUS!
20796,Anyone notice that foxnews was behind a lot of these
20797,"Gun laws don't save people. Proven Chicago. If people are going to murder then they will murder. In England, they have a non-point knife law because people are stabbing each other. People who say ""guns need to be banned"" probably do not have a gun or have much experience dealing with that side. Meaning they are afraid of something they know nothing about. Is that arrogance?
Think about it like this. If a man wants to kill you, then he will try. He breaks in and starts for the back bedroom with a knife in hand (assuming that guns are banned). Now you have limited options. Lock the door and wait for the cops which are only minutes away or take him on. Ether way not very good.
Now lets change it. Keep the same scenario and this time he has a gun and you do not. Should the man of justice be punished for the bad man's actions?
I don't mean to sound like an ass, but I am trying to bring light to people who don't understand. If you tell me you would be the guy that would be defenseless then go ahead, I might read about you in the news...."
20798,"All this to say...
Fox News needs to shut the f*** up. B\"
20799,Boy was this a good one! I wasn't aware of some of these controversy's. Others are painfully obvious. The torture mission in GTA and the No Russia missions were easily two of my most uncomfortable yet memorable moments in video games
20800,"Actually, Fallujah game censor was Bullshit. OF COURSE your damn kids had chance to not die at war, you morons, they could simply not go to the war. ""If you will walk in another man's country with a gun, you better get ready for some action, Jack!"""
20801,I hate it when they blame video games for shootings it's like just saying a guy just killed. 50 people whilst wearing air max obviously it's Nikes fault
20802,"Yes because the reason behind mass murders in AMERICA is video games and NOT THAT ANYONE CAN HAVE A GUN. Whenever people are afraid of something they say its the biggest disaster the world has ever seen. Just like how cinematography was conceived in the beginning of the 20th century. Also, is it a coincidence that these are covered by crap channels such as Fox News? Why do they have such a big influence? PLEASE, get a move on America. And apart from that media are attracted by mostly negative press for some reason. Did someone say that Mass Effect has one of the best scripts or options system. That CoD makes people have better reflexes? No. Years and maybe decades will take for the mass to accept it. Or the modern part of the population becomes the mass. 
Ain't that worth a like? :-)"
20803,"Does anyone actually value Fox News opinion? Even Rupert Murdock watches it with the sound off. Also, aren't their main audiance over the age of 60, to 70 and are mostly dieing off?!"
20804,Where is Resident Evil 5????/
20805,Games cant be the cause for things like that because games and guns dont kill others people do if idiots blame killings on things like guns and games they need to realize someone could use a gun to kill or they could use a knife it just depends on the killer not games
20806,"Notice all the ""news"" channels are Fox News."
20807,"The media is full of bullshit basically
Sure bash abt vid games when theres wars in other countries
Fuckin media"

20811,The media are a bunch of jerks
20812,i think you guys defiantly got No. 1 right. i had a bunch more typed out. but decided that it didnt belong in youtube comments.
20813,I think people who blame video games for everything wrong in society are just stupid
20814,I hate the people that blame everything bad on video games without even playing any
20815,"When media covers ""controversy"" in gaming, I honestly think that they didn't have anything better to do"
20816,And six days in fallugiah looked fun.
20817,face palm the news the fuck is wrong with them.
20818,"If videogames were the reason for mass shootings, I think everyone would be doing it"
20819,The kill the doctor part at the end of the last of us
20820,So video games cause people to kill then? Must be why I've seen so many 10 year old shooting up their schools after playing Call of Duty.
20821,I play first and third person shooters and it doesn't make me violent it's usually because the person is insane or super violent
20822,top 10 evil doppelgngers in video games
20823,All I got out of this is that people are SO ignorant. Seriously there is a lot of stupid beliefs about video games.
20824,Spec Ops The Line was so fucked it was surprising it wasn't banned everywhere.
20825,You sound like kyrsp33dy
20826,"When that lady said ""A bunch of guys sitting around laughing when they died"" I totally fucking get that her son died but fuck me games are supposed to be fun that what they are about."
20827,Pokemon? Really? (I did always wonder about the Jynx change...)
20828,wtf? why isnt no russian 1st???!
20829,"Games can teach you how to fight but its B.S to say that V.R guns will make somebody a killer, some lengths I agree with but with fox news and political nutjobs they sould stop getting to consent of the virtual world"
20830,"""Hm, mass shooting that killed tons of people.. Okay, let's use the information we know to help us find out the cause: The shooter had a mental issue (Check), the man gave threats to the area (Check), he was involved in many crimes before (Check), is a heavy drinker (Check), takes massive amounts of drugs (Check).. Hm...... Yup, must be the video game industry. Let's restrict violent video games from being made!""
I just summed up what politics (And the media) say when there's a shooting that had to do with a large amount of innocent people."
20831,Call of duty could never inspire anyone to kill a bunch of people...you know how many times I died!
20832,"Wow. I hadn't heard about some of these. Things that occur in video games usually don't bother me, but I must admit, that scene in 'Modern Warfare 2' was pretty awful."
20833,None of these were too bad to get on the new except for the no Russian nothing really raised a red flag for me
20834,I
20835,"Hey, heres a thought! Lets jst not give violent, suggestive video games to the mentally unstable. If someone can't handle violence without deciding to be violent themselves, then it's up the parents to not give them access to them!"
20836,8:41 she understands!
20837,If anything I think video games prevent violence as it gives people a way to let off steam without harming real people. I don't know how many times people pissed me off and I just go on a rampage on GTA or Saints Row and feel totally fine afterwards.
20838,The mw2 no Russian mission really helped you spark a hate for makarov. Call of duty does a good job of making you really hate the villains and motivate you to kill them. Missions like this are needed in a call of duty game.
20839,"You forgot the CoD:Back Ops controversy when you kill Fidel Castro's double, and point a gun at President Kennedy. THat should be in #2along with No Russian. Btw, No Russian was an optional mission, you could skip it, or even better, not shoot any civilians at all and watch the whole thing...
Anyway, if video game affect us, then why am I not a successful business-man rich enough to build my own mansion and have multiple wives, like I did in Sims 2? eh?Logic in society decays every time..."
20840,"At the end of the day its just a bunch of scared idiots who blame video games because they can not find something or someone to point the finger at to blame for it or some jerk who just uses it to exploit morons to get em to convert to some crazy shit I mean common Pokemon satanic? really? what next Crash bandicoot is the devil or Lara Croft is Cathulu in a female body because her boobs keep chaining shape?
What a load of crap at the end of it there just games and the people who push that BS are a bunch of fear mongering advantage taking assholes who have to much power and want more by exploiting sheep.
I know this seems a bit much but it gets me mad when jerks blame games for ""EVERYTHING"" that happens it's stupid and they know it."
20841,Video Games don't make violent people there are just violent people who play Video Games.
20842,Unfortunately parents are too lazy and irresponsible to take responsibility so they blame the electronic unpaid babysitter guess you should have kept it in your pants huh dumb ass.

THEY ARE MEANT TO TAKE LITERALLY!"

20846,Who doesn't like games with violence and mass murder??? And even if you play a game where you're allowed to kill people there are times you just wanna play by the rules and see what is like to... Buuuut most of the time you murder everyone you can becuase it's just better!
20847,"this was painful to look at, as im a fan of the first 2 games they mention."
20848,"fallout 3 deserves at least a mention, it was banned in Japan!"
20849,KIM
20850,I think it's more likely we will have a real life robo cop than have any game a agree with this
20851,Wanna know the game that pisses all of us off? When parents and news teams start acting like fucking assholes. Get ur heads out for the 70's fuck! this is 2014 people!!!Q!
20852,"If people say thay obscene material is why people act out in obscene ways, then imagine how many people would get in trouble for sexual harassment because of porn."
20853,"If people say thay obscene material is why people act out in obscene ways, then imagine how many people would get in trouble for sexual harassment because of porn."
20854,Maybe gun violence would be lowered if the gun fucking law was out.Like stop letting people buy the shit God damn it
20855,"Eurgh Mass Effect sex scenes were brilliant, best game ever"
20856,"GIVE THE RELIGIOUS/CONSERVATIVES MORE SALT FOR THEIR FRIES,PEOPLE LIKE THE ONES WHO CALLED POKEMON SATANIC ARE THE REASON WHY I WENT ATHEIST,COME ON CHRISTIANS I KNOW ALL OF YOU ARE NOT DUMB ASSES WHO RELY ON PASTORS WITH THE IQ OF A 10 YEAR OLD TO GIVE THEM ""IFORMATION FROM GOD"",LIKE WHAT THE HELL IS THAT SHET LOGIC 
Pastor:Hey guys I think pepper is the spice from the devil lets go get more salt"
20857,Maybe America and other countries should stop legally selling guns instead of blaming video games. Fuck those people.
20858,I agree with that one women at the end because that is a big factor and who would go buy a gun and start shooting people like an idiot
20859,I love how congress is more concerned with video games than ACTUAL gun controls.
20860,You know you're Australian when playing Fallout 3 feels the same as making illicit drugs.
20861,You can pick up Witcher 2 in any games store in Australia
20862,Who ever say that games are bad for you are f..ing retarded DO THEY PLAYED IT DID THEY SAY HEY LETS BLAME IT ON GAMES NOT LIFE!!!!!
20863,what's the game at 8:32?
20864,"okay wtf......that 6 days in fullujah game didnt deserve that feed back, a lot of people lost their children in WW2 and in vietnam and in afganistan but you dont see anyone caring about that. ITS JUST A GAME"
20865,It seems when the news or government want someone to blame they blame 'violent game's cuz they are about killing and shooting
20866,"Really? you blame school shootings on video games? What about the bullies, bad parents, or illnesses? No! a school gets shot up, let's blame fucking gta or mw2"
20867,"Really? you blame school shootings on video games? What about the bullies, bad parents, or illnesses? No! a school gets shot up, let's blame fucking gta or mw2"
20868,the rape game
20869,">kill citizens in Iraq
>good patriot
>make a game
>OUTRAGE!!!!"
20870,"see's 1 minute sex scene ""HOLY FUCK ITS TRUE I ONLY HAVE SEX FOR 1 MINUTE"" - every person who complained about it"
20871,Gta 5 pisses me off and i hate that its only the tiny thing in popular games that are apperently big and should be banned
20872,Gta 5 pisses me off with evryone just talking about it all the fucking time
20873,"that is complete bullshit that people blame videogames for all those people shootings in real life, it is not videogame fault that some retards who dont see difference between reality and games play those kinds of games, or parents fault that they let their 1-9 year old kids to play violent games (most kids this age still doesnt see difference between reality and games/dreams)"
20874,No Russian wasn't as easy as the press made it to be it was a reasonably difficult mission and you could skip it so FUCK YOU press!
20875,"i think as for the ""No Russian"" mission form mw2, the creators were trying to show you the view of a terrorist, and exploit why terrorist are bad and teaching the player why the terror is a bad concept."
20876,5:00 WOW. so all of the WW2 and WW1 based games where hundreds of thousands of people died are fine? but a smaller war with fewer deaths is not ok?
20877,do more controversy!
20878,All of them pissed me off
20879,"I love what that woman says at the end ""you can not just blame it on one video game or two video games."" It's nice to see that not all ""non-gamers"" jump to conclusions."
20880,"Honestly people who think that video games cause violence are ridiculous. After all, I don't see any of the ""adults"" on here jumping on turtles, or trying to fight aliens off in a spaceship. Come on people, if video games cause violence then I wonder what games were played during the crusades? Or the revolution? How about the civil war? Oh! Let's not forget the world wars! What video games were played then again?"
20881,These people that go against games are so stupid cause all games r the same even the Olympic chess hide and seek freeze tag even duck duck goose some one runs or hides also some pieces die and everyone wants to be ahead so does that mean cause we want to do it in a game its going to happen in real life yes with or without games also the people that complain about the army games and there kids dying at war they all new what they were signing up for and theres no way to stop them its what they wanted in there life so shame on them to say it was a game that shows there life when life is not a game and thats something they should have told there kids before they joined the army life is not a game there's no reset button like in mario or Atari witch ever year he joined so stop blaming games and blame the people that didnt tell them the difference
20882,lol pokemon black and blue looks awesome!
20883,Scare mongering. A gamepad in a priests hand that is never put down.
20884,I hated the satanic pokemon thing the did it was stupid
20885,just sitting here in the comments with my popcorn XD
20886,Stupid soccer moms ruining games for everyone just beacause of a few people
20887,"The problem with Six Days In Fallujah is it's too soon. There was no real controversy over the Medal of Honor games doing Pearl Harbor or D-Day. Though there was a small group that complained about Americas Army, for the most part no one had a problem with the Army using a video game as a recruiting tool. So it's ok to use video games to recruit people for war but not to show the other side, interesting.
Edit: Now that I'm done with the list I just want to point out that Carmageddon was an awesome game I spent a ton of time playing as a kid. It hasn't affected me at all, I don't run people over much, and I rarely hit other cars and most of them deserve it."
20888,anything involving wrestling always pisses me off
20889,u know in the mission no russian the game never gives an objective to kill the civilians. that whole part of the mission can be finished without shooting at all.
20890,"No lesser known titles are mention,ed of course.
Rule of Rose anyone?"
20891,"i have a question, since people think that if i play a fps i am a killer but if i play Saints row 4 should the mean im Friggin super powered president or a sparten in halo?"
20892,"Here another thing.. Banning and censoring games for what? There are so many researches that DISPROVE the statement that ""video games are the reason for killing frenzies and whatsoever"" oh yeah.. children are playing violent games.. and it is the fault of those dirty video game producers who are evil and worship the devil.. they just want to dirty our children.. yeah sure. Parents need an excuse to push THEIR fault onto those devilish games. Parents.. get real, it is only your fault, if you take your supervision real. Nearly no children would play such games like call of duty and some other games"
20893,"I don't understand why people are.. oh yeah they just need a story. I mean, they KNOW it is for ADULTS but they are banning or censoring games.. because it is violent? Haha, they should ban war because it is also violent, or they should just wipe the human race out BECAUSE THEY ARE FUCKING VIOLENT TOO.. we are a degenerated race.. nearly our whole history is about violence in every kind.. torture, murder, betrayal.. for what? For power, why is there war? Because we don't have the same opinion or ressources.. Why are they controversing about games that are for adults? They need to look at real things and let us gamers in peace religion is fine and everything but this fanatism is so much over the top i mean.. they are exaggerating so much.. this is laughable ""witchcraft"".. let's build a time maschin and throw them back to the middle ages so they can controverse about ""witchcraft"" and satan. So much logic in their minds like alice on a drug trip."
20894,whats more is that so much worse has been released in film and TV
20895,I Bet Australia is seriously boringwithout good games.
20896,"I like violence and murder in video games, cause where the hell else are psychopaths like me supposed to do it? I know this sounds cliche, but this is impeding our rights. We have the freedom to do whatever the hell we want, whenever the hell we want too. It's these Goddamn liberals who make video games the enemy and the root of all problems. They're not the fucking problem."
20897,"Hmm, how about this thought? THEY'RE FUCKING VIDEO GAMES."
20898,"So according to #1
It's the stimulation, not the gun for example (in this case a school shooting)
but if there's a drunk driver it's the driver not the beer?"
20899,#4 so we can make movies based of of wars but not with games. Makes total sense.
20900,1:55. People like that make me feel absolutely PUTRID. I have ZERO faith in humanity when people see nothing but satin in Pokemon.
20901,People have been doing mass killings way before games came out. To blame stuff like that on games is ludicrous. I want to get more into depth about this but whats the point
20902,"Yes video games do cause violence.....
Because.......
Adolf Hitler played GTA....
Jack the Ripper played Manhunt 2......
And hell even Judas played Saints Row.....
America has high gun crime ""because of video games"" yet here in the UK we have very small if any gun crime and the same video games....? 
Hmmmm........."
20903,that MW2 mission was awesome
20904,No Russian MW2
20905,"people blaming video games for mass shootings just annoys the fuck out of me. yes, people have killed each other because of video games, but I've got a little fact for you THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT ALL THERE. somebody has probably died over every single entertainment product ever made. every book, every comic book, every movie, every tv show and yes every video game. but not only does it come with the territory of making any entertainment products but it also responsible for about one in every hundred million murders or suicides. and like i said it happens with every single entertainment product so why do only video games get blamed?"
20906,"I wouldn't blame games for mass shootings but they've gotta blame something, right?"
20907,"5:07 A perfect example of the fat, ugly, soccer moms that ruin today's gaming."
20908,Oh God. I got chills watching the whole clip. Maybe it's the fact that i'm a gamer and i don't know that some games can be such a controversial topic.
20909,I hate the media so much
20910,"the governmentseems to forget that the holocaust, slavery, dictatorship,the crusades and the atom bomb where the biggest atrocities ever to happen to the human race, and guess what VIDEO GAMES HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT!!!"
20911,Meanwhile at fox news: well sais watch mojo
20912,l4d2 is not banned in australia any more
20913,3:27 what game is that?
20914,"notice that all of the stupid clips of news people being dumb is mostly fox news. that's pretty realistic, they are stupid most of the time."
20915,Sorry about too much ''fun'' in the part with gta.
20916,These type of people are adorable.
20917,"Damn communist, hippies, traitor, worthless anti-war commies!!!! Damn 6 Days in Fallujah looked sooo cool!!"
20918,"I've been playing Pokemon Christian Edition and my Charmander doesn't evolve.
How do I fix this?"
20919,"I'm pretty sure I have killed more than 100,000 living beings in video games but in real life I don't see any point or joy in killing."
20920,"These days, it seems like a lot of companies feed off or even encourage the controversy. And why wouldn't they? All press is good press and bound to make their game more popular with gamers, who love this sort of stuff. I mean, are you really going to tell me that ""No Russian"" needed to be included to propel the already paper-thin plot of MW2? That they couldn't have though up a less controversial way to get the ball rolling?
Please. Game companies do it on purpose."
20921,I really get mad when they blame games what about movies they are worst but they jump to games well it's not either one it's different and the only reason GTA is fun is cause you can do what you know you can't do in real life
20922,Wait If most of these games are 16/18 +why would it affect children's mental state of mind?
20923,Lol what about the Assari?
20924,Pffft Fuck Fox News. They'll put their spin on anything thing so as long as they get ratings
20925,I was pissed off on the gun controversy because they blame video games because they want to procrastinate talk about gun laws or how people with mental illnesses shouldn't be allowed to by weapons
20926,Apocalypse here come.
20927,The Fallujah game pissed me off so much. I wanted to see that.
20928,"Oh? I thought that Arma III imprisonment would be on the list, which caused a shit load of controversies on 2012."
20929,They all pissed me off. Fuckin liberals.
20930,"So... It can't be Totally impossible to get some of the forbidden games for those who live in Australia?
BTW, I'm so morally involved in my games that i didn't shoot any civilians in No Russian. :|"
20931,"People blaming video games for killings and other stuff are brainwashed tools that lack theproper brain function to analyse what they've seen, the same type of people that are too close minded to accept that games can be works of art as well..."
20932,What gta has that giant tank thing?
20933,"all i no is peta, the news, and the govt are just full of aholes who no nothing about games and are just love blaming things that are just so easy to blame! heck peta also kills animals, the news spreads fear and paranoia and hates anybody who speaks their rights, and the govt kills more then its fair share of people (so called ""democracy"" pretty much involves killing anyone that gets in their way and doesn't even care for the tons of innocent blood they spill every year!)."
20934,OH WOW SOME KIDS DID A REANACT OF THE PURGE PEOPLE DIED IN AND IT WAS IN I THINK CHICAGO
20935,"How about instead of banning video games,ban weapons,drugs,strippers,bullet proof vest and hookers too?That will solve your damn problem!IT WILL EVEN FUCKING SOLVE WARS!No need to blame video games.Blame yourself as a parents who LET YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER PLAY A FREAKING 18+ GAMES WITHOUT EVEN CHECKING IT FIRST!Blame yourself as a stupid reporter who blame videogames as threat .!
OMG WE NEED TO BAN MORTAL KOMBAT BECAUSE IT GONNA MAKE LITTLE JIMMY DECAPITATED PEOPLE HEAD WITH A FIST!
(Sarcasm)
Real life fact--->Some animals is more intelligent than humans.Example-Monkeys and Apes."
20936,"I'm surprised the whole ""Resident Evil 5 is racist"" card didn't come up. That was such a huge controversy that even the voice actors were openly interviewed trying to explain how the game is not racist.
Also I feel like politicians shouldn't be allowed to argue about video games. I can guarantee you 99% of them don't play video games, so who are they to go around and make false claims about something they know nothing about?"
20937,Fucking news teams always blaming music or video games
20938,"So in shorter detail, most of Fox News is just retarded"
20939,"Call of Duty is realistic???? Did that lady even watch 10 seconds of that game, much less play it? Remember the days when news networks actually did research into their stories?"
20940,"The fact that news network and ""authorities"" called out Mass Effect and Pokemon for ""slutty women"" and ""animal abuse"" goes to show that nothing that news networks and so called ""professionals"" can be taken seriously. I agree that some Mass Effect characters are, shall we say, overly sexual in their appearance and attitudes (im looking at you Miranda Lawson) but as for everything else, you dont immediatley have sex with one of your female crew members off of first sight. Having sex with a character requires you to talk with them, gain there trust, and develop a friendship with said character. On top of that, the ""sex scenes"" are less than a minute long and are huge cock blocks. In most of the romance scenes, you barely see the ladies skin. And lets not forget that you can also romance men. As for the pokemon thing, I have no words to express how stupid and mind numbing those allegations are. But hey, it makes for a good story right?"
20941,i wish people would get over themself its a game not real life id like to know how in the hell thay think i can use a real gun cause i move sticks on a controller
20942,"Let me tell you something, you stupid americans, mass killing sprees happen in the usa because you can walk to a store, BUY A FAKING GUN, and nobody will ask you why you need a gun, if you're a maniac, so get your freaking sh*t together, and start having rules againts this!!"
20943,San Andreas was the best GTA... Just saying :P
20944,This is why we have ratings ok u concerned mothers.  stop making a big fuss over a game ok
20945,"People need to pull their panties out of their pants, I mean Jesus it's a video game."
20946,"Really? Pokemon? Sigh. Gotta love mainstream media. ""It's something which possesses values for other people that I don't understand/don't agree with! BLAME IT FOR EVERY BAD THING THAT EVER HAPPENED!!"" I'm intentionally exaggerating here, but please, I'm not that far off."
20947,Fucking liberals always blaming it on something else other than the truth
20948,"I wish people would leave video games alone. Billions of people play these games. If ten or so people decided to go crazy that's not their fault. It's personal responsibility. You're fucked up kid decided to kill a bunch of people, maybe you should have raised them better. Movies and Games don't make serial killers, they just make them more creative -Billy Loomis from Scream. Whoever wrote that line said it all. Watching a bunch of Adam Sandler movies doesn't make me go out and act like a douche bag and video games don't make me a killer."
20949,"The fact that some mass killers play videos games if irrelevant. For one video games are extremely popular so they are likely to be playing them anyways, and two, they were going to kill someone anyways. Don't blame the victim and don't punish the innocent."
20950,In no Russian you don't even have to shoot then he never says to kill anyone and you could just walk with them
20951,I'd want to make a game and after an extremely controversial mission it cuts to the main character talking about how video games don't cause violence and how there's scientific proof backing it up...but I know the media won't listen and they'll probably just skip that part
20952,Fox news and anyone who blames games for violence can go fuck themselves for eternity.
20953,3:45 OMG thats Kim.
20954,Ban virtual guns but not real guns. This bollocks is what gets on my tits
20955,Fuck those fox news bastards those racist dicks can go fuck themselves they are a bunch of pussies who alienate anything they don't like I fucking hate them
20956,"Solution to the No Russian mission: don't shoot the civilians. Shoot the police, but don't shoot civilians."
20957,"So video games are to blame ey?
Its kinda funny considering I have never seen sombodey jumping from roof to roof (or attempting to) after playing mirrors edge . Never seen a guy punch a tree after playing minecraft. Never seen a guy trying to fly or use martial arts after playing any game like that. But here comes the fun part:
People learn about guns , killings ,wars and murder in school (nothing wrong with that) . When they choose to play a game focusing around like WW2 then its ""holy shit this kid could potentaily go on a killing spree"" . I get that manhunt and games liek that can fuck someone up but not that much. Basically something that has been around forever (violence if you dont get what i mean) is getting blamed to be a sideffect of video games when all along its about the human itself.Only people who has been treated ill or are mentaly disturbed go on say a school shooting to get revenge . So its a chain of events leading up to it (bullying and such) . And since we dont want to blame ourself we blame video games. Its a fucked up world we live in"
20958,"For Mw2 have you heard the saying ""some sacrifices must be made for the greater good?"" I mean let an airport die or let the world die"
20959,I just like how on four the reporter woman just makes a below the belt remark to make them to look like the bad guy even more really describes modern journalism
20960,Fox news can suck one.
20961,Its the peoples fault for not wanting to skip No Russian but playing and complaining about it.
20962,"That Australian law is actually a bullshit smokescreen to shut up lazy ignorant parents. What Parents - oh who are we kidding, Mums - don't realize is that you can still buys these games in Australia online without any restrictions.
They just want someone to blame for the kids' bad behavior. And as long as they THINK someone else is getting punished for their kids' behavior, they don't care."
20963,4:16 lololol look how he moves lol thats so stupid
20964,If that was true why are they stupid enough to piss us off if they think we're violent
20965,I find it funny that some people would say women in Mass Effect are used only for sex when some of them are the most independent strongest characters in the game with very emotional personal stories and issue. (never mind that there are gay romances for both males and females in the game)
20966,"Why do games get all the hate, what about freakin movies man, movies are actually realistic, graphics wise, and a lot of the popular ones have either gruesome murder or disturbing scenes in them as well."
20967,people blame gamers for pushing a button to kill a fake person but people don't care then a soilder actually presses a trigger and acutally ends someones life
20968,"if I was on the news during the mw2 controversy: me: ok im sorry but im gonna have to cut you off to say you should read more into the game before you talk about it, you are not a terrorist in the game, you are a undercover agent trying to get details on your enemy."
20969,Huh? I live in Australia and I can play State of Decay.
20970,"I think the saying ""Guns don't kill people. Bullets do,"" is appropriate for this situation"
20971,Fox News *facepalm
20972,This video destroyed my faith in humanity.... why do we HAVE to bitch about every little thing
20973,they say war games make people killers... tell me now Nazis were playing video games?
20974,You know people dont and or cant understand that its digital. Its where you put YOUR violence so you dont unleash it in real life
20975,"Make game about WW2 : k 
Make game about Iraq war: OMGWTF"
20976,A lot of people will think I'm a pussy bitch for this but in modern warfare 2 I didn't actually shoot any of the civilians in the airport level I figured that it was kind of fucked up but the rest of the game was great!
20977,Some adults can just be so stupid thinking that a pokemon game or a couple of digits on a screen is corruption wow they are idiots
20978,I was surprised the rape simulation games didn't get mentioned. Although I suppose random brutal thrill kills are more heinous.
20979,"Well saints row 4 has been allowed in Australia for ages now, maybe about a year or more. Before this Australian government where stupid."
20980,I think people should quit there bitchen about video games if your going to do that keep it to your self and if one company makes a game u don't like because it's grorey or has sex and bad stuff shut up and just don't let your kids  play it simple
20981,I would like to see what the media had to say if a guy goes on a killing spree and he doesn't play video games or watch movies :)
20982,"that MW2 mission, is by far the worst
like, WOW.
That kind of makes me want to throw up actually"
20983,The adults need to stop.Kids won't change. They should learn that.
20984,"so true blaming the game is like saying if i go play minecraft im going to go and dig up my neighbors yard and make a castle
thats just retarded number 1 is just plain and simple truly people being retarded"
20985,"5:24 is the best part, the guy stalling afterwards is so cringey lmao"
20986,"Really though, think about it, In Modern Warfare 2 on the terrorist level, you didn't have to pull the trigger, but you did...
But in all seriousness those people are overreacting, no kid that plays COD is gonna get a gun and go on mass shootings, those are just hypersensitive freaks having a fit over pixels."
20987,"All dat media Q_Q they should stop trying to point the finger at games and music and look in the god damn mirror, monsters are not born, they're created. So if your child has the mental capacity of a fucking empty glass of coke then don't give them GTA
(I do know there's no such thing as an empty glass of coke >.<)"
20988,I love how all the people complaining are from fox or are conservative
20989,"Why has it always been old people who say this ignorant stuff? No one wants to hear your mouth, because youare the ones who sound and looknegative. Let people do what they wanna do with their lives. Stop trying to get famous by bashing shit because your time is almost up in this world."
20990,"Where's Splatterhouse?
That being said I love how most of these show Fox. Those idiots are a joke. I grew up playing Mortal Kombat and Duke Nukem and most of my games are violent. I have yet to actually as much as punch someone in the face, much less shoot someone. Hell I've never actually shot a gun! I'm afraid of them in real life."
20991,"Not bragging, just telling you the facts, but, I am an A honor roll student that has pretty good manners (and pretty sane ;)) and all this bull about violent video games making teens more violent is pretty much the only thing that gets me angry. I play GTA 5  every other day among other similar games and it has no effect on how I act throughout the day. I just get a good laugh out of it and that is all. Seriously, can't we all just agree that all games have no effect on how we act or feel?"
20992,If they mad a movie about their kids who died they wouldn't bat an eye.
20993,"Bullshit... u make the decision not the fucking game... people r so fucking stupid its unreal... theres a rating on the game for a reason and if a parent were to buy a game for their child and then their child went out and killed someone its the parents stupid fucking fault for letting them play the damm thing... stuff like this really grinds my fucking gears i mean really, were video games made before war and guns? No... so the sooner people realize this the better fuckin idiots"
20994,"Games dont kill people,people kill people!!!"
20995,WHOA WOAH WOAH WHY DO PEOPLE THINK WHEN THEY SEE CALL OF DUTY OR OTHER GAMES WHEN YOU KILL PEOPLE THEY THINK THAT U CAN GO ALL AROUND SHOOTING PEOPLE LIKE A COMPLETE R_E_T_A_R_D_S?!?!
20996,"lets make a pure torture game with highly detailed gore and realistic disturbing reactions, oh and a raping sim c: take dat PTA and toss in a lil animal vivisections for PETA"
20997,This is some bullshit if people kill other people becuz they like shooter games don't you think everybody would be in prison and it said that the government blames virtual guns when real ones are used that's retarded just because some one plays a violent game that doesn't mean they'll just go and do a massive shooting.
20998,"The stupid media blaming video games... ironicly almost all of these controversies are in USA. Oh, what about banning guns? Maybe that will stop gun murders and massacres by more than half, no?"
20999,"Can't help but feel most of these controversies come from people either stirring up controversy AKA Fox News, truly misunderstanding the concept of promoting realism in a game, or both. I'd love to see a realistic game depicting war. I swear, whenever I play something like Starcraft I think about how senseless the conflict itself is and how it could be prevented. Maybe instead of criticizing games for depicting the realism of war we could criticize the people who not only glorify but promote it. Just a thought, not trying to start controversy myself here.
Edit: If you have a problem with the Starcraft reference, it mostly has to do with sending marines or worker scouts to their doom for the benefit of the whole. I just think there needs to be another solution and when there isn't there is a degree of realism that needs to be addressed. I think that if the Fallujah game was released then of course you'd have dickheads laughing about it but a lot of people would actually take it for what it is and how it depicts what war is as opposed to something like Call of Duty in which... y'know what, i'm done. Flame me if you want. I think I've said all I can say."
21000,"Pokemon, pokemon! With the poke and the mon!"
21001,So they didn't care about wolfenstein? Wtf!?
21002,"Just because I play mario kart I'm not a race car driver, just because I play rock band that doesn't make me a rock star. So why would gta make me a killer?"
21003,what you said about Australia was a bit off.
21004,"Number 1 REALLY pisses me off. I hate it how the press decides to blame video games for no FUCKING reason. It is just because they don't like it and they want a story. A story about a boy killing his classmate is not so weird. He just had something weird in the head. But when you say a boy killed his classmate because he was influenced by Call Of Duty, it sounds much more interesting. Also, if people actually decided that game like this are bad, what about the TV the news reporters are going to watch, or the movies? NCIS, that is about killing and other types of offensive things, but do they point fingers at that? NO. Because they like them. They only blame games such as Battlefield, CoD, Planetside 2... etc because tey don't find interest in them. On top of that, looking at a video game doesn't tell you everything about guns. If you gave a person who played CoD or Battlefield a gun, they would have no idea to to turn the safety off, chamber it, or even most likely, reload it. So, pretty much, the news is just about seeing who they can manipulate into thinking their truth is the right truth."
21005,Fucking Fox News...
21006,Newest comment within a week right here!
21007,M  J
21008,God it's not the games fault it's the idiot says hey lets become murders and bank robbers of terrorists
21009,Why doesnt america focus on gun control instead?
21010,"what... the... fuck... how, in anyway possible, is pokemon, quote: graphic"
21011,Company of heroes 2 controversy which considered the USSR to be......you know.....
21012,People are savages when they play violent video games and the creators should think about what they should do
21013,Look I'm 11 I play MA-17 games and I can't believe people do this over games maybe people should keep their cool and dont mimic video games
21014,Lets ban everything. Everything is offensive to someone.
21015,pokemon is teaching witchcraft? lol i ddnt even know that
21016,I live in Australia and classification sucks
21017,"Arrest meh, yer smartasses. I kill innocent people by jumping on their head like in the most brutal game that ever was - Mariooooo"
21018,"If the right wing would adhere to their principals they would be in favour of video games since they are protected under the constitution and that is what conservatives claim to be their most cherished document besides the bible ( when it suits them). The only reason they hate on video games so often is because the NRA needs a scapegoat and a distraction after mass shootings, so everytime they bring up videogames and how dangerous they are when it has been proven that they are not."
21019,"I really hate that they ban games in Australia, its a real slap in the face for gamers here"
21020,why wasnt splatter house included? i heard number 2 was cancelled
21021,"I find it beautiful the people's reactions to Video games. ""They are TOO violent"" they say. ""They make them do in real life what they do in games"". They do think we are mentaly challanged, don't they?
But some attempts are priceless when they make games or videos to try and stop a game from being made, but right after, the community turns that into a parody and makes the video, or game, much worse xD"
21022,"Blame the Video games for the parent's irresponsability.
Game is violent, parent allows child to get it. Child murders someone, Game is to blame.
As a gamer, i have played various violent games and non violent games and only once in my life i got into a fight. Never a gun shot, never anything of dangerous. A parent needs to know how the mentality of the kid works to know which games he can play without any issues. I am 18 atm and until so far, my parents know what kind of games i play, and they allow me to play them because they know i've always had a mature mentality and could say what was good in real, and fun in virtual. Without mixing both."
21023,"imo games do NOT cause violence because if you're like ""hey i'm playing COD and now ima go buy a gun and shoot some dudes irl and then think it's COD"" then your brain was probably totally messed up in the first place. the game wasn't the cause."
21024,"All of these pissed me off because Fuck the industry. These games are created for FUN. Nothing more, nothing less."
21025,Every thing
21026,"People need to chill, it's just a game. You know these anti-gamers have gone too far when they talk about the games more than we do."
21027,Saints row 4 is leagal in Australia
21028,in fact all of them are stupid in there own rights
21029,every controversies over pokemon were so stupid
21030,it is always fox news always
21031,were starcraft got blamed
21032,"Probably one of the most absurd things I have ever heard was that they were rape scenes in GTA. Now I have played GTA San Andreas, GTA Vice City Stories, GTA Liberty City Stories, GTA 4, GTA The Lost and Damned (which is part of GTA 4) GTA 5 and they were none rape scenes in those games whatsoever. I mean if there was, GTA would not be as popular as it is now."
21033,se'xbox' :D that was good
21034,Im surprised that payday 2 didn't any controversy. Heck the payday series. Not saying payday isn't good I freaking love payday 2
21035,"Good way to respond to a controversy Kevin.
You did a fucking good job"
21036,What do conservatives have against video games? Fucking 50+ year old pricks.
21037,"Americans are idiots....Instead of blaming the total lack of gun control laws in America, they blame video games. Yea, that's logical lol"
21038,I like how it was just Fox News coverage.
21039,"6 Days In Fallujah shouldn't have been scrapped. It seems like it was made as a tribute to the soldiers that fought in the war, instead of something like Call of Duty where you just kill for fun. I'm not hating on COD, just making a comparison."
21040,FFFOOXXX NNEEEEEEEWEWWWWWSSSSS!!!!!!
21041,5:28 dumb ignorant bitch doesn't even know what the game was
21042,"Video games cause violence in real life?
Please tell me what video games people were playing during both world wars :)"
21043,"Fox News - lmfao, what a bunch of crackpot cunts."
21044,"Im pissed off that Six Days in Fallujah never came to be released :/
Im fully aware that video game life =/= real world life...."
21045,"Screw those ""games cause violence"" people, the only reason I can even go to school or function at all in life is 'cause I get my aggresion out through games."
21046,Everybody stop what you're doing and go play Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Wait till you meet Eliza and you'll understand TV
21047,"how is six days in faluja any worse then call of duty games such as world at war, people lost lives there to but it wasnt taken of the market and banned"
21048,I lost it at the reference to jack Thompson
21049,"So according to News Casters and The US Congress,
I should have Post Dramatic Stress Disorder from playing over 1000 hours in Battlefield 3 :P"
21050,Almost every allegation is bullshit. Leading to the fact that when Picked up GTA 5 last year (I'm 19) my parents felt the need to advise me that it's just a game and not to do anything stupid. So I turned it on them. A week later I ran into their house saying I'd ran someone over because it looked fun in gta. THEY LOST THEIR SHIT!!!!  And started questioning! They sat me down that's when I said it's just a game. Nobody died I'm not fucking stupid!
21051,Half this list is totally fine IMO
21052,What about the historical conspiracies that assassin's creed series shows?
21053,"The people who shoot others because of a GAME are MENTALLY ILL. A sane person wouldn't do that. I bet all of the people. Who did these things where insane. But when this happens the media doesn't ask ""Was he sane?"", they ask ""Did he play Call of Duty?"""
21054,The media is controlled. They love to change the truth to better suit their need to cause controversy and to get support. It pisses me off.
21055,The media is controlled. They love to change the truth to better suit their need to cause controversy and to get support. It pisses me off.
21056,"Video game are based on what humanity is really violence and a lots of hypocrisy. Look how Americain media make people think that video game is the fuel of violent peoples, when the United State is full of racism, injustice, disinformation and an incompetent state. Those facts make me way more violent than the video game. I'm sorry but, supporting the Israel state, in its rampage against all humans rights create one million time more terrorist than video game will ever do. PS:Parents if you buy Gta 5 for your 8 years old kid, don't blame the game, blame yourself and stop reproducing."
21057,"I would like to mention the Tera Online Elin censorship,  if you don't know then look it up"
21058,I don't blame the media for freaking out about no Russian.
21059,I can understand that its on the families who lost members in Iraq but seriously call of duty practically made Fallujah in cod4 but no one gave a shit
21060,"Mental Illnes is a big problem, sure but that doesnt mean they have to FUCK UP VIDEOGAMES, heck same applay to Movies, tv, anime, cartoons, news, etc etc. These people should shut up.
Also it mostly happend IN NORT AMERICA."
21061,Come onwho really takes Fox News seriously ?
21062,"I really can't understand all those people who say that the ""No Russian"" mission was controversial. 1. When you first play the game it warns you about offensive content and allows you to skip it. 2. You can skip the mission any time by simply pressing ""Esc""!!! 3. You don't have to shoot at the civilians at all, just wait until it's over, this will save ammo for the later parts of the mission."
21063,That MW2 Leave no Russian mission still makes me sick to my stomach... Ughh It was hard for me to just see a group of civilians and just unload on them...
21064,"I find violent games a good way to get rid of all my anger, it helps! I'm twelve though so I'm not able to play that many games like that."
21065,"i find it funny(not really) how the media says video games cause people to rape,murder, abuse, do drugs and all other sort horrendous crimes yet people that are victims of these crimes or had rough upbringings more often then not become functioning members of society, but yeah its way more likely when you have a controller in your hand and you can see it on screen then actually experiencing it first hand. Seems legit"
21066,"Real guns are to blame for real gun violence.
Say what you want, but lack of gun control is why the U.S. government has lost control of these mass shootings."
21067,"People think that these violent video games are whats causing these mass shootings and such.
I'm the complete opposite. I think having these games helps prevent people from doing crazy shit. Its like an outlet for disturbing imaginations lol."
21068,"Video games don't make killers, judgmental news broadcasters and relatives do."
21069,why the hell does everyone hate on pokemon
21070,o keep crying fix news nothing is ever ok in your eyes
21071,I wonder if Bomber Man is to blame for the suicide bombers in the middle east.
21072,fuck fox news
21073,"gta san andreas has not have sex scenes and you cannot do it without a mod gta san andreas ,,sex,, is named ,,hot coffee mod,, without this mod you cannot do it"
21074,"our government and media cant except the fact that people are that fucked up in the head, games are their easiest scapegoat, i researched some things and experts say that being a psychopath and killing a lot of people, stem from psychological problems they had since birth, parents, take responsibility in your kids actions, i'm 24, seeing kids playing battlefield or cod that are like 5-6 years old,like wtf do parents think, its 18+ for a reason, its not games its the way kids are brought up, they'd rather schools teach them right from wrong instead of them, it's sad, our society is becoming lazier and lazier"
21075,When ever there is a school shooting they news always makes up the biggest BS stories about the kids playing FPS games that has been proven to have little to no effects and it docent even make any sense.
21076,These are just games. Everyone has to relax and chill. If you want to play the games then play the games. The americans have too many guns make guns illegal then everyone will be a lot safer.
21077,What about that game that was based on the Columbine shootings...
21078,In the german version of Mw2 you can't even shoot at the civilists :DD
21079,"In the words of someone who I can't think of at the moment, (I think it was Yahtzee of ""ZeroPunctuation"" ) ""Who would you rather attack? A guy with a warehouse full of AK-47s or some fat guys making video games?"""
21080,"It's funny how most republicans and conservatives think the 2nd amendment is their holy rule with bearing arms, weapons, guns and stuff... Yet they think it's bad for video games to have guns and weapons... But oh well. Video Games > Life ANYDAY Kappa Fuck Fox News! :) <3"
21081,geez it's just a game.
21082,I get angry hearing this bullshit. I'm a teen gamer play every game on the controversy list and I ain't stabbing people or whacking them with giant dildoes so Its difficult to see what these wankers are trying to achieve. It is either attention to be a so called 'hero' or they are just assholes. I bet most of these people (the young ones) probably played 1980 games in their parents basement probably masterbating and never being able to have intercourse with anyone. In actual fact it is probably why they are blaming a pixelated deagle for a real deagle.
21083,People murdered and raped long before explicit video games were released. Good video WatchMojo
21084,So before video games what was the reason for mass shootings?
21085,"Im sorry but six days in fallujah looks both graphically and story wise like a kick ass game, and its based off of stories of ACTUAL veterans, people who saw their friends and brothers in arms DIE beside them, it tells a fucking true story about those who have their lives and yet people get all upset and butthurt about it, like what the hell? So your son died.. And you DON'T want people to remember what he died for? Just, the ignorance!"
21086,"I play halo a lot and really its not that violent when will they ever get it and its not just halo,but when I see people that I know who are like in year 4 playing gta5 its wrong but it's not the games fault its the perants fault.Also I fell sorry for USA and Australia for having banned games"
21087,"Anybody who gets influenced by a video game lacks common sense. I don't know about everybody else but I always thought people played video games so you can do things you never could do in real life. Example: Play like a pro athlete, experience war without having to actually enlist, have cool looking shoot outs like in the movie, etc."
21088,Those people who try to make video games a problem are just bored and need any cause to make themselves seem important
21089,Why the hell do people still have any beleif for fox news? And why is no one even mentioning the fact of their mental history
21090,FUCK THIS THIS IS FUCKING STUPID EVEN IF I SKIPED THAT ONE MISSION IN MW2!!!!!!!!
21091,Who the Hell bitches about Pokmon I mean really santanic worshipping get the fuck out here I understand the problem with jynx but where the animal abuse somebody show me whether it's on Tv (I should note I stop watching the show when brock left) or on the video games
21092,"well, Ive been playing video games since i was 9 or 10, pretty much all of which feature at least some form of violence, and i have no desire to hurt anyone"
21093,i play lots of animal game so... i not crazy to try to bite my cat on a neck acting like a wild dog
21094,Micheal Atkinson is a c**t there are so many games that would be awesome if it weren't for him
21095,be realistic people if someone want to kill some men he dont need pc or console game for it it is mostly in his nature and you can blame game industry but it will do you no good
21096,I think the Mortal Kombat one pissed me off cause if u cant read the title y do u even bother buying it. Look at a game before u buy it cuz u don't know wat u can get into and in this case fatalities are one. Also the game is supposed to bloody too that's y its a fighting game. Dumbass Anti video game people they piss me off
21097,Video games don't caused the deaths it is the people who believe that they are fighting for their rights that is my opinion because I may be Irish but it doesn't mean I will go completely insane
21098,You americans are crazy...
21099,"the six days in fallujah controversy just pissed me off so much.
1. world war 1 and world war 2 were massive events/battles, much, much bigger then fallujah, yet there are hundreds of games of that without spawning anywhere near as much controversy.
2. you think just because your son died in the battle means that they can't make the game is incredibly selfish. my grandfather and many other peoples grandfathers died in the second world war, yet you don't here all of us complaining about it. you don't see millions of people complaining about games such as the early call of duty franchise, or the earlier medal of honour franchise, both based on world war 1/2. a few hundred people die in fallujah, where as millions of people died in ww1/ww2. just because your son died, doesn't mean the game should be taken off."
21100,"In response to 4:59:
If some guy laughs when he dies or when he kills someone while playing, thats his problem. The game didnt do that to him; its not the developerss fault. Hes just an inherently sick person, and theres nothing anyone can do about that. (As a side note, I dont know anyone who would laugh at that kind of thing. Its a true story, so I would give anyone who laughed at that a weird look.)"
21101,Liked for adoption joke.
21102,What about the Columbine Game?
21103,"Australians...
Not allowing the release of a game because it contains an anal probe, but gladly paying somebody else's GF to have a fuck.
Way to go kangas!"
21104,"These games don't cause people to go out and shot other people. The persons personal problem or other factors are to cause. The most a video game will do in helping with that is to help more flawlessly execute the act itself, and if that was the case that person playing the game wrong. The games are for Entertainment not studying murder methods."
21105,"Like all these stupid politicians complain about the blood and violence in these games, but can go watch people get mangled, tortured and killed in some cruel horrible way in Saw or Hostile. Which also is sooooo much more ""realistic"" or could happen then ANY violence in a video game. Told my friend we as humans just have messed up ways of entertaining ourselves. Think these movies and shows are way worse imo. So I rather play MK than watch Saw. Can't stand movies like that."
21106,God these reporters make my blood boil.
21107,"If anything is going to enrage an adolescent to go on a murder spree, it's a bunch of fucking retarded congresspeople/parents getting his favorite video games banned."
21108,"Ok, I am 23 years old, i've been playing GTA and COD all my life, video games DO NOT CAUSE VIOLENCE! The acts of violence that happen, are just acts of violence, the people are commit the crimes are to blame, not the games. People aren't that stupid...well apparently they are i guess,"
21109,This video was well put together. Also the speaker's voice sounds really close to HotDiggedyDemon's lol
21110,"Six days in Fallujah looked like a great game except on the fricken news interview they reporter said ""Many people lost their lives,children,and family members in that war"" the game developer said ""Well the game wasn't intended to be like th-""cut off by news reporter. I WAS SO FRICKEN ENRAGED!!!!!"
21111,I like how most of the news channels the show in this video are fox.
21112,WOW some of these controversies are retarded
21113,video games do not make ppl shoot up schools and shit ppl need to start taking responsibility for their actions
21114,The one that pisses me off the most is the satanic Pokemon rumor. I have never played a Pokemon game and I'm 15 all because of my religious family and that damn media source saying it was horrible. My first game was MK4 for crying out loud and I was 2.
21115,is it just me or is that guy saying something? 5:26
21116,"I play Battlefield, I'm ranking up on the ladder of my country armed forces, so I can steal a tank, and destroy a couple of vehicles while I think everyone else is Chinese/Russian/American.
I also play CoD, so I'm just waiting for September for my Airports to get filled with people, can't wait to recreate 'No Russian'.
Oh, did I mentioned I played Need For Speed for years? I'm amazed how I still have my Drivers License, should have been revoked by now for speeding and drifting around.
Oh of course I do play GTA, I go out sometimes with my Desert Eagle and shoot randomly at people, such laugh, then I come home and the cops immidiately stop looking for me, amazing, only reason I?m still here typing this.
That tim I played Resident Evil, some nights I turn into a Zombie and bite off people.
Look you media-faggots, IT'S not a game that makes you do bad shit. IT'S bad parenting, so tell those parents instead of blaming games, to blame their shit parenting, and go re-educate themselves in parenting, instead of blaming games. Thank you and fuck off."
21117,I have to agree with the no Russian mission on cod that clip you showed was horrible
21118,"Video games don't kill people, autistic loners with their parents' guns kill people"
21119,"Video games don't kill people, autistic loners with their parents' guns kill people"
21120,Wow. idiots. (The news)
21121,stupid fucking assholes blameing shit on videogames
21122,"I can't be the only one who tried playing first person shooting games and found it much easier to aim a rocket launcher and launch 3 rockets in under a minute than it was to fire 2 rounds with a handgun in over 5 minutes. There, I admitted I'm a bad shot. There goes any pride I don't have."
21123,What the fuck was the first game
21124,"what about assassin's creed? i mean yeah it teaches history better than Wikipedia but what about the stylish kills, blood, and organizations that may or may not be real"
21125,also in no russian you dont have to shoot
21126,Shit like this is what proves Americans are the stupidest people in the world not including terrorists
21127,"HOLY SHIT, i'm starting to lose faith in humanity. Video games being the cause of mass shootings? i remember this being an issue back when vice city came out. These news stations must be genuinely stupid. Mass shootings were caused by people who were already unstable, mentally ill and neglected/abused by their parents, not a digital video game. There's a very obvious line between reality and video games."
21128,Let's stop censoring games and play them for what they're supposed to be.
21129,I don't get y people blame video games for shootings. 90% of shootings the suspect is mental
21130,they are just video games. they are for entertainment. you don't see a real person try to risk their life to fly like a video game character. it's just a game
21131,Ok pepol blame vidogames wen the pepol now its something difrent
21132,3:40 I think that is yogscast kim
21133,"Now, I'm not one to say that video games cause violence or that they should be censored to the point of insanity but I still have nightmares over the ""No Russian"" level."
21134,Some people need to realize that they are just games and that they are fake. Not saying that people wont be influenced negatively by games but that still doesn't change the fact that they are only games.
21135,STOP BLAMING VIDEO GAMES FOR EVERY SHOOTING OR MURDER. MAYBE ONE OR 2 KILLINGS OR RELATED TO VIDEO GAMES BUT NOT EVERY SINGLE ONE.
21136,"god, no Russian give me the chills every fucking time"
21137,"Uhhh people lost there lives in WW1 and WW2, none seemed to mind playing games that simulate the major battles from then...... Fucking Fox news, feed the chickens feed the chickens."
21138,"If video games do cause violence, someone link me to the game that we've been playing for the past 5000 years."

21142,I'm going to try to become a SAR Tech that shit is crazy awesome. In case you don't know a SAR means Search and Rescue. I would be saving lives.
21143,"I kinda get that Call Of Duty massacre one. I get that it's part of the plot, but it's pretty fucked up."
21144,"To me it just seems like the media just wants something to bitch at for these killings or other things. Games where created for entertainment and will be entertainment, if parents don't like them then they should do their job and supervise what you buy them."
21145,watching this makes me laugh at the idiocy of America XD
21146,Why is the press so retarded -_- mw3 has a scene where a child dies in a chemical bombing. Didn't see the news cover that! So just because macorov outwitted the TSA they get their panties in a bunch? God the press is borderline retarded

21152,HOLY SHIT. COULD YOU IMAGINE IF THEY MAKE A GAME BASED ON SCHOOL SHOOTINGS?!
21153,i lol'ed when the pastor said pokemon taught kids witchcraft and enters us into the world of demonics

21158,"i also HATE how people think that games like GTA, Saints Row, COD, Battlefield etc. influence children. I'm 12 and I play all of those games and i am TOTALLY normal. If a kid really wanted the game, the wouldn't abuse it and start copying the stuff from the game. I think games shouldn't be 17+ because after ur 17 most people don't have time to play video games. They should be worried about getting a job, girlfriend, money, college, a life etc. ESRB should make FPS (first person shooters not frames per second) games 14+ and games like GTA stay the same"
21159,I'm going to murder everyone in my school with the power of my voice because I have 600 hours on Skyrim.
21160,I hate the media because of this. Oh my god.

21163,"I think you glossed over Custer's Revenge. The graphics are primitive by today's standards, but it is a game that seems to be about rape. If you're going to mention something, why not go in depth about it. Instead of having us ""lol"" at Atari graphics."

21175,It's a fucking video game! Not real life people need to get the fuck over it. If you don't like games don't ruin it for the people that do.
21176,why is all the griping media only fox news?
21177,I dont understand. How can you call doom a satanic game when your main objective is to KILL OTHER DEMONS AND DESTROY HELL!!!??
21178,"Then, all the terrorist played COD?"
21179,People cannot seem to fuckin understand that video games are just movies that you can control and be a part of. After playing GTA 5 you dont hear stories about youtubers going on rampages. That side of the media needs to get a fuckin life
21180,"Old people dont like video games because when they where a kid, every one was happy and had pet dinosaurs. So thier lives wasnt as cool as ours.  -_-"
21181,Ahhhhh shut up shut up shut up
21182,what is the name of the black and white game that appears to the end of the clip?
21183,EVERYONE CAN SAY WHAT THE PLAYER IN GTA DOES BUT HAS ANYONE RAMPAGED LIKE TREVOR PHILIPS RECENTLY?
21184,"Now, why the hell is Pokemon a controversial game anyways. I don't understand the Saitanic deal at all, unless if its dealing with pokemon that steal souls like the Litwick evolutions, then yeah I understand but seriously? The PETA deal I do understand about the animal violence and cruelty and such. But, think about it, in my eyes it's just a game where you train these fluffy and badass looking creatures to become the best. But it's also about a companionship on how animals and humans can come together and help one another. In battles they don't get hurt at all, do they? Do you see blood, do you see a pikachu with battle scars? Actually never mind on that I have nothing to defend pokemon battles. But racism in pokemon, are you serious, it's just ONE pokemon called Jynx. There is proof to back up that Nintendo and Gamefreak didn't mean to be racist at all (dont know it myself but #GameTheory)."
21185,Gta 5 controversy I couldn't get it because of that
21186,"I don't think people should ban video games! It seems way to extreme! If a game is too violent or racy to be M-rated, just make it AO! Why do you think they made that rating?? It's completely uncensored! I don't think they should have to go to extreme and ban games that people spent so much time in making! Just raise the rating! If someone lets himself play an AO game, they have to realize it may be offensive! So if you're offended by a game, just don't play it!"
21187,Why cant dem stupod floppers tell that a game is made for fun its staopid! They need to learn that they are played for fun and not for copying -.-
21188,"Being a Christian Pokemon player, all those theories of it being satanic really bothered me. I remember when I was little when I would visit my grandmother she was always telling me about how it was satanic and how it was really called pocket ""monsters"" She finally left me alone about it when i actually explained it to her but their is so many stupid people out there. The whole theory that it promotes animal abuse we just laugh about that now"
21189,"correction to that one gentleman: In Pokmon you don't cast spell, you catch them by throwing poke balls, second part There is NO witchraft it's just a move called Haut/cast/curse ETC, PLAY BEFORE YOU SAY!"
21190,Game at 8:29?
21191,this video just goes to show how gay our media and governments can be sometimes
21192,"The controversy over the MW2 mission makes me sick. It is a VIDEO GAME. Do people not understand that video games do not have to bridge with real life? It's just like when people won't kill an attack dog in Ghosts because it's ""horrible for the animal."" 1. It's a video game (aka not real life) and  2. You are playing a game where all you do is shoot PEOPLE. The world we all live in has become so ignorant and flat out horrible."
21193,"This probably sounds really weird, but I think that violent video games can cause kids to be less violent. Well I think if someone is a very angry or violent person, then violent video games can help. For example the could get all of their rage out by maybe shooting or acting violent towards someone in a video game instead of actually going and doing that stuff in real life. It just seems like it could be a good way to handle rage and violence."
21194,pokemon is satanic quote of the day lol
21195,The reason that these were controversies is fucking total bullshit.
21196,What's the black and white game there at the end? Looked interesting :)
21197,"Notice that many of these games are big hits? These soccer moms don't realize that making a game controversial makes people want to play it. It's called ""the Streisand effect"".
Honestly, the best way to get people to watch a movie you've made is to get guys like Fox News to say it's bad because of the sex and violence. Watch the profits go through the roof."
21198,"I'm sorry just... how are these... what the hell is wrong with these people? They can't forge an opinion on something they haven't researched. They see one event and go ""Oh that guy killed 3 people and played a computer game! Clearly, the computer game made him have these thoughts.' This is not directed towards WatchMojo.com"
21199,if we play games that we kill people in and beacome a killer like in the games why dont we playsurgeon simulator and beacomesurgeons
21200,i live in quensland and i play state of decay all the time
21201,3:14 In germany its even worse.
21202,I'll never forget that damn Pokemon controversy
21203,"definitely not suprised to see mw2's fucking ""no russian"" mission that scarred the cod franchise"
21204,The part I enjoyed was when the lady spoke the truth
21205,Here's what I think. Video games themselves do not make people do stupid shit like reenact gta. There has to be something wrong with that person. They had to be mentally unstable in the first place. Video games would just be some motivation. There have been more people who have reenacted violence from books in the past 20 years than people with video games in that same amount of time.
21206,The comments about Australia sucking make me VERY offended. I'm an Australian.
21207,People just like to play the blame game. I've played violent video games all my life and I couldn't hurt a fly.
21208,Wait I cant get SR4?
21209,"The mom who's son died during war has a point but come one. Nobody would have sat down and personally said ""lol...(dead soldiers name) died...haha..lets start over... While sad that he died he made the choice to make a career in a field where you can die. That's like saying I don't want a surgery simulator because my son has to see blood all day."
21210,"I can understand the MW2 mission, but pokemon?"
21211,"The two things that made the list were sex and violence. Because, you know, a biological process that almost every human ever will experience is just as bad as blowing up random people and eviscerating Kung-fu fighters."
21212,How amusing.
21213,"I think it's stupid that all these games were banned, TONS of games are about killing people and THEY don't get banned. It's just fun, if someone shoots a guy in real life they're going to prison, right? That's not the case in a game, it's just made to stimulate the brain and be entertaining. Also does anyone else here know how many hours must have been put into creating those games, just to have them banned? I mean, it just seems unfair to me"
21214,I just watch this to piss myself off lol
21215,"If video games change the way kids act, then why don't we see little italian plumbers calling themselves Mario running around?"
21216,I love how almost all of these are from Fox
21217,Hate all mass shooting blame games. They have to find out that the killer has played a shooter game at least once in their life and it's video games fault .
21218,violent video games are preventing people to kill cuz they can do it in a game. simple
21219,"After an interesting and informative video, the #1 spot was a total cop-out waste of time."
21220,"Most of the opinions from news outlets/congress from this list really pissed me off. I believe if you are of age, then there shouldn't be any censorship what so ever, why should the government be able to tell a responsible adult what he can expose himself to."
21221,Saints Row IV and State of Decay are both sold here as R18+
21222,"I live in Australia and all 3 of those games are not banded here. Mortal Kombat is R18+, Left 4 Dead is MA15+ and The Witcher 2 is MA15+"
21223,Makes me angry to know I cant make the best killing game yet because of dumb conservative idiot christians.
21224,I only have 3 words... Half... Life... 3...
21225,I hate idiots that blame games because they can't think of another excuse
21226,The gov tries to censor games while the murder millions of innocent people around the world and poison us and lie yet VIDEO GAMES = pure evil. Another example of NWO bullshit
21227,Australia = socialist shit hole
21228,"People die all the time, that's a horrible reason to cancel a WAR GAME."
21229,"Wait, what was the last, most controversial game?"
21230,"Just a heads up, it's not always conservatives"" who blame video games and other forms of entertainment for mass shootings. Both sides of the political spectrum do it. 
Good list though. :-)"
21231,Well the media will do anything to get a story stuff like Pokemon is satanic and promotes animal abuse just go away and let us enjoy out games
21232,"i am tired of all video game controversies!
I cant stand how other people make an effort to make everybody feel bad just because they may like a type of game!
I play extremely violent video games, and that somehow makes me a terrorist?
I play games that might have pointless killing (GTA) but just play it because it is free roaming and that makes people believe I only like to kill people!
Here's some news: people who play games like GTA, COD, Battlefield, Mortal Kombat etc. are rarely people who want to kill classmates or random people in real life"
21233,NEW CASTERS ARE ARSES
21234,plz do most boring and amazing video games
21235,"My thing with Six Days In Fallujah is that there are so many other wars depicted such in games like Battlefield, Call of Duty, Medal of Honor and so on and so fourth... Is it because it was more recent than those actual wars??? I mean WWI and WWII come up in almost every war game that is out there. I just think people want something to talk about because they get bored and start these stupid controversies."
21236,"My son died in war and that's why she doesn't like Six Days Of Fallejuh because people can ""restart and laugh over the death"" but in real life they can't. I'm sorry, but that's the same as saying ""my son died in a car crash, it's not fair people can die and respawn in GTA from car crashes"""
21237,Number 1 is bullcrap
21238,"Having just watched the Mortal Kombat X footage from E3 2014 and then seeing all of the controversy about the ""brutal violence"" in the original Mortal Kombat, this made me LOL..., hard.
My how times have changed...."
21239,damn guys whats about counter-strike =D
21240,Does anyone know how to get manhunt 2
21241,"Lol, fucking old people blaming video games. What about shootings that happened before video games? Also all those shooters are psychos. Maybe you should stop letting the psychos roam around the streets and crack down on illegal gun trades instead of giving people speeding tickets for going 2 mph over the speed limit in the middle of nowhere you fucktards."
21242,"Breaking news: Serial killer enjoyed video games. He also drank coffee in the morning, and liked to watch Everybody Loves Raymond on the couch while he ate dinner."
21243,not enough violence or gore
21244,"I think the whole controversy over the ""No Russian"" is fucking ridiculous. It's a SKIPPABLE level and you don't even need to shoot the unarmed civilians. If you don't like it, don't play it. It's that fucking simple."
21245,I'm getting sick of negative media attention on video games. REAL WORLD VIOLENCE IS NOT CAUSED BY VIDEO GAMES. Mass shootings are not connected to video games. Anyone who says otherwise can go fuck themselves. I play violent video games and I don't fucking want to shoot people.
21246,Six Days In Fallujah looked really good people need to learn not to be so butthurt
21247,Bunch of candy ass newsreporters looking for excuses because nobody want to take the blame for thosefew bad apples out of the whole orchard. I hate when people go to video games as the reason for violence.
21248,"Personally, I am not a big fan of violent video games because it involves killing, Massacres, and violence. If you'd met me, you can tell that I don't like violence in virtual or in real life situations. Killing people for no reason is just insane and pointless."
21249,"if someones fucked up enough to go outside and start shooting other human beings then THEY WERE THAT FUCKED UP ANYWAY
hell if video games are what pushed them over the edge yeah ok fine but you cant blame gta or cod for the other 99% of the persons physiological issues"
21250,What about postal?
21251,"As Ed Boon said, it's just to HAVE FUN!!!!!"
21252,The lady at the end is amazing.
21253,"All this video does is remind me of how stupid people are. For some reason, the whole thing with PETA and pokmon still gets to me."
21254,"do they even understand what games are meant to be ? it's meant to make you experience and enjoy something that you can't do in real life without getting punishment to it, and it's also OUR choice if we want to play this game or not and if we like this genre or not !! i am 100% that these complains from parents of 10 year old kids who they gave money to and these kids went to buy violent games !! and it's also the fault of the store that let them buy the game!! DON'T BUY A VIOLENT GAME FOR YOU KID IF YOU ARE GOING TO COMPLAIN HOW OFFENDING IT IS."
21255,I love how most of the bitching is coming from Fox News.....
21256,MW2 FTW best game evar!!!!!!!
21257,It's entertainment!
21258,This always pisses me off. There is no reason to be blaming video games for stupid people doing stupid things... Its like if someone does drugs and watches breaking bad it's breaking bad's fault. It's stupid and people should stop being so stupid about it.
21259,No Russian was bad but it was skippablable and it's isnt just one thing that has nothing to do with the story it causes ww3 in the back half of mw2 and all of mw3 it's was a very important part but still one of my least favorite missions ever
21260,"For #4, I say it could have been a good idea. It could be a bit informative about what a war is really like, compared to all the other fpses out there. :P"
21261,Lol fuck Fox news.
21262,"it's not the game that made them violent, it's the parent that always keep the children from playing games does. - Personal Quote, personal experiences, & personal observations."
21263,it's always the american that ruins everything huh?
21264,I feel like the media just needs something to blame to get attention.
21265,Two words Anita Sarkessian
21266,"The conservative media eruption that inevitably rears its head post any shooting incident or release of a violent game is not only ignorant and pointless- but also actively harmful. Why is it ignorant? It seems as if some people don't actually understand what it takes to kill someone. It's not just an arbitrary decision- something that the layman can just 'decide' to do- nor is it something that any child who is raised with a modicum of morality could be conditioned into accepting. Killing someone requires a fundamentally different mentality, or years of conditioning. There's a reason that most of these mass murders are committed by 'sociopaths'- people who were inherently different and more likely to be accepting of killing in the first place- or just people who were never given an internal moral code (in which case the blame rests squarely on the shoulders of bad parents). Media that blames video games for these incidents is either servicing an underlying vendetta, or is downright stupid. How is it actively harmful? Simple. Isolating a variable that clearly isn't the cause and focusing all attention on that variable serves only to ignore the actual problem- the real causes of mass murders- and severely reduces our ability to come up with real solutions. It's also actually a little insulting- for every family that suffers at the hands of a mass murder- to focus media attention on 'video games' and false problems, as opposed to helping more, or trying to prevent repeat events. Fox news and company- start being helpful or just keep quiet. The world has enough real problems without you adding fake ones."
21267,everyone can piss off if they think like those dumbass reporters
21268,All these clips of people freaking out are all Fox news. All I hear from those people is 'what about the kids' You don't get to go out buy your brats a game then lose your shit when bad stuff happens. GOOGLE IS FIRST! Damn!
21269,"But you can be a female that can have sex with the men in mass effect, how is that any different?"
21270,OMG the government dosent know anything about video games they think that we are actually gonna kills someone in real life!!!!!
21271,If I can give my opinion to any media out there. I would like to say Game convert my violence aggressions in real life to violence in video games.  Literally if I don't play game maybe I would have been drop out of school right now. It help me kept my aggression towards other people at bay and kept me away from trouble. So I really think games are black sheep when it come to no 1 controversies.
21272,"Video Games aren't bad - if they're viewed at the right age. For example, a teenager (13+) playing an M rated game isn't too terrible. You let your 5 year old son without a concept of morality play GTA V or Saints Row 3 and don't parent them to show them what wrong is, and of course they're going to think killing people is fun/funny, because that's what they were taught by the game. The main issue isn't video games - it's ignoring ESRB and parents refusing to parent their children. They laugh and promote kids cursing and doing hip thrusting and other ""dirty"" motions because they find the sacrilege of kids' innocence funny. Before anyone denies this, on youtube alone, you can find so many more videos of that being done (parents laughing as their kids do inappropriate things) than how to parent correctly. As a society, we're messing up. It's not games, it's people."
21273,Always enjoy these videos..hope PS4 finally gets off their ass and brings out some decent first person shooters in the next year..fingers crossed but not holding my breath.
21274,"Pity me gaming world, for I am Australian."
21275,"I feel like making a video game about a war based off of the soilders' personal experiences is a really good idea. It's a way of documenting in our modern day that will appeal to a wider audience to educate them and make them aware of what is going on in our current world. I can understand where the parents are coming from, but at the same time they should be prepared for the war their children fought in to be documented, be it books, television, or even video games."
21276,Say what you will 6:00 was the best mission ever
21277,"You get 10 points for killing a cop, 25 for killing gang members, 30 for killing civilians, 40 for killing children and animals, 50 points for killing pregnant women Argentinian right wing news about GTA:San Andreas"
21278,"I get really annoyed when they immediately jump to the conclusion ""oh he played a shooter game, that must be why he killed those people.""  It's always blame the new thing. It can't be a simple matter of something wasn't right with the person to begin with or they were pushed too much and finally just snapped. Can't be that, must be the game he plays that caused it."
21279,"8:39
Too bad Real Life's ""cheat codes"" got leaked for ""Resistance"" to ""Natural Selection""... Or maybe Mother Nature has had enough and sent Cerberus to bite us in the ass, via Mental Illness."
21280,"Lets Bring back Manhunt style games, I miss the senseless violence lol"
21281,WELP... mine as well ban Skyrim as well cause we don't want kids going around shooting fire from their hands now do we.
21282,"RWS quote for PETA: ""'Disgraceful! said Gordon. 'Disgusting!' spluttered James. 'Despicable!' ended Henry.'"""
21283,"This should retitled to ""proof that fox is too sensitive to exist in the real world"""
21284,"oh man, these conservative media guys are fucking geniuses!"
21285,8:25 that's a bunch of bs!!!!
21286,"Why did the war game get banned? If other games such as Cod and battlefield (where there are Nazi's and is all about war, plus are also based on real battles such as Vietnam) can exist and can be so popular and profitable for those companies. Whats the issue with another game getting based on another war/battle were people lost their lives? Sure its a horrible thing war and death, however the dark and probably most graphic cod war game World at war made over 7.8m sales...
North America:	 4.60m	 64.9%
+ Europe:	 1.82m	 25.7%
+ Rest of the World:	 0.66m	 9.4%
= Global	7.08m	
It's why we buy them, not to be disrespectful towards the people who died, or misuse the fact we can re spawn and keep on killing other ""players""! But because its fun to just let out some steam while shooting/blowing up other players. That is also why we have age rating on games, because these games need to be used by a mature aged customer, so that they can understand and take into account what is happening. Leave a comment below if you agree or disagree, and please make it a mature response."
21287,WHO THE FUCK CARES ABOUT A FUCKING SHOOTER GAME
21288,No Russian = Funnest mission EVER! Do I want to kill people? Maybe sometimes lol but that mission has nothing to do with it.
21289,"The whole 6 days in Fallujah controversy really pissed me off. To set this occurrence of warfare apart from the others is insane. Yes, I understand that people lost their lives, but you don't see very single WW2 game catching flak from people who lost family in that war. What is the difference? Someone please explain, because I don't understand."
21290,"Why do people blame shooting just because of, they played fps games, it's the first thing they see and don't even realize other motives. Such as combuline, they were shooting because they got bullied or sandy hook because all his life he hunted."
21291,"Scientists are baffled by Australians and British people who play the same ""violent"" video games and somehow are able not to go on mass shootings."
21292,Notice almost all news clips against these games are from FOX news
21293,WTF
21294,Genesis / Mega Drive MK version FTW! Still have the original PAL cartridge that supports the full death moves
21295,T -T Gosh People just find every thing in life to blaim on video games 1]pokemon Peta can just go die in a hole. 2]never let your child spend at leat 12 hours on a shooter. 3] T - T Don't Blame Video Games.......Blame Miley Cyrus instead X D
21296,"You forgot the trill kill controversy around the mid 90s. It was to be a free for all fighting game like super smash bros. But adult and violent like motal kombat. EA was the maker. It was seen as bad, but also got pulled and became vaperwear. Not a big loss though, as it looked and played so bad according to Gamepro it's just as well it got shelved."
21297,"Butthurts
Butthurts everywhere"
21298,the press blame video games for such stupidass reasons
21299,For the shooting one it all boils down on making the decision to kill or not to kill because the video games don't make the decision the person with the gun does
21300,"Okay! I love Video Games, GTA is a fun game to play,Does that mean i want to go out side and shoot cops!?!? Fucking No!! People that believe in that are so fucking dumb! People Like that piss me off"
21301,"Telling me its violent, offensive and illegal...
Just makes me wanna play it even more."
21302,jesus politicians are stupid
21303,I play a lot of fantasy games that include violence and gore. So does that mean when I go out on a killing spree that I will use a sword?
21304,You know that the rateing system for video games are bull shit because parents get their 9 year old kids rated m games
21305,"I find it interesting that the Six Days in Fallujah game got so much flack for replicating war, but games like Medal of Honor & Call of Duty don't. Hell, games like 1916 or Wolfenstein take several liberties with history, despite taking place in World War 1 & 2 respectively. Sure, I understand that there is some controversy surrounding these games, but not for replicating war. I'm not saying that these games should be banned, as I feel that you should have the right to express your views in art, but we shouldn't pick on certain games for something if other games get away with similar actions. That's our media controlled double standards society."
21306,"""sex""box lol
""demonic"" pokemon? really?"
21307,"I'm a gamer from Australia, and I have to say it really pisses me off that they heavily sensor or ban games from coming here."
21308,The people criticizing mass effect are so stupid and ignorant. I could make the argument that men are also objectified because female Shepard can have sex with Garrus. Maybe they should find out more about a game before tearing it down.
21309,"saying someone played call of duty and was involved in a mass shooting doesn't mean that its the games fault, the media just needs something to blame it on."
21310,why the heck does the government need to get involved with this kind of stuff?? what ever happened to parents?
21311,"What? DOOM.. a game that includes demons from hell is satanic? Oh my god! Thanks media drones, and over sensitive parents.. I never would of guess that by myself! sarcasm"
21312,Fuck Fox news!
21313,I play shooter and war games. And i still couldnt tell you how to take the safety off real guns let alone which ones have a strong backfire :/
21314,I want face palm throughout the video
21315,Don't blame the games blame the parents for not controlling their kids
21316,Blaming VIdeo Games for the Security and Stupid people running around is fucking stupid. Just as useful as a fucking VCR!
21317,idiots lmfao
21318,if u only play gta when your angry lol
21319,"i understand the c.o.d airport one but come onnnn, all of the other ones are for entertainment and they are enjoyable if its to fregen gory for u or to fregen evil then dont play it and stop ruining it for others and gettin it banned for others,thx 4 informing us about this mojo"
21320,"Honestly, I don't really get shocked or disturbed by video games anymore. I've been a gamer for about 10 years and I've seen it all. I see games as games only, like an escape from reality something to have fun with, imo."
21321,3:44 mate I'm an aussie and it pisses me off we just don't want them in I hate that tell the prime minister to let those games in if we can allow gta5 anything can come
21322,"In regards to the MW2 ""No Russian"" level, I didn't see any problem with it being in the game for 2 reasons. 1, it gives you the option to skip it. And 2, if you felt the need to go through every level, you could just walk along staring at the ceiling the whole time if you wanted to. You don't HAVE to shoot the civilians, you could walk through the level without firing a single shot, I remember doing it before. I understand why it may bother some people playing the game, but the fact that you can play the entire game without even seeing that scene should have been enough to keep the whole 'controversy' at bay."
21323,Did anybody else notice that almost all of these had a clip from Fox News in it
21324,I just think that they need to shut up about all this becuse most of my family play games like cod or gta even my 5 yr old nephew playd cod when he was 2 or3 and hes is still playig at5 and heis not violent
21325,"For #9, it's funny how preachers like this try and leading people to God, by attempting (and in a pathetically poor way may I add) to make a game look like a ""tool for the devil"" if they have no material otherwise. I'm going to say this, I'm barely holding on to my faith as it is, because of people like this.
Also for any of the spot where the media is involved, they need to just need to stop dipping their grubby fingers in a realm the will never understand. Also regarding the #1 spot, they have NO FUCKING IDEA, what it's like, because apparently they had at least mostly sheltered lives. As far as I go, other than the few friends I do have, video games have been better to me than most fucking people have. At least I get a ""tongue lashing"" if I actually did something wrong, and not for being something that's called being a human-goddamn-being."
21326,"Man, people can be so uptight about video games. The reason that I'm not shooting people with guns in real life is because I'm shooting people with guns over the internet. When people realize that video games are used as an outlet of anger, it'll be a much better world with a lot less shootings and murders. Can you imagine how many horror movies would have ended quickly if the slasher played video games?"
21327,Video games do not cause people to do bad things. Screw the ignorant people who think otherwise!
21328,"7:36 Conservative Media. I'm not surprised at all. They probably want to have America go back to it's 18th century roots, with no freedom of religion(aside from christianity) and no rights for women.
Not to mention they think Climate Change is a political agenda and evolution is ""controversial"". It's pathetic."
21329,"5:35 I'm going to say this again: There was nothing wrong with a rated M game having a mature scene. It was good that Infinity Ward wanted to make an emotionally impacting scene for players to see how diabolical and manipulative the villain was. MW2 just wasn't the right vessel for it, with it's parody of action blockbuster movies. Honestly, the thing is, little children SHOULD NOT BE PLAYING CALL OF DUTY! If you don't want your little kid seeing it, don't buy it. It's not the game thats the issue, its the parents.
Also, if you(the player) are going to be in a terrorist cell, those terrorists better act like freaking terrorists.
And the part was skippable, anyway."
21330,"How about giving games a ""Sane people only"" rating?"
21331,3 and 4 are the only non ridiculous ones
21332,"Isn't it better to kill fake people than real people? 
And plus, Fox is a big pile of bologna."
21333,4:56 Dat ugly controller stereotype. I would never touch that thing.
21334,"What pisses me off is the logic from the media and stupid people:
A student did a mass shooting killing his classmates and teachers, they blame video games but not the weapons, which were locked in the safe, which he took the keys from his father (who is a hunter) and had a mental issue because he was getting bullied in school and nobody listened or helped him.
Yeah right...give games fault where we shoot at pixels and polygons..."
21335,Mortal kombat rules!!!
21336,That quote from the end of the fallujah controversy part made me want to punch that lady in the face. ITS A FUCKING VIDEOGAME! LIVE WITH IT!
21337,I play GTA and Mortal Kombat and I never went out punching people's heads off or shooting a whole sidewalk
21338,South park went even farther
21339,Interview with Yogscast Kim at 3:40
21340,it's interesting that most anti newscast are from fox
21341,i really do love the war games that is true that the games are messed upin some ways but the war games are fun i do pray for the lost lives that fought for us and im only 13
21342,wow that airport massacre was pretty graphic and realistic. Even as a gamer I can understand controversy against that
21343,I'm looking forward to see their reaction on Plague Inc. xD
21344,"You can go trough ""No Russian"" without shooting anyone..."
21345,Another thing that has occurred to me that I forgot to bring up the last comment is that a lot of people are uneducated and don't know what happened in these battles. Most people are going to brush off things like WWI and WWII to just say that it's the past. Most won't know the details of the battles or the war and will likely brush it off. So turning it into a video game that is historically accurate is another way of telling the story. A lot of people look at these games and think hmmm cool a war game and know nothing about the war and it's battles prior to playing. So to me as long as it is historically accurate and mentions the people involved as much as it can realistically ( Of course not every soldier can be listed in one video game ) I believe it should be okay to make video games on it. They seem to make them despite the controversy anyways. I love war games that are historically accurate and especially the ones that paint the big picture. I also don't mind the ones that are made from an idea of a possible future war such as WWIII scenarios as this is often thought about and discussed anyways. I see no reason to not make these games if they are accurate and honor the memory.
21346,Government and Entertainment don't go together very well. As has been said by many people many times over if you don't like what you see then don't partake. If you don't want your children seeing it then don't allow them to. You have to take serious caution when viewing on such content. Because the way people react is not the fault of the developers. It's the lack of viewer discretion and inability to handle things maturely that is at fault. If something was so bad that nobody could handle it then it likely wouldn't be released. These games are persecuted by groups with the wrong idea. I could understand if it was a video game that was completely insensitive and blatantly offends people simply for the purpose of doing so but more likely offending people is an accident and the content is meant for a mature audience of people.
21347,I love how most the people that get all fired up in video game controversies have no clue at all about games or what they're like. They just hop on the rabblerabblerabblerabble bandwagon and hope it impresses someone.
21348,how is pokemon witch craft?
21349,No Russian bloodiest ugliest mission of MW2 skipped no doubt
21350,Ahh. Good ol' Manhunt 2. Brings back memories
21351,Jesus Christ u people and your cod is fucking insanity
21352,Lol FoxNews.
21353,There actually are a whole lot less tragedy's of shootings since violent video games came out gamers take there anger out on people in video games instead of people in real life
21354,"Damn, not everyone is mentally unstable, these people are just stupid and ignorant."
21355,I would say people are going oh hey ill try this and that which leads to drugs and violence its not the games its the people themselves probably wanting to do it
21356,I saw pokemon black and blue in the intro
21357,Never played manhunt 2 before but it seen fuckin awesome!!!
21358,I freakin loved No Russian
21359,"Did PETA really do this....? Did it REALLY get upset about Pokemon being ""animal abuse""? Also, its funny to me that ""Conservative"" groups blame the video games, and ""Liberal"" groups blame the guns. So we end up going around in circles with pointless accusations, and never really changing anything."
21360,"gotta love when the news blames a video game for something, its even better if they NEVER PLAYED the game and know little to nothing about it... The worlds doomed."
21361,Just because some one kills in real life it is not video games to blame because killing has been around before video games seriously people it it is not the fault of video games.
21362,"It's not the video games that make people.... phsyco,  it's the people themselves. There's some fu*ked up people out there.
Pretty sure Bun Laden never got a killaminjaro in Halo."
21363,"Six Days in Fallujah will end up just like the Revolutionary/Civil/World Wars. Over time, people will accept it happened, would like to see it in history type films/shows. Then game makers will try again on it and be totally accepted."
21364,Fox News needs to stop talking from their asses
21365,"I remember someone who said they don't like GTA because you can rape people in it.
Seriously, if you're gonna debate on something, at least fucking know what about whatever your debating on. There isn't any ""rape"" option in GTA."
21366,The news and media will make up a lot of things to get a few more bucks.
21367,"IMO the whole GTA game series IS a bad idea. Reason? You MUST commit crimes, to win. The rest is bullshit, video games don't make you kill, you decide to or not."
21368,"I was personally annoyed about the '6days in Fallujah', i mean why do you think there are so many World War 2 movies? Even World War 2 games for that matter? Theyre all there to remind us, to show what people had to go through, TO REMEMBER THEM. If someone is laughing at a scene of man dying (that is based on a true event), its not the game, its clearly that person who has a problem...
And why are 'anti war activist' fighting against war with videogame controversies?? Shouldnt they be going to people who cause god damn wars? This game was even mentioned to have an objective to 'RETELL THE STORY' seriously, people are so ignorant sometimes.."
21369,"Remember guys, this is the same shit just in a different bag. Back 60 or 70 years ago, it was comic books that made kids evil. Then it became rock and roll as Elvis gyrated his hips. In the 80's it was violent movies like the Terminator and Conan. Now it's video games. Later on it will probably be something like VR. There's not much you can do about it aside from don't vote for the assholes that vote for this and don't watch the channels that spout this nonsense."
21370,"We need to ban Mortal Kombat! We wouldn't want little Timmy to go around spin-kicking people's heads off and shooting fire out of his hands, would we?"
21371,I like anal probes :(
21372,Why must they blain video games
21373,it telling the story of some thing that is real let it be said
21374,six days in fallujah shear her son died thats sad but if your great gram-pa died in the civil war and some body made a game about that what is your respond
21375,Well Australia beeing stupid again....
21376,Stupid Americans
21377,lol they are games people should just get over themselves and get a life and stop making problems when there are none
21378,"ok... so let me tell the news something. ""ist not the person who killed it w the gun"".my reason is that idiots are handed guns or dealed guns and then they use them without permishon we need someone who can stop this and i dont mean a stuid ass who said ""we need to bann vid games becose they are y thar a shootings. now take in coseiderashon that some crimes we comited and the man or women that did the crim has not played one vid game in his or her life so i dont see y we blame vid games for every thing but i dame well know that most shooting are done with elegel guns. guverment i have 6 words for u. ""get of your ass and help."
21379,call of duty has never made me feel uncomfortable playing until i played that level on mw2. it is the only one that i have ever felt uncomfortable playing
21380,The woman  you see in the Pokmon thing is actually the mother from the binding of issac
21381,The woman  you see in the Pokmon thing is actually the mother from the binding of issac
21382,"I like war games, but that part from MW II did send up a red flag for me. I honestly don't like GTA because it seems like pointless killing honestly. At least in war games it's to defend your country/men etc."
21383,"people assume video games affect people this way because no one wants to say: my son/daughter killed (#) people and hes never done anything thats encouraged it. people use video games as an excuse, rather a motive."
21384,That last one made me really mad.
21385,everytime its a teenage or a kid who kills a person they blame it on video games if they call of duty or gta there like oh my it these games which made them kill a freind or whatever no games were made for fun they didnt expect for people to take it as real life i mean really if kids can't spilt the real world from a virtual world parents should get them a less violent game like minecraft
21386,Hi
21387,"Well, anyone remember ""Blame Canada"", from South Park? This is like that but it's video games this time"
21388,"I play gta and that means i am a killer... so if i play goat simulator i am a goat, if i play surgeon simulator then i am a doctor and if i play need for speed i am a driver... that makes so much sense ... brb gotta preform a surgery while in my car on a highway with a goat head..."
21389,These ignorant idiots don't have any clue on the concept of video games. I feel bad for gamers and game companies receiving all this bullshit
21390,Wolfenstein 3D
21391,"Virtual guns kill just as bad as real ones? HERE'S A QUESTION: There is a rock, a sword and a pistol in front of you. Which of the three causes the most damage?........ The answer is of course NONE OF THEM! Nobody is holding them, nobody is wielding them. They're just there, untouched and unused. WE kill, the weapons do not!!! ""Stricter gun laws""??? Those stupid idiots! How about stricter laws against a-holes who think it is the guns and not the people who massacre civilians!"
21392,"Oh my fuck. People are retarded.
They mad cuz they bad"
21393,Media need to stay away from video games
21394,Liquid Snake was right. Humanity has gone soft.
21395,"I would say the that the ""No Russian"" mission from WM2 should be #1 or 2. Mainly because that was the only time I havehesitated in a game like ""Wait, I have to do what?"" and I have played things tons of games. And why does the news have to blame games for stuff like that?"
21396,I think it's dumb people who have really bad issues should not play toes games like gat and cod
21397,"Those idiots so eagerto restrict every form of media, communication and visual art would find themselves at perfect ease in a fascist country. Fucking Mussolini was easier with censorship..."
21398,Hey let's blame games on everything instead of Movies
21399,Been playing gta since i was 6. So far i have killed 0 people. I must be broken or something.
21400,"Apparently always need something to blame other than bad parenting, shouldn't parents already have taught the difference between games and reality, hell if it was music and tv then, it's video games now"
21401,I fuckin' hate when people blame video games for stupid shit like this damn the news
21402,"guns don't kill people, people kill people"
21403,I'm adopted and I thought the Portal adoption jokes were nice and immersive.
21404,4:03 where can I get that
21405,Gotta love how fox news is the one getting their pampers in a bunch in most of these examples.
21406,Wall of them all of them piss me off ther w more murders before games games lower it they can be used as outlets
21407,I thought we covered this be4 ... GAMES DON'T MAKE PPL VIOLENT !!! ... (lag does)
21408,"I don't get how conservatives can love guns so much, and then get offended when a video game depicts people using guns for what they were meant to be used for. It's like if someone was obsessed with sports cars, and then got horribly offended when Grand Turismo came out and showed people driving them really fast."
21409,manhunt is awesome I want 3rd sequel to come out :(
21410,This is so bullcrap why in thw world people blame games for everting like pokemon being satanic or even blaming guns in games or gore oh how i hate you anti war activists peole and hippies protesting against fire-arms.
21411,"The thing about video games and violence is that ive played relatively violent games, but as far as im concerned im mashing buttons and doing just that: PLAYING A GAME. if someone fails to realize that, then theres something wrong with them, not the game developers. however, i do think some games go a little too far, and im pretty sick of the rule ""the more realistic the graphics, the gorier the game"""
21412,Okay. I will say something here. These news reporters are fuckin ideots. Video Games do not kill people. People being fuckin loopy does!
21413,Who is the guy from Florida mentioned but not named in #1 thing? Slightly confused and curious I have become.
21414,Game makes fun ofadoption really? that's the best story you got?
21415,Wait kim?
21416,Poor Autralia :(
21417,I'm surprised postal 1-2-3 aren't on the mentions i love the game but you can do a lot of messed up shit on that game
21418,The babies from dead space didn't make it?
21419,"It never surprises me that the news media points their blaming finger at video games, film, music, and other forms of media expect the one thing that might actually be the culprit: the news media itself. The sick fucks who want to make their mark on the world see how much coverage these shootings get and want to follow that blaze of glory route. The real way we can try to deter copycat killings is to stop covering these tragic events 24-7, but of course the news will never do that, because nothing gives out ratings like dead children."
21420,"It's reckless to blame anything in the wake of a bloodshed. It is better to wait and analyze the facts. Whether it's left or right news media, they are always quick to blame and generally wrong. Politics needs to back off. People (and parents) need to make decisions for themselves. You don't need the brute force of government to solce anything.
Good list btw."
21421,"(Either the Poke`mon or the Portal 2 one, they were just itchin to get down on popular video games)"
21422,"To sum up, Americans are incredibly stupid"
21423,"So, video games cause bad behavior? Tell me, how does playing Mario Kart or Need for Speed make me a murderer?"
21424,Oh fox news......you will always blame the games XDXDXDXDXD
21425,It's all about the blood code.
21426,Lucky we don't have news channels blaming video games for mass shootings in the UK likely due to our gun laws being very strict therefore making gun crimes a lot rarer than in most countries.
21427,"nothing annoys me more than people who know nothing about video games blame them for shootings it pisses me off, video games are a release from he bull shit many of us have to put up with from people"
21428,All of Dem pissed me off
21429,"Shut up, you are thinking way too much of Pokmon. (Seriously shut up you are yelling over a game that goes pika pika)"
21430,Kim from the Yogscast! :D
21431,So mass murderers like Hitler had video games?
21432,"no russian mission could have been better. and pokemon being demon figures was the most stupidest thing i have ever seen. people and i admit my father actually believed such stupidity just bc it was on the News and media. eventually people just forgot about it eventually when it got out of style, but thanks to them i could not watch pokemon show when it came on tv which was the only thing worth watching on tv when it came on at night."
21433,its simple u don't like it don't play it!!!
21434,Old people on the media talking about video games... What could go wrong? :|
21435,Dumbass news reporters
21436,whats so stupid about falujah is its like a documentary in videogame form
21437,LOL @ ESRB..
21438,"Such idiots. I'm tired of people assuming things without proper knowledge. People think they know more than psychologists who've stated MANY times that video games are not linked in any negative way to human behaviors besides improved reflexes and decision making.
What an utter disgrace it is to see how weak society has become with their idea of being ""politically correct"" which is based on nothing but subjective ideals is.
Like the thing about Portal 2 making an adoption joke, I have 2 adopted friends (not adopted by the same parents) and they said they laughed at the part of the adoption joke. They were 14 at the time. If they could get over it, these dumbasses who weren't even adopted can get over themselves too instead of trying to speak out for a population they can't even relate to.
The mission ""No Russian"" in Call of Duty was a bit bad, but it wasn't anything you couldn't shake off. It's just a game. Toughen up and learn the story before you go off criticizing it.
When I'm done with high school, I'm leaving for the military. I wouldn't mind you making a video game about a war I was in if I died in it or was still living. My brother in law is an Drill Sergeant in the Army Rangers and he says he wouldn't mind if you made one of the places he was in, even though he saw some messed up stuff. I think it's best to by the opinions of the actual vets not the people attempting to speak for them.
Now I hate the fact that I can't play Manhunt 2 without some censors because of some overly-sensitive punks off somewhere being offended. People with no experience in the psychology field should never be allowed to make these decisions.
I wish they'd stay away from our games and movies.
You have to be such a bitch to be upset about Pokmon. I'm all for animal rights (except like those PETA idiots who get upset about the slightest things) but holy shit, this game isn't a big deal.
I wish people would just learn to move the hell on."
21439,"How abou we just practice personal responsibility, folks?"
21440,Whenever the government doesn't have an excuse for shootings they always blame video games. ( and FUCK YOU NSA).
21441,"I really was pissed off when last year, a group of christian people were saying that video games are bad as they get players to believe in fantasy instead of god. Then they list a bunch of games,"
21442,Whats the song in the background?
21443,Whats the song in the background?
21444,"This is only an opinion but, I feel that when I play a shooter I don't want to go out and kill someone myself.  If anything it shows me how graphic it could be and I wouldn't to see it in real life."
21445,"10 years ago it was ""blame the video games"". Today it's ""blame the meds"". I wonder who or what will be the scapegoat in a few years from today."
21446,"Recently here in Brazil, a kid was accused of kill his entire family with a gun, and guess what they blame? Videogames. Only because the kid had Assassins Creed wallpaper in his facebook, the media blamed the game for the kid's crime ( although it is not proved that the kid committed the crime).
The media gave superficial information about the game, that in the game you are part of a organization that kill anyone without reason, and it influenced the kid. Ridiculous!"
21447,When I played MW2 I didn't expect going into the airport to shoot people up so all I did was watch but not shoot.
21448,three words: FUCK THE MEDIA!!!!!!!
21449,I notice all the controversial channels are Fox!
21450,"at 7:08 with the kid in her lap, isn't that the mother from the beauty pageant in bad grandpa?"
21451,play GTA but you dont see me in real life shooting up a whole sidewalk
21452,Yeah the media are real pains in the ass with regard to video games
21453,i hate living in australia
21454,which GTA game was it at 4:03
21455,Here is a good story. I was in gamestop and i saw a mom let her 7 year old kid buy gears of war 2. now that game is one of the most gore heavy games ive played. Now a kid of that age shouldnt be playing it. But if youre like 12 or 13 ya go for it. If you know the difference between the game and real life then have fun.
21456,"The ""No Russian"" mission really got to me. It's incredibly racist and horrifying to look at with those people just piled up on top of each other... DEAD!"
21457,"War-based games seem offensive to me, maybe that's just me"
21458,The whole Mass Effect controversy was just stupid and is the sole reason why I hate Fox News
21459,dos'nt FOX News have anything better to do
21460,"Man, if Fox News would just FUCK OFF with this social bullshit it'd be the worst nightmare for Democrats as it's the only thing preventing them from stealing everyone's money and using it to buy votes"
21461,fuck off fox news
21462,If you play Call of Duty you are a potential threat to social harmony and safety. If you join the forces and shoot people with real guns to death you are a goddamn patriot and a hero. Hypocrisy at it's finest.
21463,their just jelly that they did not have these awsome games when they where yong so every one please spam these news sites with this message ''don't blame games for these shooting because you did not have these games when you where tiny''
21464,It was a no button for modern warfare 2 u didn't have to play it
21465,i hate people who b*tch about good games i wish to destroy them. but i guess i won't because they don't deserve death
21466,Cracks me up how folks blame the video games when some kid gets crazy and starts doing insane things. WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE PARENTS?!?!?!?
21467,no russian was an option
21468,I think if a video game gets blamed for a massacre or even makes the news for being controversial then the company should release the statistics on how many people bought the game and how many of those people have committed a massacre.
21469,I know i'm most likely gonna get hate but please hear me out. Most of these controversies have nothing to do about most of the games its just sick twisted minds of reporters and yes i will admit i have done the no Russian mission in MW2 and yes i felt a little bad but i feel like i have a good conscious because i did what people should do if they hate this mission don't fire the weapon and let the others do it...Controversies that go on with mass shootings happening only because of first person shooters? If your dumb enough to raise a gun to a living persons head and pull the trigger out of either anger or hatred then is it the games fault or the user just cause people play first person shooters doesn't mean anything linking to violence its the persons fault not the games...
21470,It pissed me off so much I killed everyone (that crap is true so I wouldn't be saying if those killers Weren't  introduced into video games they still would of killed)
21471,Number one is easily the thing that pisses me off most
21472,Wrong Im Australian and SR4 is legal here
21473,wow 92 ......dam i was playing MK at 5 .....and ive never killed anyone and doom at the same age .....stupid people cause violence not video games
21474,"This is stupid why cotroversy. Its not like you HAVE to buy it. You buy it at your own risk why should they care 
If people buy then so be it.  Luv your vid. Mojo"
21475,Anti war people are idiots you keep peace with no war and not be a tyrant.
21476,"It's almost funny how some governments like Australia think they have the right to shield their citizen's and just pretend like violence doesn't happen. It is not their job to tell their citizens what they can't do. Unless it is affecting someone else's well being there should be no reason they can't expose themselves to violence in games. Some governments need to remember their job's. They are here to protect their citizens from danger and harm not to censor what they do for entertainment. They were created by the people, are funded by the people, elected by the people, and most importantly they work for the people, they don't own their citizens. I do understand that some violence that is based on real events should be LIMITED so it doesn't offend anyone who lost their loved ones in that event. Other than that don't shield people from violence especially if it is based on something that is taking place or could really happen. The more people are shielded from the real world the more uneducated they become about what is taking place in the outside world."
21477,"I'm sorry, but Manhunt 1 was more violent than the second."
21478,Fucking the government should mind their own business
21479,Wutta bout' the game 'JFK reloaded'? That game is sooo controversial.
21480,The media needs to stay the hell out of video game business. It's getting really old and tiring
21481,"If you are offended by something as arbitrary as a fucking video game, you are a fucking moron. If you can't tell the difference between fiction and reality, don't play them."
21482,-_- if video games cause people to be violent tell me what kind of video game have been playing for the past 5 thousand years
21483,We have killedeach other before Pong came out
21484,"maybe the media should look at, oh i don't know. THE FACT YOU CAN GET A 50 CALIBER SNIPER RIFLE ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES!?
instead of the games that put you in the shoes of united nations peacekeeping troops who use violence as a last-resort."
21485,"Videos like this make me hate the media in the USA.
Idiots blame virtual guns when people use real guns"
21486,"Mojo, usually I agree with you and enjoy your lists but the title of this list is misleading. It should be titled:
""Top 10 Most RIDICULOUS Video Game Controversies""
MSNBC has less than an average of 1 million viewers. The average viewing age of Fox News audience is 60+. CNN is notorious for calling things 50/50 and never taking a stance. And if that doesn't work they ignore all other news and focus on a missing airplane for five months.
I didn't keep count but I know as much as half of these ""controversies"" were trumped up by Fox News solely for ratings and distractions from coverage of important ongoing news issues.
In my mind unless one of these ""controversies"" had IGN or G4 or some other recognized gaming media or unbiased news organization reporting on it then it was never a controversy. Even those trumped up by politicians (such as Hillary Clinton) were almost always for political posturing. Far be it from they take actual hardened stances on issues such as our prison system, education, economy, etcetera. No instead the set up shop to take pot shots at something so inconsequential as video games.
Are some of these controversies? Of course. Mortal Kombat was big. The ""Hot Coffee"" thing from GTA was big also. Those were actual controversies. An argument could even be made for the false charges against video games being the cause of most mass shootings. Again, a convenient scapegoat in order to escape facing and addressing the main cause of the issue.
The Mass Effect ""Sex Scene."" As soon as I saw that I knew this list was going to be a farce.
WatchMojo, I enjoy your videos and will continue to watch them but this list misses the mark and then some."
21487,Se-xbox lol
21488,it's like saying it's racist in SCP containment breach cause a black guy is killed...
21489,"FREAKING POKEMON!? wow people wow plus the whole ""my son would laugh when someone died or he didn't die"" thing kinda is annoying MY DAD ACT'S LIKE IT'S TRUE! i know people say like o itz cazz viedu gamz uh huh sureeee"
21490,"So if a sex scene lasts only a minute, it's not controversial? Hmm ..."
21491,anything with fox news says is controversial completely ignores any kind of evidence and constantly lies about well pretty much everything fox is nothing more than a one sided circus with no brains or talent
21492,So why was a game about some real middle eastern battle controversial? WWII was real too and there's plenty of games about that.
21493,"I always hate how people use videogames as a scapegoat, I mean yeah deaths are tragic however when people blame videogames it's wrong. I play violent videogames I admit however does this lead me to have psychopathic tendencies? NO! Stop blaming videogames because people were killing long before they were released."
21494,"Wow, America really cares about that O.o ?"
21495,Politicians: Whiny little bitches
21496,"from having worked at gamestop I can say that as it is our job to inform parents of the content of video games. example; sex scenes in Red Dead Redemption, fatalities in Mortal Kombat, etc. PARENTS decide to buy these games for their CHILDREN. so for video games producers to be blamed for content of the game, I believe is not fair and just to them. they have the rating system for a reason AND YET parents ignore it because video games are the ultimate babysitter. so think about that before blaming the manufactures for any wrong doings maybe you shouldn't buy your 8 year old Saints Row or Grand Theft Auto.. which has happened to me on several occasions."
21497,OMG its just games the media and those other people making a big deal over nothing
21498,That number one is so right to be number 1.Its do stuid how people think that video games lead to that. Video games dont do that!
21499,Pues a la gente mayor le gusta la guerra y punto pero quien lo toman enserio serian los nios rata que hay que detener!!
21500,"thats retarded. manhunt 2 had the best story line i ever saw in a video game. when i thought i was fighting for my freedom, it turned out not to be the case. manhunt 2, 5 out of 5 stars."
21501,"What I think people don't get with some games like CoD etc, is the story telling element. People can read a book and the same thing can happen in a game and people won't think of that as big of a push as the game for whatever the player/reader does afterward. I understand a lot of controversial games such as Manhunt and stuff may be a bit indulgent, however, video games are not meant to cause people to go into a killing frenzy. People who are unstable and shouldn't be exposed to violent stimuli, shouldn't be. So parents etc, before blaming your kid for beating up another kid at school and blaming it on the boxing game you bought for them, realize that it's not the games fault and that the kid obviously has a problem if they act out like that."
21502,Well that was an easy #1
21503,Before video games were popular they blamed Dungeons and Dragons for violence in kids and said it was satanic.
21504,"What I have to say about #1 is ""If guns kill people, then pencils make mistakes and spoons make people fat."""
21505,"The news: ""He liked shooting games and went on a mass murder, therefor shooting games are satanic.""
Although everyone and there mothers like shooting games, and only a handful amount of people are murderers. Therefor, that's a coincidence."
21506,Not gonna lie...i love C.O.D. But when that airport scene came upi just couldn't pull the trigger haha. Pathetic i know...
21507,Pokemon... and ill keep being Pokemon.... people really need to think what they are saying before talking outloud
21508,"when people were kids they played games that imitated war now there just virtual its just shows the blame game , like when they used to say rock and roll caused violence ....."
21509,"Pokemon?! Seriously? How many idiots do we let run this country...Home of the proud...suuuurreee. What political idiots, and i'm being ""politically"" correct Hardyharhar...Morons. Really now?"
21510,"THIS is why you should NEVER listen to the media. Whether it's fox new or cnn it's brainwashing bull shit.
""Pokemon is satanic"" LOL! shut the fuck up, your 'god' couldn't give two fucks about pokemon"
21511,Did he just call Call of Duty realistic?
21512,Yawn
21513,Where is Postal?
21514,"I'm sorry, but I laughed so hard I could no longer take you seriously when you specifically named conservative news outlets as being the ones who persist with the connection between shootings and video games. CNN and MSNBC are just as bad as, if not worse than, Fox."
21515,"My question here is,
If Phoenix Wright doesn't make me a lawyer, how do shooters make me a gunman?"
21516,"i'm going to say something rather controversial myself, when looking to see whether videogames have an effect on the likelihood of an individual going on a mass murder/crime spree, perhaps you should look at the people who are finding ways to do them legaly, now I have nothing agaist armed forces but those signing up to be given a gun and shoot people should probably make you more worried than a guy who gives himself repetitive strain injuries on a games controller. im not saying all people who join armed services are whackjobs but I am saying I would be more careful around one if they moved next door, as they have done these things that people go nuts over, and have been paid for it."
21517,When that bitch said that military game shouldnt be released cause her son didnt get the chance to start over when he died.. thats the whole point of a fucking video game!!
21518,people kill because people are retarded and uneducated.Video games are just video games and if kids or anyone kills because of their influence over them well maybe those people should be put down.He who eats the most marbles doesn't grow up to have kids of their own!
21519,"How about the DmC with the horrible reboot and the new devs shitting on the core fanbase with the FUCK YOUs, Abortion via Sniper, Gaming ""journalists"" and squirrel semen? or Dragon's Crown being lambasted for tits by feminazi and ""journalist"" when the game is hyper-stylized and has nothing to do with the game or story? Made 2013 real funny and exposed how shitty gaming ""journalists"" are"
21520,Whats the game at 3:30
21521,"That pokemon part is sad, looks like we're going back to middle age !"
21522,... We should let the new broadcast everything about video games. Seems they know more about them and what they do than anyone else in the world.
21523,All from FOX
21524,game at 3:30?
21525,wish the news would just...not fucking exist their alwas making shit up pushing blame and exadurating EVERYTHING
21526,"What pissed me off: ""guns r bad bcus thay kil ppl so we shuld take them awey from ppl that rnt criminalsls so they cnt hafe guns but a criminalals kant either bcus they folow lawss to"" - Government after every shooting, a criminal will kill someone if they want to but i'd much rather have a gun at my side when i'm about to be murdered."
21527,"To all idiots who think video games cause your mentally insane child to go on a massacre, remember this...the games are impossible to teach you how to handle a gun well. A lot of things need to be considered when handling a gun, like aiming. There's this thing I like to call Gunnel vision, basically when you are in a stressful situation, like a warzone, your aiming becomes shit, because you are thinking about all the things. Well what about school shootings? Those mother fucking cowards don't have to worry a lot about aiming because the areas are in close spaces and the victims are packed tight, so it's easy pickings for the killers. If these assholes had guts they would go after targets that fought back, because if they are going to kill our future doctors and artists cause they couldn't get a date with a girl, they deserve every goddamn torture known to man kind."
21528,What game was showed on the last part of the video with the chainsaw guy?
21529,"If people think Pokemon is satanic, evolutionist, and is animal abuse, I have a few points why it is not
1. The pokemon like to fight.
2. The evolution is more of a metomorphesis. (sorry if I misspell)
3. You try to stop the abusers!"
21530,I really wish 6 days in Fallujah was made. I don't get why we can make serious war movies but videogames are considered to be devoid of artistic merit.
21531,top ten games to movies
21532,Yay yogscast refrence!!
21533,Who the fuck is going to go on a violent and crazy rampage just because some 3D models in a video game say its's ok. Anyone who would create a mass shooting is insane already.
21534,"It makes me angry when people say that these games are ruining there children. If there child is not sane or intelligent enough to play the game and not let effect their outside world  don't let them play it, plus those people don't realize it's just a game!!!!"
21535,Now I am a guy who has watched some disturbing shit but for some reason the No Russian mission kinda disturbed me and I was kinda shocked that this kind of stuff was in Cod 2
21536,"I completely agree with the ''No Russian'' mission from MW2. I didnt want to do the mission but sometimes, you dont have a fooking choice"
21537,pokemon is a world of the demonic what about jigglypuff.
21538,I'm surprised you didn't put Splatter House
21539,I feel that for me video games are an outlit so people don't do stuff like that in real life
21540,What about Postal? It is awesome but controversial
21541,"For #1, maybe USA should look at the fact that they allow people who are known to be mentally unstable to own large amounts of firearms whom then go on mass killing sprees rather than blaming the games that are played by millions.
If games were to blame then wouldn't there be millions of shootings to match the millions of people playing sed games??
Maybe they should look at controlling the amounts of real guns that people have and use, than the virtual guns that they use."
21542,The last one is fucking retarted there have been studies that show people dont want to kill people from playing a video game like honestly
21543,"always in the us, they authorize guns and shit but make a deal out of sex scenes and pokemon.."
21544,People need to garden the fuck up and stop being such pansies seriously they're video games key work there being VIDEO
21545,"Omg, it's only mental illness someone who is perfectly normal would not wake up one morning play GTA, and say, ""you know what, I am going to go and kill people because it's possible in a video game"""
21546,I think Australia is on to something with their approach to games...
21547,mahunt was a horrible game.... the graphics are shit all they focused on was the gore it has litterally no story line its horrible
21548,"Yeahh, I love controversial controversies. Interesting vid. good work mojo."
21549,They should have had Thrill Kill
21550,"No. 8
Was that blonde at the end the white girl from Different Strokes who died from a drug overdose?"
21551,If someone can tell me how I could play Manhunt 2 for the PC that'd be fantastic.
21552,What about the Muslim ties in Legend of Zelda:Ocarina of Time?
21553,"wow i had no idea! i JUST played gun game on call of duty, had alot of fun! i am now going to unload and lock up all my guns for home defense just in case i go on a murderous rampage!!!!"
21554,Its not the gun its the man
21555,It's just video games like wow. Fuck you Fox News
21556,"For number one, one of the mass shootings happened in my home state..."
21557,"I've noticed over the years and you can even see itin this listthat controversy surrounding video games has shifted from a more generally ignorant andalarmist one, to more specific and topical issues which I think is a good thing. I think the age of the Jack Thompson (Who no one even in law takes seriously anymore)esque madness with loosely tying games and violence or specific disasters together is generally coming to a close.
Most of it I think was born of just ignorance and a huge generation gap combined with individual opportunists like Mr Thompson or parts of broadcast media, and since the generations that did grow up with video games are beginning age to the point where its a norm you don't be seeing things quite like the 90s or early 00's again.
Not to say there still won't be controversy, but at least its becoming moreover specific topics like the credit card PSN debacle, or the issue with recreating Fallujah rather than just vague fear mongering."
21558,Actually do some research before you talk about something Fox News. Seriously.
21559,number one is true and really pissed me off because the people do the shooting are the ones to blame not video games. like lets sayim playing gta its not like the game can tell any one to shoot up a school. I think some people on the news need some thing to bitch about
21560,6 Days in Fallujah is the equivalent of the Call of Duty franchise consisting of only WW2 games. If their aim was to retell a story then why the hell not?
21561,OLO 4:17
21562,LMAO pokemon is DEMONIC!!! Wtf?
21563,"May I ask just who the hell researched this?
Or was the aim ""TOP 10 AMERICAN video game controversies""?
I would have bet money on seeing Rule of Rose here, seeing as what a stir it had created in Europe, Australia and New Zealand and how the developers actually had to personally promise Sony America that all claims regarding their game are wrong.
After all, this game is banned WORLDWIDE with just a few countries being a exception to ever publishing it (leading to this game being one of the most expensive game of the recent years). There had been the most ridiculous claims, from burying children over on-screen rape of teenagers to extreme violence against kids (some claiming that you can kill them). All of these are wrong and the only sin this game ever did was to serve a horrible combat system.
And you overlook that? A game that got released only in the USA, Japan, France and Italy (and maybe a handful of small countries that no one heard about) because FALSE statements made all hell break loose everywhere else? Hell, its on the same stage as Manhunt regarding the controversy, with the only difference being that Manhunt is somewhat justified.
And you don't even put the game in the Honorable Mentions.
I am really just not understanding who the heck researched these controversies. Or better: who was able to skip one of the biggest controversies of the last few years."
21564,"Some people are idiots, GAMES DON'T CAUSE VIOLENCE! It's parents who are the problem, if you don't make it clear that these things are terrible, then this happens."
21565,"Seriously computer, you can't run at 480P on this video, I SAW YOU RUN AT 780P aA MINUTE AGO! Jesus Christ."
21566,the problems with media is that they pick apart games and the violence and negativity they cause. comparatively i see the media bash on other forms of entertainment such as movies or music at a much slower and infrequent rate.and the women in the last media report of the episode said it perfectly its not the form of media its the people who use these forms and either get a hold of something they shouldn't have due to parental negligence or just an accident. people are in a sense unpredictable you don't know who has what problem and what will be too far or scar someone into a state of instability....fricking uptights.
21567,"Listen - Video Games. Video = Online. Game = Fake for enjoyment. HOW IS THIS AN ISSUE!!! Most people realize that in a game you can kill millions and it's fine, BECAUSE IT'S FAKE! They would likely NEVER do that in real life!"
21568,video games have NOTHING to do with real life murders it is the killer's choice to murder not the game
21569,i am 100% agree in something. the scene from mvw2 where you are a terrorist and kill a bunch of russian in the airport. that scene was.... horrible. it made me feel like i did kill people... it was like oh no.. what am i doing!!! but anyway it was a game simulation
21570,"Nah, it's not virtual guns to blame, it's the American government to blame for allowing guns to be legal in the first place. Now people just show off the size of their guns and we're just asking ""shouldn't that go towards the military?"""
21571,5:57 wtf DD: Thank you Fps shit you did it again. I can't believe that useless piece of shit game like Call of duty keeps getting popular and keeps shredding the reputation of much better meaningful games to pieces.
21572,Wouldn't gta be helping. After all this allows people to get rid of their anger.
21573,"this list is bullshit, there plenty of japanese hentai games that cop a lot of flak and controversy"
21574,"news casts need to fuck off about video games, someone needs to tell them that there was violence before video games and TV and everything electronic. Violence is in the human nature and if you can't live with knowing that well then just go fuck yourself."
21575,"The they are stuck in the past were video games never existed, ""oh back in my day it was peaceful"" Oh hell to the no, Remember the mob? bandits? Train robbers? Bank robbers? Terrorist threats? ""yeah it's completely safe without games, yeah Psychopaths would not exist hur hur hur derrrrrr."" Oh wait don't forget Jack the ripper."
21576,Why is everyone a retarded racist against games if they want to know why the kids are killing everyone blame the schools the drive people INSANE!!!!!
21577,Their just games if u go out and shoot someone after youre fucked in the head to stqrt with
21578,Pfft. Fox news is psychologically damaging.
21579,I despise overly religious people.
21580,... I was wondering why Australia missed out on so many good games... Really? We have the most dangerous crap on the planet here and we cant get violent games? and here I was blaming the import people. Its not their fault the rating system apparently sucks.
21581,"The only thing that upset me in this video was the way they lied about the roles and male manipulation of women in mass effect. Putting ASIDE the fact that the player can play as either male or female, - which in itself should debunk most sexist arguments, considering you're treated the same either way - I grew genuinely emotionally attached to the characters in that game. Really, that mission on Virmire messed me up for a while. That game and series is about so much more than that one-minute sex scene. Although you can be quite mischievous, should you choose to be, if you choose the paragon path, the game can be very meaningful and inspiring. What better allegory of life and morality than that?"
21582,"Is anybody else noticing that most of these ""news"" stories are Fox?"
21583,"Conservatives sure love violent videogames, because it gives them an scapegoat any ill-informed citizen can jump unto. That way they won't have to worry about people blaming real social issues, like the wide availability of firearms, for mass shootings perpetrated by young people."
21584,"The MW3 ""Player being a terrorist, too realistic"" crap? That's absolute idiocy. Having to kill those people, and knowing they're civilians, knowing they're unarmed. That sends a pang of guilt to any player. That's what it is MEANT to do. We shouldn't censor or remove things from our games because someone talks about morals, or thinks it's too ""realistic"". If anything it should be even worse than what it is. People don't understand the real emotion and horror that war is, including things like the massacre of civilians, and things like that, exposing players to that, will resensitize us."
21585,blah blah wah wah wah get a real job other than criticizing awesome games
21586,I have played the pokemon spinoffs and they are SHIT!
21587,Every gta controversy because it's not the games fault it's the person who bought the game because the game is M for Mature which means that your smart enough to know not to go out and do what the game did
21588,there just games people there fucking fake
21589,"Yeah, the video games are the problems, definitely not the guns that can be bought on every corner in America... that would be preposterous! Blame the games..."
21590,"....seriously?? Iv played GFA 5 and killed people with out hesitation but in real life I wouldn't even want to kill an animal never mind a human being why does media have to overeat over these things.........some I agree with but some like ""wwwaaaaaa???"""
21591,why cant the old days come back when nobody was such a sensitive bitch about religion and stuff like that? Say something moderately racist and everyone gets pissed off!
21592,"Why do people blame video games? It is called the shooters are stupid and have a history of ""violence"" amd also, people should know better then to mimick violent video games"
21593,"I live in Australia and i have most of the games on this list and have had to the option to buy all of them. games that are ""banned"" are actually sold in stores."
21594,The controversies about Pokmon is straight up BULLSHIT!!!
21595,"SUEING THE CREATORS OF DOOM BECAUSE OF COLUMBINE, THOSE ASSHOLES!!!!"
21596,When do these idiots gonna learn that some videogames are made for ADULT viewers only!!?
21597,"Playing dentist simulator doesn't make me a dentist
Playing goat simulator doesn't make me a goat
Playing Sherlock Holmes doesn't make me a detective
So why should games with death in it make me a killer?
Stupid news reports and media"
21598,omg its a game who cares
21599,"Simple thought, parents don't buy your kids video games that are 17+ cause your kid cant buy it with out being carded. So get your head outta your ass grow the fuck up and take the game away from them, and don't buy it for them. For people thinking that violent video games are wrong we aren't telling you to buy them but this is a free country we have the tech leave us alone you hippie freaks."
21600,its kim from the yogscast at 3:47
21601,Lesson learned: Offend the prudes for free press and publicity!
21602,YOGSKIM!!!! <3
21603,"ok, if somebody asked me to grab a gun and go on a rampage in a city I would call the police. If somebody said ""hey there is a video game where you can go on mass shootings in a city"" I would be like GIMME THAT GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! video games do not effect your mind in ways that would make you feel that it is necessary to go on mass shootings."
21604,Are you serious?! The news complains about a little dark humor in portal? (I know that's not the only thing but seriously?!)
21605,"Remember guys, video games caused a majority of the horrible atrocities throughout history...I hate people."
21606,"I once played GTA 4 by mistake and ended up killing 53 people with a banana. After rehab and playing Goat Simulator, i'm now living the goat life, enjoying the absolute lack of physics and gravity and generally being a goat. 421."
21607,"is it just me or are all protestors retards? i mean they preach about stuff but never check into what there really about or do any research at all...then end up looking utterly insane on tv or where ever they protest...none of them make sense and none of what they see wrong witha topic comes close at all or even is in the ball park...its like looking at a red balloon and going it looks like the devil....its evil...makes no god damn sense
...the only exception on this list was mortal kombat..everything else was retarded and made no sense"
21608,Congress finds out about banned from equestria daily
21609,"Wait, what??? Pokemon teaches you how to use magic spells??? Where did he find that out??? I want that!!!!"
21610,Soooo i don't un derstand why the government is tracking bakc down on video games like there werent mass murders or shootings before the games came out evn=en in MW2 they had an option to skip the terrorist mission and i feel more people would get voilent if they government did start limiting gaming hourss
21611,"Parents complaining about how violent are the games that their kids play, when there is a warning that states that ,this game is not for kids."
21612,What is the game Banned in Australia?
21613,One reason why i hate people.
21614,"I agree with the number one but the pokemon should have been a bit higher cause both of them pissed me off
And that is one of the many reason why I have an extreme dislike for most christians."
21615,"Thank go for the media, for savin' the day, and puttin' it all into perspective, in a responsible way."
21616,i think the people should stop blaming games and movies and shows for the actions of other people in the world blame the people for what they do not games and movies and tv shows i swear this shit pisses my the fuck off
21617,Hehe Wheatley @Colleen Ung
21618,"why is the media full of nothing but retards I DONT UNDERSTAND HELP US GOD MORONS ARE GIVING SO CALLED ""NEWS"""
21619,"Jack Thompson?
That Douchebag!"
21620,No Russian' definitely disturbed me when I played it.
21621,3:45 KIM!!!!!
21622,OH NO GUYS WE ARE KILLING BUNCH OF PIXELS WE ARE MURDERERS
21623,People are so stupid. There video games. FOR FUN!!!
21624,Well if people feel like the game is to violent they shouldn't bitch about they should just not buy it for there kid
21625,"People need something to get their raise, so the news blame any video game that came out that decade. Getting sad. #dontblamethegame"
21626,3.40 example of girls trying keep a cute laugh around guys. She know she wanted to laugh goofy but caught herself hahaha
21627,The massacres make me somewhat afraid to leave my home..
21628,in modern wafare the mission where u have to shoot the people at the airport u can shoot the russians and kill them but its hard
21629,All off those people are retarded they will blame Mario for mass murder if they wanted
21630,"Fun fact: the Fox News anchors, when reporting for mass effect, didn't even know you could play as a female character..."
21631,"Loved this video (as always), especially when you mentioned mass shootings and how they're always somehow related to video games. Crazy people, in my mind, will be crazy. It doesn't matter if they played video games or not, because the video games weren't the reason they were crazy in the first place. Why do you think people killed before video games? Was it because of TV, maybe even radio? Of course not.
It's just kind of pointless to blame all these tragic shootings on video games when it seems so obvious it isn't true."
21632,that hole thing opend my eyes
21633,Fox News being Fox News
21634,"Doom, satanic?, religious whack jobs lol."
21635,"No Russian isnt controversial, its thearaputic. How many other games lets you kill so many civilian NPC's with machineguns?"
21636,8:50 she knows what's up
21637,"I don't understand the whole controversy with the fallujah game... There are tons of war games out there, and many have realistic battles from real events."
21638,"peopel killing peopel before games coming out fuck dhis shyt,yea its true game industries makes more money as porn industry,dhat mental tallks is bullshit if you crazy you are crazy ."
21639,"Holy shit, most of these are making no sense whatsoever, out of context scenes and all, but the Modern Warfare 2 Massacre is pretty damn bad"
21640,kid grant for hell
21641,"FOX was not exclusively blaming mass shootings on games. In fact All major news agencies such as CNBC CNN and even BBC set out on a quest to ban games of many types around the world. The biggest hatter of violent video games is going to be running for president in two years. The second biggest is the Democratic Representative, and the third lives in the white house now and likes to force people to eat, watch, and play out side when she thinks they should. My recommendation is stop listening to all of the bend over for dollars media sources."
21642,The same can be in movies and no one gives two shits
21643,my God! the culprits of the mass shootings liked to intake oxygen and ingest water! We should ban those two items!
21644,So a game about the battle of Fallujah is controversial but a game about the WW1 and 2 is not? In both battles parents lost their child but for some reason the one is controversial and the other not. that is just bull** at best!
21645,"so wait, they're gonna ban video games instead of banning guns sold at the mall?"
21646,"so let me see, it's alright to make movies and documentaries about things that happened on war, but not video games? it's the same fucking thing but it's interactive...
there are MILLIONS (if not billions) of people playing video games, 1 kid who has mental illness goes into a school and kills everyone, and suddenly video game industry is to blame? WHAT ABOUT THE GUY THAT GAVE THAT KID THE GUN? IS HE NOT TO BLAME? i think the fact that this channel use this news to get ratings is more disgusting that Manhunt and Call of Duty! i Played both and im studying at university and i never grabbed a gun or a knife and killed anyone... FUCK ME RIGHT?"
21647,"SHUT YOUR YELLOW HONKEY NIGGA ASSSES UP! stop being sensitive there's no such thing as racism, violence, or anything for that matter it was made up so people could be treated ""special"" (slavery still bad) and complain about things they don't like. I believe in equal rights for all and think racism is just made up words used by ignorant people."
21648,"Whoever bitch and whines about how these games promotes violence, sex and all that blah blah blah nonsense needs to just simply ignore games all together.
The only reason why people do violence and such after playing video games is because they were already stupid and were prone to violence to begin with. Games should not be used as a tool to blame the actions of stupid ass people.
The only ones that I find it understandable would be the Six Days in Fallujah game. I can definitely see why people would have problems with that but that same logic goes for any first person army related games though."
21649,Some people need to chill the fuck down
21650,i clicked on this just to see if Mass Effect made the list! xD
21651,The airport one is pretty fucked up though. You can't deny that.
21652,I don't know why the media blames violence in games to real life I mean there's a pretty big difference what about the people who buys these games or leaves a loaded gun with a kid
21653,it's always foxnews
21654,"I'm not one to argue that video games cause violence, and I certainly don't advocate banning video games. that being said, the torture scene in gta 5 made me really uncomfortable, and thats coming from someone who plays violent games at least an hour or two a day."
21655,"I'm surprised to see games such as SCMRPG (Super Columbine Massacre RPG) and JFK Reloaded not on this list, actually"
21656,"Some people seem to have conveniently forgotten about how eagerly the Left's media and politicians have also been jumping on the ""blame games"" bandwagon ever since Columbine. I vividly recall a ridiculous episode of 20/20 in which Final Fantasy VII--yes, a game whose very theme was about preserving life--was one of the culprits of school violence."
21657,mgs2 bait and switch? idk lol
21658,"he said non profit esrb, they get paid. as if the government isnt involved in it, and people dont slip them money to lower the ranking on their product."
21659,"Hmmm I'm sensing a theme here: FOX can't wait to set their beady little eyes on a new prize and sink their claws in, regardless of the ""controversy"" or the ""incredibly accurate information"" they are working off of."
21660,You can't learn how to use a gun in real life from a game like COD.
21661,People are scared of fiction...
21662,"Video games can never make a person violent there's plenty of study to back that up. the only way for a video game to make a person violent is
for them to ALREADY BE INSANE.
For example Doom was blamed for the columbine shootings however according to a documentary the shooters have been picked on and they were suffering from depression. even one of the shooters was on anti depressants which apparently gave him thoughts of homicide and suicide (which made him obviously alot worse then before), all that they did was give him the same drug with a different brand name and they found that same drug in his bloodstream."
21663,What about Phatasmagoria games? Or Leisure Suit Larry?
21664,Always hate the way the media whines about videogames since they never played them yet whine over the littlest things like the adoption joke in portal surprised they dont whine about the surgery game that you lol fail to do surgery and hurt the patient
21665,"Here in canada, guns aren't readily available down the on corner. It would take a massive amount of premeditation to even succumb to the even notion of going out and killing someone because of video games. My opinion... Its not video games. It's pressure from the man and other pressing matter crossed with psych issues. Besides, mass media doesn't even cover the real tragedy going on in the world. we are incredibly censored as it is."
21666,"God i hate these ppl, games are games... idk if they realize that.....We have enough psychologists to know that doing something in a video game and doing something in real life have a HUGE gap when your about to do it, because we know in video games that we could respawn or reload a save or we need to progress. In life doing certain things give NO progression or achievement and we know its real life. For example, in games like skyrim......would we fight a real life dragon if it flew through the sky? FUCK NO!!! we would run away as fast as we could. These fucking senators and politically correct fuckers dont know that we know our power and place in video games(our limits) im not a damn ancient warrior who is prophesized to save the world......we play video games bcuz we get a chance to do or be something were not and go beyond reality for a short while"
21667,They all did shut up news i don't care ok i hate how they do this it's stupid who is goin to go and just shoot people for noreason shut up news people i hate u
21668,Wat about spec ops the line
21669,"people who blame video games for mass shootings are just being paid to protect the nra, this is basically common knowledge"
21670,"The media seems to never wanna look at the real life events in a person's life of what made them the way they were, instead they want to blame what their interests were just to have something to talk about, and the fact that their interests have nothing to do with what made them the way they were, makes want to blow up the News Stations, everytime they bring up a sorry excuse to blame video games for a person's actions, yes video games can be violent, but that's the reason why there's a rating system, and it tells you on the back of the box what is in the game, if a game has something in it I don't want my kids to see, then I'm not gonna let them see it. Point is the Media, Congress, whatever, they don't know nothing about video games, it's just a half assed attempt to take down something just because it's popular. And then a little something for number ten, women are NOT always seen as sex objects, might I remind you of Tomb Raider, the Final Fantasy series, Super Princess Peach, The Pokemon Series, Metroid, The Parasite Eve Series, Silent Hill, and the list can go on and on and on and on. Point is females are not always seen as sex objects, though some fan art would say other wise, they can be seen as a value to the story line in the game, and not just for the sex appeal. In fact, a lot of girls that play video games, wish they were the girls in the game, because of how attractive they are. (don't quote me on that, cause I could be wrong, if I am, then by all means, tear me apart)"

21673,"I hate the argument of video games cause violence. Plenty of normal people play these games and do not have issues. Someone can't just be crazy, it has to be a game or movie's fault."
21674,what game is that at 3:30
21675,People need to shut the fuck up
21676,Ever noticed that the people bitching about how violent games are to blame for people who go on murderous rampages are over 40 and have no fuckin clue to the inner workings of the human mind?
21677,"I still think it's hilariously stupid that people still blame video games for violence. Have those people ever sat down and thought about other outlying factors like parental abuse, peer-pressure, mental issues or just good old bad parenting. A lot of parents today don't want to fool with their kids and just throw them in a room with a game to shut them up. Take the time to sit down with your kid and explain to them that video games are fake and that if they play online they need to respect other players, regardless if they win or lose. Also make sure to spend time with them, it's not going to kill you."
21678,How do video games cause violence when hundreds if years ago murders where even more frequent
21679,"Massacres have been linked to shooter games since they were released. I've playing video games my whole life and when the school required a hunters ed course, I literally COULD NOT bring myself to shoot the gun. The media takes two, totally unrelated things, and puts them together trying to convince people that technology makes people insane."
21680,The people that say video games are the cause of violence or people killing people are FUCKING RETARDED!!! Pokemon is witchcraft... Give me a fucking brake. You FOX news dip shits need to get your heads out of you own asses and just SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!!!
21681,"In ""no Russian"" you don't have to shoot one shot at civilians"
21682,Mental illness is a big problem you say? Oh! That would be why money is being utilized correctly to help said persons with mental illness..wait it's not? Instead it allows people to blame everything on video games? Why that's absurd!
21683,"Heh, All these people who think they know what there talking about, makes me laugh.
Only wanting attention i see from them."
21684,I just finished Little Big Planet. I'm going to go kill some people in the mall now.
21685,"Number one is really stupid. It is really quite simple. People are refusing to see that some people have trouble seeing the lines of humanity, so they will kill anyways. The excuse that it is video games is just their way of putting the blame on something else and denying the problem. That in and of itself is the problem."
21686,I don't mean to sound like a Dick but I seriously think these people can go Fuck themselves a game is meant for enjoyment not to be argued over by a bunch of 40 year old bald losers who have nothing better to do but hitch about shit that makes them seem even more useless
21687,"Funny, most of the people complaining about these games are conservative Christians. Never mind that they were the ones who have used more racism, slavery, war crimes, rape and torture to spread their pathetic views than any video game has ever even depicted. Not even God of war could come to the sheer level of cruelty, brutality and blood spilling that these flag waving redneck pieces of shit have used to promote their fucked up religion.
Funny Puritan hypocrites.
And I may be against war myself, that doesn't mean I can't like war games, that argument was just fucking ridiculous.
And oh the hypocritical retardation of these people doesn't end there. Oh no, the conservative shitheads blame video games for these school massacres. Saying that the games tell the youngsters to take up their guns and do these horrible things.
WHILE THEY ARE THE ONES GIVING GUNS TO CHILDREN.
Gee I wonder who the real person to blame here is, a virtual character, or a rich parasite that is perfectly willing to sell machine guns and fucking sniper rifles to psychopaths, because americans are so fucking caught up in this dumb concept of ""liberty"". Pfffffffffft fucking morons.
Every time you idiots claim that banning guns wouldn't change anything, I tell you to for the love of science just LOOK OUTSIDE OF AMERICA. Look at Europe. No guns, no school shootings. Sure there is violence. But it's hardly the level of brutality that you encounter when you watch the news from the US. Your country is just filled with psychopaths. Then again, If I was living in a country where 50% still thinks dinosaurs lived alongside human beings, I'd want to have a gun at arm's reach as well."
21688,"People complaining about the ""No Russian"" level make me upset. I mean yeah, sure, you kill a bunch of civilians whilst acting like a terrorist in an airport, but big deal. Its a game! 
""Yes but this game is bad for children"" No fuck that's why its SKIPPABLE and rated M.
Sorry but that always pisses me off. Great video though,"
21689,"Before games, it was movies. Before movies, it was comics. Before comics, it was metal music, D&D, dancing, computers, punks/goth/greaser-culture... You name it.
The previous generation always blames the shit they didn't have, they don't get or that is simply new.
Next to no correlation has been found between violence and any media. I say it like that since some increase in aggression right after playing violent games has been observed in limited cases, but it's a temporary lapse outweighed by the positive impacts by a country-fucking-mile.
But the fundies need something to blame, and games are still the latest thing."
21690,"what I don't understand is why they blame viedogames for real-life violence I AM 24 YRS OLD, I'VE BEEN PLAYIN VIOLENT GAMES SINCE I WAS EIGHT! U DONT SEE ME RUNNIN AROUND KILLIN RANDOM ASS PEOPLE FOR NO GOOD REASON so government officials please STOP CRYIN ABOUT IT"
21691,News today just sickens me....how far down the hole it has gone and they let this completely ignorant unintelligent FOOLS onto their shows to spout pure nonsense. I remember that Mass Effect women....she was going on an angry tirade when CLEARLY she had never seen ANYTHING from the game what so ever. There is no actual sex scenes but merely a healthy representation of a meaningful relationship. Women portrayed as nothing but sex objects? Why is this idiot who has no idea about the game allowed to talk at all? Not only can you BE a women who is the most badass powerful person ever....but NONE of the female characters are ever damsels in distress...literally not ONE time other than when you meet Liara who then grows more than anybody in the series really. Then you got that other stupid bitch talking about logging hours? Are you fucking serious? We have studies that show video games DO NOT CAUSE PEOPLE to act violent and you have this bitch talking about it like its a FACT that they do and people should be monitored. As if the government should have some exact log somewhere of how often I play games and I should be on some kind of watch list. Yeah idiot....lets sign away more of our rights....cant see how that would become a bad idea. Fucking idiot.
21692,"Fox news seriously needs to stay away from social issues. Seriously, it's like book burning. No video game is going to make me kill people!"
21693,The one thing I love is that these news reporters blame all these games for mass shootings and have never played them! Not once have I gotten the urge to go shoot innocent people while playing a game like Gta V
21694,Fox News vs. Everyone Else
21695,"The people that think these games are controversial are way wrong. Its actually quite funny, actually. I still utterly hate PETA for their whole Pokemon scandal."
21696,"I think maybe the age at which a person is exposed to violent simulators might be a factor in these studies. I would like to know if they've studied children playing video games rated too high for their age group and how it affects their brain waves, physiological manifestations, etc. And honestly some of these games are disgusting, no matter how old you are. Who wants to shoot up a train station for fun, even in a video game?"
21697,"Games are always blamed for shootings, but this only happens in US."
21698,"number 1 ,or it could improve you arruracy in sports like paintball and airsoft"

21701,"Well there is a videogame in where you can recreate kenedis death, you are the sniper that kills him in his limousine..."
21702,"If I wanna play some fucked up killing game, I should be able to play it. Some people are just nuts. People just want something to blame because they don't like admitting that they are to blame. The blame game only makes matters worse. I wonder when people are gonna learn."
21703,Fuck Russia.
21704,"They forgot GTA Vice City when the Cubans said: ""Kill the Haitians, kill them all."""
21705,I just noticed that most of those news channels are Fox

21707,To all the congressmen and press that argue the point that video games cause violent actions: Why don't you actually pick up a controller first?
21708,Has anyone noticed that most of the press hype is Fox News?
21709,People have a tendency to look for a scapegoat when something bad happens. Way back they blamed TV for corruption of the youth and when that went out of style videogames became an easy target. Now social media is blamed a lot for things it alone cannot be the cause of.
21710,"How the American government & media minds work:
Theres people brutally harming & killing other virtual non existent people in a virtual made up world. This should not be allowed.
We're harming and killing real people in a foreign land that isn't ours, but it's totally okay because we're totally protecting people from the magical scary monsters they've got.

21711,3:28 what game is that one?
21712,OMG the news put soo many lies out to the public
21713,WHAT A LIE

21717,"Look at companies of heroes,that game takes in World war 2,you play as american soldiers,and they lose their lives,much like in real life.
And the game is not banned.And six days in fallujah? ""FUCK YOU FGT STOP MEKIN IT PPL DEID FER""
I already know World war 2 was very old,but seriously."
21718,Remember No Russian.
21719,"if the conservatives wrongly blame video games, then liberals wrongly blame guns and the 2nd amendment. it's not the games fault and it's not that guns fault. blame rests squarelyon the maniacs shouldersand no one else's"
21720,"I mostly think It's the parents fault if anything if they think violence is caused from video game violence, they don't understand it, so they think its bad. And further more if you didn't like it, don't buy it! Simple and plain but those kinds of parents are so stupid they buy it cause there kid complains or whines, then the parent complains and whines about it. Its a loping cycle of stupidity and ignorance. I have played violent video games all my life and have never ever ONCE thought of doing anything as gruesome or violent as I would see in a game to some one, why? Because I'm not some nutjob who is mentally unstable to a extent where reality and virtual reality merge. Before they say ""oh, must be them videogames that caused this"" Check them for any instances that could cause them a psychopath. Either way I think people need to stop using a scapegoat for there ""precious little one"" when its obviously not. Also if video games make people so violent, why isn't every video gamer out there doing mass murder now? Because there is no involvement and all of this is BS to begin with."
21721,whats the name off the girl at the end talking so i can thank her for atleast thinking with the fucking brain
21722,"What I find hilarious, is there is so much focus on the rating system, yet, I am assured by my own childhood gaming experience that no matter what the age is on the game or how old I am, I'm going to play it one way or another, so I can't help but feel all the media and governments attention on this is in vain."
21723,Anyone who believes video games can turn a well rounded person into a maniac should get their head checked
21724,"i do apologize, i do not mean to be racist in this case. But seeign as these all were censored around america i couldn't help it. The video games are not at fault here, the parents are (too some extent when including video games in mass murders) the reason being that when i play call of duty (mind you im old enough to understand the gravity of using weapons in the real world) the majority of the time i hear children well under the appropriate age limit yelling obscenities when they die , like ""FUCK YOU MOTHERFUKCER I'LL KILL YOU"" meaning that they are learning to take out their rage utilizing weaponry. Since they are young and impresionable this is fuckign up their heads (all of this is circumstantial i realize but you can't deny that it is true to some extent). So before the media points fingers at games, they should realize that there are other variables at play."
21725,I thought that the US gun laws had something to do with all those mass shootings. Turns out it's partly my fault for buying COD...who knew?
21726,"games dont make us violent, lag does"
21727,How is it manhunt was banned it's just video game gore
21728,"What pissed me off 
Is the news 
Correct me if I am wrong but you can buy guns right in some counties? 
Why not stop selling the firearms less people get there hands on weapon 
You see video game are the blame bc it's new to the older generation 
JUST GET USED TO IT"
21729,"A lengthy and well funded study conducted by the government of Canada showed that violent video games provide an outlet for stress.
In other words, people who play violent video games are less likely to actually be violent."
21730,watch mojo's reasoning for the tenth controversy doesn't make it right. This women in the game were simply used as sexual objects and who cares if they're boring? Thats not the point. They were seen as objects instead of people which really sets a good example for the impressionable teenagers who play video games
21731,ahaahahahah CJ is wearing pants :P
21732,fucking media video games are not the cause of violence was ww2 caused by video games huh? bitches
21733,"Still suprised Devil May Cry has not been controversial. I mean it got devils, angels, and displays the church in a bad way."
21734,"I find that blaming video games for violence is just a scapegoat for the government, and press, and even the parents. Instead of blaming the media enjoyed by millions because you think it is morally questionable, how about looking at what others could have done differently. It's always a tragedy once it happens, but after the fact so many people come out telling the press and public about the obvious signs they saw that they just ignored. This is when churches and the government and parents need to take a step back and realize that it is also up to them to help shape our moral code. I especially found it sad that 6 days in Fallujah was never released, i understand it may seem controversial, but people were just reading a book by its cover, it is possible that they meant to put a strong over-arcing message within the plot, but now the world may never know."
21735,If video games caused violence then every kid out there would be doing the same thing.
21736,"holy shit parents, religious ppl, senators, and news ppl r either really retarded or just want to blame games for their shitty problems nobody gives a shit about"
21737,"It cant possibly be the governments fault for allowing mentally ill people to have guns, it must be the fact they have video games -_- (sarcasm btw)"
21738,"These people are such pussified assholes. If they don't like the games so much, just don't buy them or play them. It's people like that that make society soft. What do they want us to do, hug trees and shit?"

21742,HAHA Doom being called Satanic.
21743,Only one thing to say. Stupid ass Republicans dont know what theyre talking about
21744,The Last woman said something about mental illnesses and I think that if someone has a mental illness they or the people who have direct contact and/or responsibilities should be aware of what type of games they play but otherwise the entire video game influencing aggression etcetera is complete and utter bullsh*t
21745,whats annoying 6 days in fallujah it was ment to be like an re enactment like a tribute but some dickhead decides that its offencive even though no ones child or brother is who lost their life in fallujah was offended
21746,"Postal 2 all the way, and God do I love that game :D"
21747,"If you follow this logic, it means that when the soldier dies, you blame the video games and not the war itself. This is so pathetic, to play games is one thing and its normal, we should even thank companies like Sony, Microsoft etc. for the innovations they made. But remember, even if you see killings on a video game, it's not a license to kill. If they should ban games that show wars, killings and massacres, they should also ban TV shows, Movies and Documentaries about wars, killings and massacres for it is in fact almost the same."
21748,"I find it funny that the vast majority of these feature the ""news"" show Fox News. Like anyone with an IQ over 50 is gonna believe them."
21749,"So yes, i do live an australia.
1. We have an r rating and x rating for movies but only recently got ratings for games. That makes no sense.
2. I'm pretty sure movies are worse than games since it's realistic ""death scenes"" and not to mention real sex with real people...
I hate old people who think they are smart and know best cause they are politicians"
21750,Awesome! At 3:47 it is Kim from the Yogscast!
21751,god people now are pussies
21752,If a person wants to kill people in real life because he could in video games its not the games' fault. That person was already f***ed up in the head
21753,How can Thrill Kill not be on this list or even mentioned!? It's the first game to ever receive an Adults Only rating and was made 9 years before Manhunt 2. Bullshit.
21754,Violence went down since video games went public
21755,I mean come on i always that games and game producer created games to do something so yeah let then do that instead being a little bitch about it and blaming a game
21756,"Oh my God, oh my god number 3 was horrifying!! The only thing that made me shocked!! What the hell goes through creator's minds when they make shit like that???"
21757,What is the game shown at 8:30 ?
21758,"This is funny because i would see the liberals blaming video game violence for mass shootings, and not the conservatives because isn't that taking away our rights as well. Plus a lot of conservatives actually play video games.
we are gamers not fucking dogs that the government can tell us what to play!!!"

21760,Micheal Atkinson.. the bane of Yahtzee's existence
21761,"It's hilarious how violent games like gta are for the blame on corrupting out youth and spreading violence. But here's the thing, it's not so much the game, as it is the parents! Those games should not be played by little kids!! And people as well as the news needs to realize that! Plus the ESRB rating system should be reworked, like having a rating in between M and T for games like say halo."
21762,im sure Donald Sterlings favorite movie was Django. should that be banned too?
21763,"it pissed me off when mass effect, a game that focuses on telling a story gets blamed and then bayonetta, a game, while fun, focuses on oversexualized combat and and character that kills angels"
21764,Stupid-ass uninformed politicians think they know what they're talking about because that's what they heard on msnbc and CNN and fox. I hate politicians.
21765,This is my opinion by the way
21766,"I think back then for modern warfare 2 it shouldn't of been done, but now looking at the gay rights in Russia, they disprove to be slaughtered because of what they are doing, Russians that help the gay rights.

21770,People just need to grow a pair.. I mean c'mon it's a video game
21771,And they said video game was only for kids....
21772,every time I see some stupid news cast video about blaming video's games for shootings I just roll my eyes and think they are morons. if anything video games help people get their violent urges out in a safe way that doesn't involve hurting any real people.
21773,Whats the game at 3:24? I keep seeing that clip and it's really bugging me that I don't know what it is :/
21774,It's always boner kill Fox news
21775,"the fallowing comment is meant to be a joke it is sarcasm
just remember guns dont kill people or mental sickness
VIDEO GAMES DO"
21776,"why can't people understand that games don't create killers, go outside and meet the gamers and get to know them personally 99% of them are really nice people that wouldn't kill anyone."
21777,That was kind of funny
21778,i would like to see how many people never play games but still kill its just people are stupid they think there so cool or something i saw my friend play games and violent at that for my whole life and he's just fine
21779,Hey
21780,"I hate these people who think that because i play video games that i am being influenced negatively. It can influence you negatively, if you have mental issues, people who are mentally and emotionally unstable should not play these, but i see no reason why i am not. This is exactly why it is called a video game; it is meant to show fictional things, some are fun, some are violent, movies are more realistically violent than games? so why aren't movies banned and not video games. I just see no point in how this will harm me. Judging from peoples ignorance, it can be beneficial, creating better ""hand-eye co-ordination"" with the Wii, or making you smarter due to puzzles or theories about the game."
21781,"Here's my opinion on the No Russian mission: who the fuck cares? Yes it's disturbing, but it's meant to be! It's meant to show the lengths fanatics are willing to go in order to incite global war, as well as the costs of terrorism. I hate when the media decides to hype these ""controversies"" up while conveniently forgetting that most people who play violent video games aren't inclined to go kill people. Killing a real person is far more difficult to do than killing a few lines of code on an emotional level."
21782,Kim laughing at anal probes LOL
21783,"Don't understand why people have to come up with the controversies, I passed through the No Russian mission without firing a single bullet at the innocent; It's a fucking video game, there is no repercussion for not firing at the civilians."
21784,I can play a ton of cod halo and any other fps and still don't want to kill anyone.
21785,"It's funny how you say conservatives tend to blame video games for real-life violence when the video game rating system was invented in 1993-94, when Democrats were in power."
21786,8:40 Pretty much sums up the thoughts against people who always blame it on video games.
21787,"Gotta laugh at some of the wowsers (especially regarding Mass Effect). BTW, I'm from Australia and can tell you that Left 4 Dead 2 and The Witcher 2 were on our shelves without any problem. Don't know where you got that from. But yes, we banned the Manhunt games. Rightly so - they concept behind them is genuinely abhorrent."
21788,"It's entirely ignorant to say No Russian was bad at all. They say that if you play that mission, you're taking the role of a terrorist. There are literally no consequences in game for playing that mission without firing a shot at the civilians. It's not forced upon you, and if you choose to shoot them, it's your decision. Don't worry about the fact that it's in the game, worry about the kids who search the whole airport making sure they got every civilian. That's where the problem is, not the people who want a good story and a good game."
21789,Freaking Americans blaming games for their failure in raising their children who become mass killers.
21790,"Lol controversy... religion... most of the time that anything goes up about controversy it comes off of the republican party and their obvious religious beliefs shrouded behind lies to pass it off as 'unjust' Simply put. dont buy it for you kids if its there. dont let your kids hear of it. If someone goes and blasts a whole neighborhood and said videogames did it, this guy is obviously off his hinges to begin with.. the news showing martys blowing a school away because they were bullied is if anything more a game changer for anyone who would want to do something like that."
21791,"Dear #, Fox News was not the only news organization that went after video games when mass shootings happen. That happened everywhere...not just Fox..."
21792,Mental Illness is a Big problem?....uhhh -_-
21793,Two words america and softies
21794,"My cousin and I hate the terrorist level from MW2 with a passion. We always skip it. I get that it's the ""jumpstart"" of World War 3, but was it really necessary to have the option to partake in it?"
21795,It's Kim from the Yogscast!
21796,Ok yeah the no russian one is FUCKED UP beyond belief. I haven't played the game but based on the video at least they make you feel bad for doing it? Idk I'm usually really against censorship but that's a bit pushing the envelope. I can't believe people think sex is more heinous than realistic violence :/
21797,"Run past me the big deal about something being satanic..... Does everything and everyone need to warship god to not be considered""evil"""
21798,8:50 i just wrote a 10 page paper on how mental illness connects with these mass shootings. There are a lot of issues there. Glad someone got it right.
21799,The one on portal 2 made me laugh because they obviously don't know the plot
21800,stupid fucking reporters
21801,"fuck the press, all they want is to make ratings so they can make dollars"
21802,"Guys, they just proved something in a study on serial killers and these mass shootings. Each and every one of the ones who committed these crimes drank water, breathed oxygen, and lived on Earth. Proven true, so if you do any of those things, you're going to be a mass shooter and kill a ton of people. ...oh, those have nothing to do with the crimes in any way shape or form and comparing the two only makes me sound like a rambling dumbass who has no clue what the hell they're talking about? Hm..."
21803,God of war is one game that has a lot of kill blood every that u can think of.
21804,i hate when people blame video games on violence that happens in real life. things exactly like this happened before video games were even a thought in someone's mind. its ridiculous how quick people are to throw blame on something they barely know anything about.
21805,"Jesus Christ media, half of the people hating sound like they've never fucking touched or seen a video game before..."
21806,"video games are the reason that causes violence?
lol was there video games back in the civil war?
also, just like the old saying of how guns dont kill people, people kill people
yet ig video games kill people
you know why people kill people? because something goes on in their head that makes them fucked up, they are phsyciotic people, not the average day human"
21807,Pacman i hate ther ghot most the blue one
21808,people need to shut the fuck up like its just a video game it barely influences people all it influences people to do is break xbox and ps3 controllers
21809,No Russian love that shit
21810,Those news reporters would hate to see what I do in Postal 2. The funny part is that none of them would even play the games to find out the truth.
21811,"wait, back up a minute... there was a news center that attacked portal for making fun of adoption; you know, not the most made fun of thing besides mothers."
21812,"this video made me have the ""Really?"" face"
21813,"God even PORTAL was bad.  I didn't even know that like I knew the characters in the game made fun of Chell, but you don't expect evil robots trying to kill you to be all rainbows and sunshine to you."
21814,"I could'nt play ""NO RUSSIANS"" in Call of Duty MW2."
21815,"These reports are so stupid. I grew up on ""violent"" video games: Mortal Kombat, Call of Duty, Spy Hunter,(running cars of the road), Wolfenstein, heck, even Zelda had violent moments if you really think about it. However it didn't cause me to go out and kill people and go on violent rampages. Because I was taught the value of life and how to respect it in the real world. In my opinion, I think the handful of kids that went on these rampages were never taught how to respect others. That's just my opinion though."
21816,To the people who think that #4 (six days in fallujah) would let people know about that war and what went on. And the news is always going to try and screw everything up.
21817,"I still don't understand. Fox broadcasts offensive stuff like Family Guy, but they think a 3 second side boob shot is totally outrageous..."
21818,It's always Fox news and it's always American media
21819,"When you blame video games for murder, you ignore the real issue; which is mental health problems. A sane person playing a video game would never dream of reenacting what they see in-game, while someone with an underlying mental illness might be influenced by it in some way (as they might by a movie or character from a book). The game isn't to blame, the failure to recognize your son/daughter/friend/brother may have a mental illness is what's to blame."
21820,Wolfenstein?
21821,"If u do them in videogames u don't then have to do it in real life. That is what the games are all about.  Its not only killing, but like nfs or sims. Money, shootting or super dangerous extreme moments what u don't want to be in real life."
21822,"I can understand some of these. But I do find it interesting (VERY interesting) that, looking back, FOX was the primary news source leading the charge against violent video games. Heck, they always focus on video games in GENERAL, saying it causes more problems than, say smoking, or drinking.
But for some people, violent video games (or games in general) give them a chance to blow off some steam (or hot air). Nothing wrong with that, so long as the person playing isn't affected by mental issues or emotional issues that could cause that switch to flip, you know (NO DISRESPECT)?"
21823,Shit I admit Mortal Kombat I was scared to play. Lol to these day I never played it
21824,"seriously, portal 2? That game has brilliant writing and it's all OBVIOUSLY tongue and cheek. (that expression is so weird)"
21825,make video games worse
21826,Parents just don't understand video games
21827,"Blaming video games and legal guns for crimes is pretty dumb to begin with. Maybe we should look at eradicating gangs when we already know who's in the top gangs and we know who's committing the crimes. Here in the US, I saw on the news that police have had peaceful talks with the top gang leaders with the police trying to convince them to commit less violent crime. It's stupid. Also, to everyone disagreeing with me and blaming guns for this, look at California, New York, and Chicago, IL where there's the strictest gun laws. They also have higher violent crime rates. In the town that I live, almost everyone that's not a criminal owns a legal gun. Guess what, there has never been a murder here and violent crime is 75% lower than the national average here."
21828,The number 1 place is right
21829,Ist person shooters don't make killing sprees. I couldn't kill a deer.
21830,"what the fuck was #1? they didnt even mention it, after the ""honorable mentions"" they went into the news and never stated what the #1 game was, or did i miss it, after rewinding 3 times."
21831,Tibia.
21832,"all i see is faux ""news"" bitching"
21833,Postal could definitely be controversial but I don't think any news stations got a hold of that one. It wasn't very popular.
21834,"the chick at the end makes a serious point
to put all the blame of a situation on video games when there are so many real society issues underlining the situation is a slap in the face to the well being of humanity."
21835,Americans over react 2 bloody everythin.And who came up wit pokmon having animal cruelty u could say the same bout any games wit pets u could stop feeding dem
21836,"One thing I wish people could understand about video games like Grand Theft Auto is that it's not just mindless violence. Grand Theft Auto tells some of the greatest stories ever told (also less violent than most criminal movies that are hailed as classics). Also, war games aren't about senselessly killing your friends and laughing about it (okay, most of them aren't), they're about the story being told; and something tells me that Six Days in Fallujah would have been a storytelling masterpiece. If it had been a movie, it would have been ""an emotional experience"", but since you'd be given control over it, it's offfensive. Personally, I think having your dead son portrayed by some overpayed actor would be more offensive than having him realistically rendered in a video game."
21837,"Some people find ways to blame something on games such as being 'satanic' or 'leads to murdering', but I won't judge them because I blame the stupidity on the news and social media the swarm over them and set them as facts when they are not"
21838,"For the GTA one, one of the clips was Saints Row -_-"
21839,I just can't watch the call of duty massacer. I almost cried
21840,"Not sure if it ever really got coverage but id be willing to bet that you could find some things about the Hitman games, especially absolution with it's high end graphics and the final scene with the little girl killing multiple people that had to have caught jackass' eye"

21843,"video gamed cause violence me: oh please do share what video games they were playing in 1066, battle of Hastings. oh an what video games they were playing in 1939 when WWII started. when the news say video games cause violence it annoys me so much"
21844,"Witchcraft, castspells, world of demonic??!! Man go back to middle age."
21845,"I have to disagree with this list a little bit. The Mortal Kombat issue was so bad at the time, people actually wanted to ban video games, and it started the video game rating system. I definitely think it should be much higher."
21846,Why was mw2 in there no russian may be a little to violent but that same thing has never happend since the begining of time i think
21847,"Video games don't make gamers violent, they are too fat and lazy to be violent."
21848,"I would say that people who are violent and like violence and what to go out and kill a load of people are better off doing virtually on a video game then in real life, also they would be attracted to violent video games because they are violent not people become violent from video games and maybe the mass shootings are because guns and ammo are to readily available in the world or most countries try stopping the guns not the video games."
21849,"Really? ""My son didn't have that choice"" yeah well nobody told your son to join the military"
21850,What people need to realize on the battle of feluja is it a motherfuckin game
21851,Night Trap is one of the hardest fucking games in the world lol
21852,What's wrong with the media? They're blaming video games instead of horrible parents.
21853,"Video games are an art form, just like any type of entertainment. Developers shouldn't allow controversy to inhibit their ability to send their message, whatever it may be. Which is a shame about that Fallujah game. I'd love to see more games made as documentaries to educate as well as entertain. Sidenote: entertain =/= cause mental pleasure."
21854,Fox News is full of retarded bullshit
21855,Reaction to top 9 was normal to religious retards. Conservative Religious people cannot enjoy everything without picketing them.
21856,My friends and I were playing MW2 for the first time and I was jealous that my friend got to play that controversial mission
21857,That last sentence by that woman at the end restored me some faith in humanity.
21858,what about postal?
21859,"Controversy number 1.
i play gears of war. theres a gun with a chainsaw on it - and i can chop you in half. stab you in the side of the body with a retro lancer and almost cut your head off.
Blow your face off with a shotgun
plant a grenade on you
and commit suicide.
i have yet to go out the door with a chainsaw or a gun. and shoot up a school or a shopping center -
and no russian? why shouldn't you, as an adult, 18 years of age or even 21 in some countries. play what the hell you like? what made that mission ""controversial"" and ridiculous was the fact that mothers complained that their 16 yr old (and younger) kid was distraught by it."
21860,Notice how the majority of the news clips are Fox...
21861,This is sad because it is all true
21862,"Putting a gun into an american hand is a bin no no. It's pretty well depicted in bowling for Columbine. The media, as always, try to shift the blame on video games."
21863,Interesting how most of the news clips are from Fox News. Hmm....
21864,"I actually get very annoyed when people claim video games cause violence, I have played video games since i was a kid, violent ones GTA, war games like BF2 and old COD games, medal of honour and games like burnout (not very violent but pretty awesome crash scenes) and Need for Speed none of these made me want a gun to kill someone with or a car to crash into to someone run away from the cops etc etc. If videos actually made people violent and do what happens in games in real life then children would be mass murderers after playing GTA or stealing cars because they did that in GTA. I bet that pretty much 99% of gamers are the same we just want to have some fun after work or school playing a game because its the same as reading a book or watching a movie. Entertainment and immersing yourself into a story."
21865,I fucking hate PETA
21866,"- ARRRRRGGG, you can kill people in videogames, then videogames are evil!... What? Easy access to weapons in our country? Well, who cares that?"
21867,"I just want to say that there is a relationship between video games and violent behavior. However, it is correlation, not causation. It could be that video games encourage violent behavior, but it could also be that violent people are more attracted to video games. Or there could be a third variable all-together that causes both. Regardless, I agree with video game defendants that it is up to the parents to control what their kids are exposed to. If you allow your 10 year old to play Grand Theft Auto, you are a bad parent. However, at the same time, you can't forget the role society plays as a whole. I can't protect my child from hearing what other kids talk about at school, which is where they learned about everything that's rated R. Either I homeschool my child and raise him in a bubble, or engage in a lifelong battle to filter society. If society as a whole encouraged better values, parenting wouldn't be so hard and exhausting. It takes a village to raise a child. The type of media out in the world is a very influential part of any child's environment. And I think it's good that we have some people who care enough to do something about it. It's much better than a ""anything goes"" mentality."
21868,I hate these people that made a big assumption about something so little.
21869,"A recent case of blaming video games was a student stabbing their teacher over here in England. They blamed GTA and RoosterTeeth. YES RoosterTeeth. The boy wore an AH hoodie and the newspapers stated that Achievement Hunter is a group of people who laugh at each other playing violent video games.THAT PISSED ME OFF, the guys at AH wouldn't harm a fly."
21870,Thank god I had normal parents who were responsible when it came to what games they let me play but not fucking retarded like these people.
21871,"When people put the blame on 1st person shooters for mass shootings or what ever it makes a person like me, a gamer at heart, very angry because the idea of a person killing people in a virtual reality is different from real life and people know that. Unless of course a person is insane, which is a given if someone does something like that. But i'm sure that now that I just got done playing some CoD Ghosts i'm going to go kill a few people.... NO!"
21872,and everyone forgets that these are just games and not reality...
21873,Kevin Mccollough would blow a fuse if he saw the witcher sex xcenes
21874,"Wow you Americans really are stupid occasionally a game gets 
Banned in Europe with one light conversation about the game
But you have to go on about it"
21875,GTA really ticked me off
21876,"In the USA you can get a gun in the same place you buy your pants, but shootings happen because of videogames.
Pretty legit to me."
21877,"Well of course these types of games are going to have a negative impact on our childrens minds. That's why they're put out there. The violence in the schools and on the streets is the side effects. And just like when they release a bad drug with terrible side effects-they blame it on the users. ""OH GEE!! IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME PRE-EXISTING CONDITION THAT NOBODY KNEW ABOUT"". ""A PSYCHOTIC BREAK"" We didn't have these problems 40+ years ago. The ratio is not congruent to the growth in population.   Their is a small group that have hijacked the media. You can see it in the garbage from hollwood movies, sitcoms, childrens programs and cartoons. Right down to pumping out all the  sludge from porn into the U.S. This same group has secured key positions in gov't. and our scools and universities. They have an agenda folks and this nation and it's peoples ""best interest"", is not part of that agenda. It would seem-our destruction-is more in liken to that agenda. Now we just need to look at and unmask those behind the curtain. 
Clue: The great and peripheral Oz. Also read about the Bolsheviks. How just a select few tore a nation apart and turned them on each other. A genocide that doubled in compare to the holocaust.  Now consider why most never heard of this tragedy yet have the holocaust drilled into our brains constantly."
21878,that call of duty mission sucked
21879,what about State of Emergency ?.
21880,5:28 what noise did he just make???
21881,Doom should have been number one.
21882,"Yes, I must say: My Magikarp taught me how to become a Satanist. Pokmon and drugs, kids. Don't do 'em all.
(Rolls eyes)"
21883,The No Russian MW2 mission was the the worst on this. It ruined MW2 entirely. Thank god you can skip it or just kill the guys shooting at you (let the real terrorists do the killing)
21884,Studies show that 100% OF SHOOTERS breathe air!! Ban it! Save our children!!
21885,"GMod was out more than 4 months ago, that's got alot of blood in it, yet no one says anything"
21886,"I find it funny when so called men of ""wisdom"" in Congress censor something that should be free to the public. If a shooting happens then it's the parents of the attacker that failed not the video game. Although I would have to admit that most of the games out there are really gore and still would have a psychological effect on people who have a (family) history of mental illness, I would have to disagree on the Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, & Saints Row, those games are for entertainment of older more mature audiences, however; the amount of little kids that cuss and speak provocative language is a sign of parents failing the new an younger generation. So attacking something that isn't the cause won't stop killings.. Bullying, Abuse, Mental Illnesses, Medication, Drugs still cause mass murders."
21887,"some people just take things way too seriously,even it wasnt violence or killings missions in any videos games.there would have still killers,crimes,or whatever bullshit you all blaming videos games for.i've been playing videos games at early age if it had to make me a victim of mental illness i should have been in jail by now,but videos games never make me kill anybody or whatever.some ppl are just sicks and play videos games this is what cause those to going crazy cuz they were sick before.dont blame videos games for how evil the world become or evil shits ppl do...its false"
21888,*Cough Counterstrike has been the blame for the last 15 years..
21889,"I don't understand the logic of anti-Six Days in Fallujah. There are already plenty of games and movie based on real wars, especially WW2. What makes Fallujah any different from games like COD? I wish Konami didn't back off and pushed it through."
21890,"Why am I not surprised that most clips with the media overreacting is Fox News? That's not news, that's propaganda. And to blame video games for mass shootings is just complete bullshit, plenty of those happened where there was no link to video games at all! It's just mentally disturbed people going crazy, video games don't cause it, to blame them is just juvenile and stupid."
21891,"Carmageddon is basically just the movie Death Race 2000 converted into a game, so why is it controversial?"
21892,What about god of war. You rip people in half and push your thumbs into Poseidon's eyes
21893,Wait I just realized the guy said Call of Duty was realistic.
21894,gta 5 torture mission?
21895,wow ... its bad effect from bad games ....

21898,I actually own the uncensored pc version. It's pretty awesome
21899,"Governments should stick to what they ""know"", economy and diplomacy. I still remember when Pokemon was ""satanic"" and banned in the middle east. Sucks that common sense and intelligence isn't a requirement to run a government..."

Guess what... still bought it HAHAHAHAH"
21901,"PS3 being modded was funny though, it also allowed me to jailbreak my ps3 and let me mode online games hah"
21902,Metal gear solid V will definitely make the next list of controversial games.
21903,"I know I should not share this, But never the less I believe it is the parents fault to try to blame a game for there kid killing, raping, getting mental illness' and a very big and immature way of thinking. most of the games that come out now are very religious or War heavy and some of them are over looked like Bayonetta I am surprised no one actually got mad what catholic preacher would not be pissed that a woman in tights is running around killing angles I mean really, but to end the comment I think people should take there own blame instead of blaming something they want to pick on"
21904,"I just got Modern Warfare 1 and 2 and when I went over to MW2 totest the multiplayer it prompted the warning for ""No Russian."" I debated and I decided that I'm going to skip it. When I first watched a play through of the level, I feltjittery from what Isaw. But that doesn't mean that I think it shouldn't have been included. It's basically going the extra mile that Rockstar always does with its games with pushing the envelope. I can take what I can in the games I play and others can with theirs."
21905,It was inevitable that the media would attempt to screw over video games the media has criticized entertainment when comic books and tv came around those were blamed for bad behavior never mind the fact that those people who did the killings were all mentally ill
21906,"More like ""engage in the most pathetic, most nerdy sex acts ever wished to be conceived."" And thats basically the only reason people like Mass Effect... Also: Violent games - bad. Tons of openly accessible and in all named aspects worse torture porn movies - nobody seems to care."
21907,"You know what's hilarious, TV 14 in America is more violent than most M rated games. XD

Breaking bad and the Walking Dead, Saw, Lost, Dexter,etc please stand up. :D"
21908,Watch mojo... All of them... I mean after all these Signtific facts that say that Video games do not increase violence... YOU THINK THEY WOULD LEARN! >:(
21909,"Notice how often Fox ""News"" appears in this. They don't let facts get in they way of them sensationalizing stories."
21910,The media overreacted for all of them except the Call of Duty one. Killing all of those innocent Russians was pretty distasteful.
21911,funny how people act considering how music is all about sex relationships and clubing. BLA BLA FUCKING BLA get what i mean.

21913,"The news story that pissed me off...... SUBWAY ARE NOT SELLING HAM OR BACON OR CHICKEN ETC BECAUSE OF MUSLIMS, not to be racist, but simply dont eat at subway if it fucking bothers you!!!"

21915,living in australia we just buy games from overseas over steam and such
21916,"People just have big problem with games theese Days.
They are so wrong!"
21917,"There is a simple solution to people who have problems with certain things in certain games, Don't play them.It's now very common to hear people say, 'I'm offended by that/ this game is offensive.' As if that gives them certain rights. It's actually nothing more... than a whine. 'I find that offensive.' It has no meaning; it has no purpose; it has no reason to be respected as a phrase. 'I am offended by that.' Well, so fucking what."
21918,thing is you can play as a woman in mass effect do these people even play the games they claim are controversial i seriously doubt it
21919,"when shooters or other violent games are to blame for rampages, then how come there happen so few killing sprees compared to the number of gamers that mostly play such games? with a little bit of thinking even politicians can come to the conclusion that there are many reasons for a rampage, but video games ain't one (or in case of mentally instable rather a minor)"
21920,"The lady at the end of this top 10, just made my night"
21921,funny how most of these people say video games are evil and they are the main ones doing damage to this country and throwing their rock and hiding their hands behind there backs.
21922,I love what that lady said at the end of the video they need to stop blaming video games and looking at the mental illness of the person.

Also Really Pokemon! witch craft potions demonic really? like if you agree with me"
21926,"I like how most adults don't care about war games that involved thousands of innocent people being killed and tortured, yet if any kind of war involves someone personal, they bombard it like it's the worst thing in the world. I know that losing someone personal sucks, but really?"
21927,"Blaming video games for violence is ridiculous but that Call of Duty ""mission"" was incredibly fucking weird. What were they thinking?"
21928,"Is it just me, or do ignorant women / radical men always put themselves at the forefront of making video games look ""evil"" or ""outrageous"". If you're old enough to go to a strip club, and those are legal and accepted by society, why can't you WATCH a sex scene in a video game? Makes no fuckin sense."
21929,how about banning guns?? oh no that would be a huge loss for the us government.....
21930,how about the call of duty where you get to assasinate fidel castro? that doesnt make your list huh
21931,I hate how people blame shootings and things on video games if you check most of the people that do shootings have a mental illness and play videogames together they are a bad combo but if there parents actually do what there supposed to and not keep guns within reach of there children this world would be fine
21932,At 5:28 What the fuck is that guy saying while she's talking?

21945,"for the record in the MW2 mission, you don't have to shoot the people."
21946,"jeez video games are not even real life so i dont get it, like how when people used to think tv soaps were real..."
21947,If video games are making people violent then I want to know what video games people have been playing over the past thousand years. Some people are just raised or maybe even born violent. The media just blames video games so they can get a story.
21948,"It doesn't surprise me that most of these ""controversies"" were covered by Faux news. :I"
21949,"I think they forgot to mention ""JFK Reloaded"", and most importantly, ""RapeLay""."
21950,Fucking stupid FOX conservatives
21951,I can't stand the press when they go on video games.
21952,These people blame it on games cause dey be mad dey don't know how to play the vidya ma game
21953,"South park the stick of truth
Ofc that was later than this movie"
21954,"The story that pisses me off the most is the kid that stabbed his spanish teacher and it was ""because he played violent video games (Dark Souls 2) and listened to heavy metal music"""
21955,"blame the games, they say"
21956,Lol. . . . . so many Fox News reports
21957,"Honestly though i think No Russian was not necessary, it could've been a cinematic..."
21958,I think rugrats should have been number 1
21959,Im sorry but the mother of the dead soldier has no reason to be interviewed. Video games are fake and you can reset. Real life is real and you die. Hard to grasp?
21960,I'm going to make a game that involves severe gory violence with plants and talks about forests being mowed down for malls..
21961,"I heard about a game a while back, where they were upset because you could assassinate presidents of the United States. I'm surprise that didn't make the list."
21962,"us Aussies got the R18 after a long debate, and now that we have it we still cant get the games, all the government has done is put the R18 in and shifted some games up but not changed any of the rules regarding what is allowed, L4D2 is still censored, and some people who aren't aussies dont know squat of whats banned over here or not, so thats always laughable i guess"
21963,No surprise that all the news clips were from FUX News
21964,Well if you ask me video games have nothing to do with people being crazy motherfuckers
21965,lol these people watch some of the yogscast?
21966,I really thought that something about the Fallout series would be in there.
21967,"I f*cking hate people who hate on us gamers and our games just because they're violent and they stupidly believe in every thing that the dumbasses at FOX say, my dad is the same way and I'm really getting sick of that disappointed look I get whenever he catches me playing games."
21968,without mortal combat there still be a rating system. and years later gamers know what you can do in a video game and what you can't do in reality
21969,"the shit about her son not coming home from the war is soooooooo stupid. ok if she's so mad at that, then how does she feel when we salute all the soldiers who come home? is she gonna say thats wrong all cuz her son didnt? is it wrong that everyone else is happy and not her? damn, its just a game that shows you how the shit was. aint nobody thinkin bout her damn son. thats what u call a selfish ass mothafucka"
21970,"On the subject of #1, I wrote an argument paper on the link between video games and violence (i.e. none) and that is bullshit. I found a Secret Service study that says schools shooters are the least likely to enjoy violence in video games compared to books,  movies, and especially their own writings. Also, if this included fan controversies, I would say include ME3's original endings."
21971,"I'm done with the news media, everyone on there seems so biased and ignorant."
21972,What is the game at 3:25 and 3:31 ?
21973,F*cking anti-video game d*ckheads.
21974,How about the ARMA 3 developer imprisonment?
21975,"News ""presenters"" in America are the most annoying fuckheads on the planet. They act so self righteous and ""goody goody."" Take them away from the camera and they will be participating in everything they condemn. Fuck them."
21976,I was meant to put realise
21977,Only in America do the shootings do they they let everyone have a gun
21978,"Fuck that, Games are games. they cant blame games for what happen in real life. Fuck you news people and people who dont like playing violence games."
21979,funny how its always fox and friends that do these game controversies now and say ban video gamesevery time there's acrime involving someone who plays video gamesmakes me wonder how gamers can possibly be conservative at all in America these days
21980,carmageddon?
21981,Postal 2
21982,"Manhunt 2 is now on Gamersgate or Amazon for purchase again, fully uncut"
21983,"None of those games are banned in Australia...
Australia is probably one of the more easy going with controversy..."
21984,he new R 18+ game rating is bovine excrement.
21985,these people make e wan to have a lobotomy.
21986,I knew Mortal Kombat would make this list.
21987,I'm tired of them blaming everything on games its not the games its the parents I've never heard of someone killing someone else because he saw it in a game but I have heard of a kid killing someone else because that kid was being neglected
21988,I hate the press when it comes to video games
21989,Fuck Atkinson
21990,"Wow... these controversies are practically gonna save lives... only, there's one problem... THESE CONTROVERSIES ARE BULLSHIT BECAUSE THESE ARE ALL JUST VIDEO GAMES!!!"
21991,"The US should stop blaming video games for gun violence, maybe they should consider re-examining their gun laws. Statistically owners of handguns are more likely to be shot with their own gun, they're also more likely to shoot someone who they actually know.
I live in Northern Ireland, a country that was rampant with terrorism and is still home to small terrorist factions. Of all the things I worry might happen to me when I leave the house, getting shot isn't one of them..
Furthermore video games are like all media, in order to be affected by them there need to be something wrong with you in the 1st place. I've been a gamer since I was about 12, I'm in my late 20's now and I haven't killed anyone in real life."
21992,Leave it to the Black woman on the Canadian news show too talk the most sense out of all of 'em
21993,Im so fucking sick of the news now
21994,Uh the Witcher 2 was allowed to be sold in Australia..and it was uncensored
21995,cool list! <3
21996,"To this day I dont know why ""No Russian"" got so much heat. For one you dont even have to shoot the civilians. Secondly, even if you do, how is it any different than your typical Grand Theft Auto rampage?"
21997,People say that video games make you violent. I say not having my video games is making me pretty fucking violent!
21998,Yogscast kim....Anyone?
21999,People are such crybabies these days. People need to grow up.
22000,"omg video games are supposed to be fun, not hated"
22001,8:22 SMACKDOWN
22002,6:32 is that laurence fishburne getting stabbed
22003,They are all bullshit games are games nothing else
22004,So if GTA  turns me into a murder then dose goat simulator turn me into a goat?
22005,OK guys. WHY THE F**K IS POKEMON SATINIC?! I'm Christian and all I see is a child questing to become the Pokemon Master. Linking that to witchcraft is such bullshit and was just done for attention.
22006,manhunt1 and 2 are horrible games they are super extra bloody i watched videos it was about sneaking but not like other games of sneaking its so bloody! if that game wouldnt exist i would be happier
22007,"I love how you get 2-3 warning before playing ""No Russian"" and half the people talking about it have never picked up a controller and played an FPS in there whole life those are the people that should die but no all the smart and great people have to die"
22008,"4:35 ""Funding from punani""?"
22009,"Man, i fucking hate people who rant about video games not teaching you about anything positive. I learned some things that i would have never learned in real life. I also learned English in the video games."
22010,"Nobody cares, middle-aged white people. Nobody cares."
22011,Is it bad that the 'No Russian' mission was one of my favourtie ones in MW2? .. Sorry. But I like killing innocent people in games. /.\ It's just so cruel and evil. Never in RL though pwomise.^^ And I love L4D2. And I hate that stupid old game where you can rape the little indian woman. That is wrong on so many levels.
22012,oh fox news you bloody hate video games
22013,really? the Pokmon thing? I have Christian beliefs it does not teach witchcraft or sorcery I don't know where that came from. I did hear about what happen to those Japanese kids not demonic possession but a medical condition
22014,"almost all of those based on lies and promoted by republican propaganda and fear mongering, sounds about right since fear-mongering is all the bigots are good for anyway"
22015,I hate the press and gossip type shows that talk sh!t about games when all they do is say everything makes you a f***ing terrorist or serial killer
22016,"MANHUNT was the shit back in it's day aahh, the memories..."
22017,I knew number 3 was coming from the start of the video XD
22018,"I agree that the No Russian mission wasn't necessary to play, could've just showed you a cutscene instead of saying ""Here! You can be the terrorist!"", but in reality these games don't take much too far. Pretty much, if your old enough to do something legally (Mass Effect sex scenes) or to watch real actors perform it with special effects in movies, why can't people old enough to buy the game (since only 18 year olds can buy most of these games) play it without ""Being at risk of becoming an ultra-violent terrorist or serial killer""?"
22019,Good gawd FOX leave us gamers alone
22020,Lol aus gets all those games they said we didn't
22021,Surprised Resident Evil 5 wasn't in here. Because apparently it is racist for a spec ops agent to shoot zombies if the zombies happen to be black and he happens to be white
22022,"I'll admit, GTA is such an unnecessarily crass game, uncultured gaming at its finest. And I'll admit I was extremely unsettled by the MW2 civilian massacring. There was absolutely no reason for that to be the way it was and it was indeed a step too far. So unlike some gamers I believe their is a point where you have gone too far but stuff like Mortal Kombat being too violent is just ridiculous."
22023,I loved manhunt series... very solid games.
22024,I HATE how people blame CoD and all the other FPS for people killing in real life
22025,"People need to understand that a video game is a video game, It allows people to escape the real world and blow off some steam and have fun, Howeverpeople think its the video games that make people do these things. Video games do not but a real gun in your hand and pull the trigger, Everyone has a choice you do it everyday, If someone wants to shoot someone or murder them, Its there choice it has nothing to do with video games, I have been playing 18+ games since I was a young age, And I grew up just fine because I knew the difference between right and wrong. People just need to pull there heads out of there ass."
22026,someone at watchmojo has a big chubby for night trap.
22027,oh common
22028,"Oh no i can choose to shoot theese civilians in a game i have to be 18 to buy, oh nooo now im gonna pee my pants and shoot some real people, because thats how it works... I just dont get it. If ""we"" are so fast to pick up on anything that we see in games, why dont they use it for education, lets do math in some school vidio games, and we will probably go do ""real"" math. It dosent work that way, c'mon."
22029,"Mass Effect -shows a little side boob, 1 minute long,requires you to beat the 60 hour game to get to it, requires you to be 18 to the buy the game AKA old enough to be fucking others yourself.
Watching a real girl getting fucked by 7 dicks at once -takes 2 minutes on the internet, requires no pay wall or age verification.
6 days in Fallujah- told to fuckoff by the media whilst it was commissioned and requested by the poor soldiers themselves who were actually in the battle.
News casts FUCK YOU your a bunch of ignorant shits who are talking about making money off of sex and war when you make up stories, exploit humans choices andcelebrity lives, andACTUALY MAKE MONEY OFF OF SEX AND WAR."
22030,i usually replay that no Russian mission when i need to blow off some steam....so...ya suck it fox news!! muahahahahahaha!!
22031,"Charles Manson organized the Tate-LaBianca murders because he thought the Beatles song ""Helter Skelter"" predicted a race-war that he was destined to kick off. Mark David Chapman murdered John Lennon after reading ""The Catcher in the Rye"". And the Reagan assassination attempt was all because the nutball gunman had a crush on Jodie Foster and thought it was the best way to get her attention.
Point is...if your kid is a nut, he or she could be set off by ANYTHING. Instead of being their friend and covering up any emotional problems, these parents need to grow a set and actually PARENT their kids....and that involves seeking professional help if a situation in the child's behavior arises."
22032,That No Russian mission is really horrific.
22033,100% of criminals have admitted to drinking water.
22034,I really am suprised GTA f***ing hookers for health wasn't mentioned lol.
22035,No not lfd2
22036,"The ""No Russians"" mission, eh? A realistic and brutal massacre on innocent civilians at a Russian Airport. What kind of mindless bullshit is this?! No wonder why I continue to hate humans. Humans are driven with hatred. This just might as well happen in reality."
22037,"If you can't tell the difference between a game and reality, then you are mentally ill and shouldn't be playing violent games in the first place. That's the responsibility of the parents to keep their children away from them and get them psychiatric help. Sane people can play a game where you do the most horrible things and know that they will never even think about doing it in reality. I can play professional sports games all day but I sure as hell ain't going to be trying out for the NBA in this lifetime. Blaming video games for violent behavior is a load of shit."
22038,What did they pick for #1
22039,"Blah blah blah bullcrap.
you know watching fox news make you stupid its a fact look it up"
22040,"What really bothers me is when a super influential pastor tries to say pokemon is demonic or introduces children to witchcraft, I am a Christian myself but these pastors really are making huge assumptions, honestly yu gi oh(because summoning and ritual cards) and harry potter(obvious magic) have more warrant for those claims but I still feel those are harmless enough as works of fantasy, however I will also say that actually trying to preform magic or do voodoo rituals is in my belief evil, but pokemon has no instructions to preform witch craft what so ever and pokemon have natural abilities and powers not spell casting anyways, saying charizard is a fire witch i guess the human torch is too.
Okay rant over just bothers me when my own religions leaders show ignorance and non acceptance as people freak out when they here im a Christian who plays pokemon and ask unneeded questions"
22041,God the media is so fucking retarded
22042,"I think the little girl getting blown up by a van in MW3 is a little more disturbing then ""No Russian"" but thats just me."
22043,Pokemon taught me how to do witchcraft! I now know how to cast spells without even knowing I could.
22044,Now the no Russian mission shouldn't have been a big deal they literally gave the option to skip it yes they should have not gave a shit level of 100 but still they should have played the game first and wait for that pop up that blocks the mission
22045,"The problem as to why these games were banned is due to the fact that our Government treats us like children, and not adults. This is why I am all for smaller Government."
22046,"You dont like the game, you dont like the story? Then get the fuck out, that's for the people that are always demanding this types of game's o3o"
22047,"The funniest thing is that Youth violent crime rate in the West is at an all time low. I once wrote a paper in college that suggested that the best crime deterrent that the State could implement was to give every child a free Playstation or Xbox.
Shocking...but more crimes are committed when teens are outside as opposed to when they are inside. Also, Japan plays a shockingly large amount of video games, and Japan's crime rate is also shockingly low."
22048,"Buuuuuuuut the Hot Coffee wasn't in the game, it was just a mod."
22049,OMFG a man deciding how many women he wants to sleep with !!! thats sacraligue !!!!!! only women can fuck a hundred men of there choosing not the other way arouind !
22050,I'd say the number 1 controversies is the wars and nuclear.
22051,"I have to admit watching that ""no russian"" clip was pretty unnerving. I don't remember being that bugged about it when I originally played it myself. Although that was almost 5 years ago"
22052,I wonder if I jumped on a turtle would they start blaming mario......
22053,Notice how FOX news is the base of most of the controversies.
22054,"there are more important things to worry about in this violent, corrupt, and theivingcountry than video games. if u dont aggree with the game, dont fuckin buy it."
22055,If parents or anyone is blaming a bad game for their child's mental problems their child is usually the one at fault in my opinion. Games that are rated M should be enough to warn that kids shouldn't play them.
22056,"The religious BS always gets me. I mean, it's Pokemon, a fantasy game. One in which at least children can tell it's a fantasy, yet there are adults who will believe it's real or teaches mystical powers."
22057,"You know what the real cause of these mass shootings in the US are caused by? (I'm not saying it doesn't happen in other countries, but most happen over there) The complete lack of gun control. The strict gun laws have worked in other countries, so why shouldn't it work in the US?"
22058,Is it evil that I only played MW2's campaign just for that one mission?
22059,Fox news SMFH
22060,I had a feeling No Russian would be here.
22061,When I played the mission in cod modern warfare I didn't shoot the people
22062,Old white people getting their panties in bunches. Ignorant fucks..
22063,really its always the mass shooting blame video games that really make me mad because they're just blaming games as a pillow because they can 't figure it out themselves why so the first thing is to blame shooter games or violent video games.
22064,Top 10 Fox News getting mad at Video Games moments
22065,"I remember that no russian mission, i was actually shocked on what to do"
22066,Ok I really hate the pokemon controversy because that preacher didn't get his facts strate and it ruined pokemon for alot of kids
22067,I think that the news channels and all those people should just stfu and let people play.
22068,I'm 13 now...I played MW2 when I was 10 I played no Russian completed it the  never touched it again... Pokemon thing is about as logical as god is real... IT NOT FUCKING SAITANIC AND PETA ARE JUST BITCHES
22069,"Fox news... The bane of everything. Full of nothing but greedy, egotistical, dumbasses"
22070,The mass effect one pissed me off so damn much! It was obvious the 2 people didn't know what they were talking about! Of course that's what I've come to expect from Fox News.
22071,"Hey! I play tennis on wii but I am not a pro in real life and I play Forza motorsports but I can not drive like that in real life but when I play Call of Duty, GTA or Battlefield I am a fucking cold killer IN REAL LIFE... What is wrong with people??"
22072,"i loved call of duty but its kind of racist cuz i loved russian people, And even the nazi came fom russia, but other rassian people has goodness in there heart. Even them other russian jew was killed too i feel bad forsaying this things............"
22073,6 days in Fallujah [*]
22074,Now i want that game manhunt
22075,"I am an anti-anti videogame person. They are a way to let off steam. If you say I WANNA KILL SOMEBODY, hop on that ps3/4/2/whatever and play!"
22076,"LOL at all the ones ""complaining"" was FOX NEWS CHANNEL."
22077,ITS A GAME NOT REAL LIFE!!!
22078,To me
22079,Its too late. Im already psychologically damaged. hahahahahahaha
22080,Those sissies don't buy the the game if you don't like it!!
22081,"Fuckoff, Fox news. Only redneck Americans watch you, and entertaining the most culturally retarded people in the world is nothing to be proud of. (Note, I specified REDNECK Americans. If you are American, but do not consider yourself a redneck and don't enjoy Fox news, then this does not include you.)"
22082,"I don't know man, there was violence before video games were a thing, how do we explain that?"
22083,Seriously......PETA takes it way too far and I'm a vegetarian. Really accusing Pokemon of condoning animal abuse? They're made up creatures lol.
22084,"People are so fucking stupid, especiallythe news"
22085,"and the ps network wasnt hacked it was the 3rd party pay site that got hacked , thats why sony now regulates the paying, b4 you had to call the 3rd party site if you had a complaint now you call sony direct"
22086,... Am I the only one that would actually enjoy the PETA version of Pokemon?
22087,People who blame video games for murder are foolish dumbasses. THEY ARE ALL MENTALLY INSANE.
22088,"Have to blame it all on video games... just like they blame it all on violent horror movies from the 1970s, 1980s and so on, ugh. Conservatives have to blame it all on that! it's so damn annoying at times and that's why i'm in the non-party candidacy."
22089,portal 2?!?!... what the...
22090,The news one is just stupid. I've been playing violent video games since I was 10. 7 years I've been playing games like left 4 dead GTA cod halo and not once have thought my neighbours need to die or I need to kill something its ridiculous
22091,"people like violent video games, get over it"
22092,"I like that woman at the end, basically stating that people with a mental illness should be more careful as they could suseptable, blaming the game company is just stupid, they put warnings of the content on the packaging, not their fault if you buy it for someone that can't handle it"
22093,it is obvious that 1st person shooters are not to blame  i play them for hours every week and im not a psycopath. that shooter had a mental illness and probably played the games to simulate the shooting of people
22094,"sure, the problem are the videogames when a psicopath kills, not the easy acces to guns..."
22095,Its funny how its always on fox news. Im not even american and i knowabout that place of distorted reality.
22096,dude what about State of Emergency?
22097,"A kid who plays a game like battlefield or call of duty won't all of the sudden turn into a crazy maniac, only kids who already had a mental illness might get a little crazy. also if you look at the people who do these shootings, not all of them played video games, most of them were just weird and crazy."
22098,what about postal 2? that game is sick :)
22099,Shut up fox seriously
22100,"How bout stop blaming games on crimes and just be a parent already! It's a GAME, what's next, you're gonna blame runaways on on hide-and-go seek"
22101,What about the Postal series.
22102,So i can continue the mission alone without any dead civillians.
22103,"I refused to kill any civillians at mw2 and even at the start of the mission at the first time i was trying to kill the other terrorists leading to ""friendly fire is not tolarated""."
22104,the games are for people not to be bored and i understand that some have disturbing scenes but its your fault for buying the game no the makers. the pokemon one in my opinion should not have been made as its weird and creepy but its the company choice. anther thing is why are gory 1st person shooters or 3rd person always to blame its the parents fault for buying it for their kids thats why there is a age rating in red. i wonder if that new game that came out will be Fd up by people with nothing better to do than ruin gaming for everyone
22105,"People were violent in WWI and WWII. It must be because of video games they played. Accept there were no video games back then assholes!
That is why we had Nazis and the Bush administration. All because of intolerant, ignorant, fearful,stupid and violent assholes like the guys at fox news and associates."
22106,"You guys should make a top ten list of Deconstruction games. Games that created a new experience and elements by criticizing tropes, themes, cliches and aspects of video games or other things in this world. Besides limiting to only one game in a series to prevent stacking, you should also limit to only one game in the genre that it deconstructs, unless if the game deconstructs more than one thing. I am expecting Spec Ops: The Line (deconstructs how war and killing is shown in video games) and School Days (deconstructs the harem and eroge genre of video games) in that list."
22107,I wish people would just stop bitching with games because THERE JUST ****ING GAMES
22108,No Russian was a good mission
22109,Video games don't make people violent it's the people with mental problems that are made violent if they play the games.
22110,LOL
22111,"Really don't like how the media thinks about video games, if I get more violent because of shooter games, then I guess I become a good farmer when I play farmville. :/"
22112,I just love how the news is gonna sit there and bitch about it because its like south park no one sues them cuz they know theyre gonna lose and all these storys are false bullshit cuz you know games are the blame for everything
22113,"What do almost all of these controversies have in common? Fox News. Notice the same 2 men and woman show up in almost every single one of these. They are the ones that are the most damaging. Not to video games but as media in general. Fox and friends is a program on Fox news where 3 people (the 2 men and woman) sit and talk about stuff and its always knee jerk reactionary to everything. And as if thats not bad enough any dissenting views that challenge theirs is quickly shut down and called ""liberal propaganda"" Sane people laugh at the utter stupidity of it.... Until we remember how many people watch them and take it to heart."
22114,"That preacher guy talking about pokemon made me cringe so badly. I love how people only look for something to blame without knowing shit about their scapegoat. ""Pokemon teaches kids witchcraft, magic and satanism!"" RRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT because a game about10 year old going around taming animals to achieve the goal of being a champion of his region is TOTALLY what Satan is using to corrupt the world. /)_-"
22115,"I love how every story was by Fox News, i find that hilarious"
22116,"I also love that the main ""issue"" with GTA San Andreas was the sex thing, and not the killing.
Sex and dirty language is way worse than violence. OK."
22117,"That last lady is the only person who actually gets it. The US government & the news (which is just a bastardized quest for ratings) love pointing the finger at games, music, TV, guns, &c.. Mental health is an enormous issue in Western society. That's the real problem. It's only too easy to blame something that one doesn't need to know anything about."
22118,"Please, watching Fox News is intellectually damaging"
22119,What's the name of the music
22120,Whats wrong with No Russian mission in CoD ? thats my favourite mission in the game
22121,"Fuck Faux news, they're one big joke."
22122,I am never moving to or visiting Australia
22123,Violent games turn people into mass murderers? Bollocks. I watch Coronation Street and I don't feel like a pedophile.
22124,The outrage against violence in video games is evidence that there are too many weaklings in our society.
22125,"The news reporter on ME sex scenes... god she's retarded! There are sex scenes with men, and you can play as a girl... fucktard"
22126,There has always been sex and violence in entertainment. Many of the plays by William Shakespeare had far more of both than what is found in contemporary video games.
22127,"Oh wow your kid died in a war? So did every fucking body else's kid. They're not giving out specific names, they're not showing YOUR kid dying. I know it's not the best idea and I understand why people might not like it but don't on a live news cast corner a man and make him feel like shit when he didn't do anything wrong."
22128,people are so stupid...
22129,"Those damn republicans and super religious people!!! They blame everything violent in society on video games. The games have a rating for a reason. Yet the parents still buy them for their kids who are too young for game rating and when said kids do something violent the games are blamed. If the parents actually paid attention to the ratings, there might not be as many school shootings. As for the super religious conservative people and games being demonic, we'll they seem to believe that anything not Christian is evil."

22132,"unleashing our minds in video games, and unleashing our anger and our violent sides is what keeps us sane. Its a stress reliever. Yet if we are kept from it in a real situation we are more likely to panic, more likely to snap, more likely to have that bottled up rage that we cant let out by shooting someone in a game. Its healthy to be able to do such a thing and prepares us for the cruel things that really do exist in the world."
22133,"I used to play GTA 3 on the PC with my dad when I was a little kid. Despite trying to run over every single person I could and getting five stars, I never grew up to be a violent teenager who's ready to kill my classmates. These allegations of violent games creating murderers are ridiculous."
22134,"I used to work at gamestop where parents of 6-10year old kids buy the m-rated games for them and I would tell them(parents) what was in the game content, and the parent would brush it off and allow the kid to play the games for hours on end. So I wouldn't blame the games I blame those parent that blames someone/something else when they are the major reason why."

22138,"Some people argue that violent games are good because it helps the player get out their anger and such. Since it would be out, they'll be more likely to control their temper and NOT go on a killing spree if they do lose it. - This is just what others have said. How many people agree or disagree?"
22139,"I love all these so called ""experts"" talking badly about something they have no clue about. They have zero passion for what they are speaking for. There was recently a politician in California I believe who was against violence and guns in games and he was caught smuggling guns."

22141,"I'm from Australia and I think its fucking stupid to censor things made to be purchased by adults. If it is on;y allowed to be purchased by somebody over 18, gamers should have the right to play them totally UNCUT.

22143,"Video Games are ment for Fun. you can never never ever compare a Digital world to real life. If the games are to violent, they get a M rating. That's there for a reason saying Hey this is bloody violent, Crude language, and disturbing images. The Makers of the game cannot stop the parents of a 13 year old child from buying a M rated game for them.For those who bag on game like that or any game. why not play it for yourself see what the hub bub is about, you just might like the game. If the game wasnt fun or was a flop no one buys it. but if its fun and has a good plot people buy it."

22154,"THIS PISSES ME OFF SO FUCKING MUCH! I'm a psychologist and because a person plays video games does not make them violent. Saying I'm going to be a murderer because I play COD is like saying I'm going to be a suicide bomber because I'm muslim. Some terrorists are muslims and some violent people play violent video games but the percentage is so small it's barely significant but the media jump up and down on it based on poor science and studies based on poor science which are carefully selected to make their point. They're generating numbers and ignoring others to support whatever the fuck they like. I can gather evidence saying that eating ice cream increases the likelihood of death so you shouldn't eat it but I neglect to mention the fact it's fucking summer and more people die of heat exhaustion and drowning and not because they had too much Ben and Jerry's. If people think that the games are inappropriate due to violence or sexual content and that they should be banned go to fucking hollywood and stop them producing zombie films, serial killer movies or movies that have a sexual nature. Jesus fucking Christ rant over"
22155,"The 6 Days in Fallujah, I can understand. I have nothing against a game that tells the story of something that our troops went through, but I think more than anything. it would have to be the timing of it. There has been little or no controversy surrounding games depicting events in WWII or Vietnam simply because most of the family members that were affected by those lost in war aren't around.
As for the argument about violent video games: I believe that parents should monitor what their kids play. That's not to say that violent video games makes people do bad things. However, there are some people that need to be firmly grounded in reality before playing the real violent games, because they have almost no perception of what's real or what isn't. Unlike like a video game, a human life can't be reset."

22170,"I find it amusing that people use violent video games as scapegoats...especially when you look up CoD meltdowns here on Youtube, and you find a lot of them are 12 year-olds screaming and cursing at people. If the parents are too lazy to be parents, and let their kids play games that aren't meant for them, then they should be held culpable for their child's actions. Their ineffectiveness as a parent partially correlates to the fact that their child cannot distinguish the line between fantasy and reality. The other contributing factor is a deep-seated psychological problem, stemming from a chemical imbalance."
22171,"8:40 was the only smart thing that has been said this entire video by tv personnel. Movies and games are not responsible for people killing, it is because those people have issues in their head."
22172,"games are never psychologically damaging it is only people that are already psychologically damaged and video games get the bad wrap for it. Might as well get rid of movies too or tv shows, or even music. Plus they already have ratings on them how much more clear do they have to be? If a game is rated mature you can be damn sure there is mature content in there. A movie rated R or 18a is going to be explicit and violent and sexual. People have no right to complain about what they view when they are the ones making the choice to view it."
22173,"Problem - Kids are getting their hands on games despite the ESRB's efforts.
Method - Kids throw a tantrum when parents say no.
Solution - Kid busts out a tantrum, you bust their ass with a belt and go home.
Scapegoat - Blame the foreseen violence on the game, instead of your parenting."

22181,"Okay, banningSix Days in Fallujah has got to be the dumbest reason! Sure, many soldiers lost their lives, but I'm sure the game developers didn't make the game JUST to joke about the event!!
Hell, you don't see that shit in movies! There have been MANY military movies like Act of Valor, and I don't see people making controversies to that!
Americans these days are so goddamn sensitive... -_-"
22182,Mass Effect? Really?
22183,man I hate #1 on this list if your has any seriously mental problems don't let them play rated M games
22184,acctualy mannhunt 2 is still available here in mexico
22185,People should stop linking video games and real live. They're not real! Gamers are smart enough to see they have only one live and if they fuck up there's no restart. Realistic games I can kinda understand but pokemon? Really? Everything can be seen as animal abuse or racism nowadays! Next they'll say something like viva piata makes children think that animals like to be hit with a stick.
22186,The PETA pokemon games and the whole video game violence causes real violence angers me.
22187,I just don't understand people now days. So its okay to watch a violent movie but its not okay to play a violent video game? Like most people on the comment section. Don't play or buy the game if you're not into that. There is a purpose to the rating system. Video games don't make you a violent psychopath or spark the fuel to go out and do something regretful. Parents should pay attention to their kids and thats that. I've seen parents buy their young spoiled kids Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto. Yeah I know kids will be kids but parents should blame themselves first before they blame the media but I guess they find it easier to point the finger.
22188,"You have to be REALLY fucking stupid to believe video games are one of the causes of mass shooting. Ironically enough, the two primary groups of people who think like that are also the one that frequently start problems on the globe.... Politicians and religious fools."

22194,god dammit no offence but the us media always blames guns and shit on tv and games....WHY DONT THEY JUST BAN HOUSEHOLDS FROM HAVING GUNS IN THE FIRST PLACE...instead of blaming it on other things
22195,there are the reason why they making it violence letting people buy guns -.- y dont people who is guarding something like police or bodyguard -.-
22196,"Also, you don't want people to shoot people? CONTROL YOUR GODDAMN GUNS AMERICA."

22207,"Games don't kill people as much as other things do- everything can be blamed and in the event of a tragedy blaming something helps with the coping process. That would be fine if not for the fact that these events are hurting the sales of video games and other forms of media. I play games and don't kill people, but this one guy killed a bunch of people and played games so it means that video games are bad right?
Then so is everything else that is a common element with people."
22208,"are people today so stupid they cant understand games are just some coding ? not a real thin? why are we so concerned about a person getting shot in a virtual world and not a about what is really going on like whats happening in Ukraine, species going extinct, poverty everywhere, and the fact were killing ourselves?"
22209,God damn news always blaming video games for shootings. It's not the game it's a person who needs help. Instead of blaming games blame the person.
22210,"Manhunt is what it is. If people don't like hunting down people, then obviously don't buy a game called 'Manhunt' the clues in the title. And if you lost a family member in the war and you are sensitive about that area, then don't buy an army game. Simple. -_-"
22211,8:30 I've got that game for the Wii! :D
22212,i play video games and listen to Metal. fear my fat ass...lol
22213,"If you think about it everyone against game violence are really big hypocrites. People serve under a flag won by a bloody revolution. We eat tens of thoundsounds of animal flesh every year, we go past fields where natives used to live centuries ago. A video game you can turn off. Real life you can't, so why are they complaining. Video games were't really a thing untill the late 60's early 70's so what about before then? Oh WWI and WWII were because of a video game, Vietnam war was because of a video game? Hell plots in books/movies based on true events like The Outsiders and Jackie Robinson was the violence in that related to games? No! Jease people just try to find a excuse for anything now."
22214,"Wow some people need to chill out. There's absolutely nothing realistic about the violence portrayed in video games and movies. Doesn't matter how violent games or movies are, it's all fake. I mean for god's sake, video games are just cool looking animations. I'm a gorehound and a hardcore lover of disturbing horror films, but I cringe and look away at terrible sports injuries way more than when I watch films like Braindead, A Serbian Film, Melancholie Der Engel. That's because horrific sports injuries are real, games and movies are not. People only blame violent video games for tragic shootings and whatnot because it's easy for them to. It's easier to lay the blame of someone's violent behavior on games than it is to accept that there are people out there who are truly evil and sick."
22215,"#4 If a game can be hated out of existence for being based on events where people died, why are there so many WWII games around?"

22220,"Sooo, I play very violent video games. I did that airport terrorist level in COD. Didn't make me want to go out to an airport and do it. Nor did GTA or any of those other games. Those sex scenes are a controversy???? Really? Cause nobody knows what sex is, and it is totally immoral. I don't think it portrays women negatively. Hell there are plenty of girls who use sex as it is to get what they want. But everyone knows girls don't do that. They are so proper, they don't even fart. And whats wrong with war based games? So we hide those too? And what, make it like it never happened? The press and government are such pussies. Grow the fuck up. My cousin served in the war, and lost good men, but he still plays war games. Trying to get games banned won't work. We will still play them, or find a way to get them. COD and GTA are a huge franchise. You couldn't get them tossed if you tried. And if you managed to, the uproar would be catastrophic. Grow up and let us live. It's not like this world was fucked up before video games were even thought of....."
22221,"Let me tell you a story about the immediate aftermath of the Sandy Hook massacre. If you don't already know it, in December 2012, Adam Lanza shot 20 students and faculty at Sandy Hook elementary. However, directly after it, authorities believed that Adam's brother Ryan was the perpetrator. After some people checked his Facebook, word got out that he had liked Mass Effect. So then the media went all out on Mass Effect, dubbing them 'child killers', and such. But after they found out it was his brother Adam who did it, they looked at his Facebook and found that the only video games he liked were Starcraft and Dance Dance Revolution. Thankfully, they could not tie either of these games to shooting or sting violence, they instead blamed Adam's various mental issues. If mental issues were looked into more on incidents like Columbine, people could actually find ways to better understand and even prevent mass shootings, instead of blaming the wrong people."
22222,5:25 what a bitch
22223,"this is rubbish, I played all these games and I only kill one person every month"
22224,"I remember I made a argument in my speech and debate class over video games and violence. And this was around the time people were in a uproar over Mortal Kombat. I have, and will always have this perspective. And people may argue freely over it, its stated in brevity so forgive me for not going in depth. Media violence does not make someone violent in real life, that's a choice they make. And is in no way shape or form related. If people find relation or state relation, its simply an excuse. People do what they do because they can."
22225,What ever the meadia can get its dirty long fingers into it will. And I really makes me angery that PEOEPL BLAME GUNS NOT TO THE PEOPLE WEILDING THE GUNS. Every one is so sensitive to killings and other real world events. It makes me sick. K I'm done bye
22226,"On that last controversy, I think it is both overstated on one side, and underestimated on the other. I have seen that kids who play too many violent video games do act more aggressive and angry. While it is true it is unlikely that most of them will ever actually commit an act of murder, mass or no, I don't think it can or should be ruled out in existing cases. All of these mass shooters have some things in common: They are unstable and they are cowards, and an astonishing number of them had previously fit into the same category that many of this country's most avid gamers fit into.
I probably won't allow my future kids to play the most violent of video games (certainly nothing rated M and I will personally smash their game system if I ever caught them playing something like GTA or Manhunt. Those games are truly sick and twisted).
Instead I'll teach them to hunt and fish and play baseball and how to respect people and the sanctity of life.
Oh, and for those of you down there in the comments trying to place the blame of those shootings on guns: You. Are. Ignorant. Stop trying to make Americans defenseless against criminals, tyrants, and other enemies."
22227,Im surprised there wasn't much on the counter strike series
22228,"Such arrogant ass-holes. Just video games there for entertainment pure and fucking simple! I been playing games Resident Evil, Silent Hill since they first came out (10-13) and other shooting games an so on. I have not picked up a gun/bat/metal rod etc and shoot/beat someone with it. Least my parents had the good sense to explain that it was just a video game and there for entertainment. Parents and other mother fucking cock sucking conservatives, blame games rather then take a look at the parents. You think parents would look at a games rating before giving it to said child, or think mental illness might play a part in a child's behaviour after playing an M rated game rather then blame the game itself! Also hate how these religious assholes get involved saying games teach witch craft an stuff. Should keep to themselves and suck on the dick of religion and mind their own business."

22280,what is the music that plays over the 'Allegations to Mass Shootings' part?
22281,fucking xenophobic idiots....
22282,"""You should have realized this was a possibility since some people lost their children in that battle.""
So this game shouldn't have been published because people lost their children in that battle? Well... what about all of the WWII and Vietnam and Desert Storm games that are out there and net millions of dollars annually, those are ok? Hypocrites."
22283,With the Pokemon controversy... Let's just say there's plenty of reasons why I've stopped going to churches.
22284,ok number 1 is soooooo true in 1997 i played double dragon after school next day i went out into the mean streets and with my brother bimmy we must have beaten 100s of people up looking for my girlfriend who was kidnapped by some asshole who played way to much donkey kong and to this very day i still hate climbing girders
22285,non - gamers are fucking stupid they really need to take that gamer don't go out and kill people its the gang banging ass whips and also policemen they all start shit and then blame some gamer for doing nothing unless the gamer has a disability
22286,Darkness 2 spine pull should be on this for extremely graphic and controversy. It literally causes you to pull the enemy's spine and skull out his ass.
22287,"Maybe mass shootings happen more often in the US because they have little gun restrictions? I live in Canada, no one I know owns a firearm of any kind. And that's just the way we like it. Instead of solving the problem with the constitution, they instead point the finger at a game that oh, how many millions of people play? I don't see them going on rampages now, but OBVIOUSLY it's the game that caused it. Columbine being a prime example, where they said it was because Eric Harris played a lot of Doom.
The stupidity of media knows no bounds."
22288,"IF videogames would make normal people become violent serial Killers, then there wouldhave been millions of shootings all over the world duringthe last decade.And IF videogames would be the only reason formassmurderers to exist, how did Jack the ripper happen.
Blaming Videogames for Shootings is just the too easy and too conveniant answer for those, who don't want to really look at the toppic."
22289,I wonder why all of these games are meant for individuals 18+.
22290,"This person was mentally ill and decided to kill some people.
MUST'VE BEEN THE VIDEO GAMES. OH JEEZ, BAN THE ENTERTAINMENT.
Why do all the idiots get put in the media?"
22291,The goddamn news channel are only earning off from news like this because parents fucking support them.
22292,"i think i speak for everyone who lives in Australia when i say
The Australian classification board is a piece of shit
first we get introduced to a new R18+ rating even though games like saints row 4 and south park the stick of truth still get censored
i mean saints row 4 was banned and denied classification here in Australia only because of 2 things 1. references to drugs and 2. an anal probe gun and because of the shitty dildos at the classification board they made volition restrict the game so we can only play with other people in the country
don't get me wrong i love saints row 4 but this is just fucking unacceptable
south park was banned and censored because of what? abortions?
the idiots there need to realize that if a south park game is released it's gonna be as bad and probably more offensive than the show but they don't rate it R18+ and still censor it that's horseshit
GTA V is up the ass with references to drugs sex and violence and it gets an R18+ rating on the first try
like i said before don't get me wrong i love all these games but it's fucking rigged
and it's all thanks to that Michael Atkinson cunt in the video
the rest of the world is lucky to not have a dickhead like this running the classification board
you may get like 1 or 2 games banned or censored here and there but it's nowhere as bad as here so feel lucky and don't be a fuckwit towards us"
22293,"Whole life is a videogame, cause you can shoot people on the street without being punished, as long as you can declare it as selfdefense. Very easy in the moment in most of the states in USA, isn't it? But sure, the goverment needs to find a scapegoat to distract the attention from their own cruelness, like selling more guns and tanks to warlords all over the world, which kills more real innocent folk than most people can imagine. Why can't those fuckos not go and stick a barrel into their asses and pull the trigger. They would do the world a real great favor and the press should follow them immediately, those dumb hypocritical fucks. Peace."
22294,"Basically, anything Fox News says about video games (...or anything else) is bullshit."
22295,"joeliberman, FUCK YOU!!!"
22296,Fuck the news
22297,man....Australia sucks.
22298,"Similar to the Modern Warfare 2 example, anyone else remember the stink that was raised over the fact you could play Taliban in that one Medal of Honor game?
Another Story I was surprised not to see here was JFK: Reloaded...and the contest to best recreate the assassination."
22299,"If they complain about Mortal Kombat back then, Imagine now"
22300,"Does anybody know the name of the song that plays throughout the video, or is it just something they made?"
22301,"1 thing i don't get:
WHY WOULD PEOPLE SAY THINGS LIKE THAT ABOUT POKEMON?! IT'S A KID'S GAME!"
22302,The press is bored.. they need a new bone.
22303,"So your aloud to be an American who can mow down ""terrorists"" but you can't be an American has to go undercover who kills civis 
Fuck the news"
22304,And fuck Australia with there spiders and game banning but Australians most of you guys are cool
22305,Fox News and most news station just report on them because they can't explain why they perform crimes
22306,"To answer that last question near the end of the video, number 1 is what ticks me off the most. Video games are not to blame for mass shootings, people's choices are."
22307,"10) Anyone whose actually played Mass Effect knows that's not true.
9) Satanic arts? Really? If anything I would have thought the Christian Extremists would have condemned the game for having ""evolution"". And seriously PETA? Couldn't give a crap about games that involve players killing humans, but having violence towards animals is unacceptable. I guess kudos to Pokemon for pissing off both the far left and the far right.
8) Not true.
7) Ok, so the game is fairly gory and fighting games generally appeal to younger kids. I can see why parents would be upset by that.
6) Guess Australia has never heard of freedom of speech.
5) GTA thrives off controversy, but it's rated M for MATURE.
4) I realize that real people died in the battle it was portraying, but it shouldn't be any more controversial then a movie that portrays real battles.
3) Done in poor taste, I think, but rated MATURE.
2) Yeah, pretty much everything it's accused of being.
1) Conservatives continue to attack the gaming industry because it's still relatively young. However, most of these mass shootings that are blamed on video games had shooters that didn't even play violent video games. In addition, the negative effects that video games are claimed to have on it's players have not been backed by any scientific data. Blaming video games is just a way of dodging the real issues which is guns."
22308,THIS WAS UPLOADED ON MY BIRTHDAY
22309,"American Conservatives: Lets ban video games to keep people from shooting other people!
Normal Person: Uuuh why don't we just ban guns
American Conservitives: BLUUUGH CONSTITUTION AND PEOPLE WILL GET THEM ILLEGALLY!!!
Slightly more intelligent normal person: Okay, first you don't ban them outright, just make them harder to acquire. If a criminal can't get a gun from a shop they might not try to get one. Black market can be dangerous, difficult to contact and not to mention illegal. A criminal could be caught before he commits murder. But you let police, farmers, trainers and people with authorization have access to guns but to be regulated. Handing guns out willy-nilly to anyone is not the best idea. It wont stop it completely but surely it will help.
American Conservatives: You're a fucking idiot that will never work!"
22310,"Here's the facts, Humans know right from wrong, they know not to kill another human, hence we react badly when another human is hurt, injured or dead. Not to say in certain instances, we react differently, but we weigh up the moral scales in our heads. Games do not change this, as we use different judgement. We do not apply the same moral values.
This doesn't stop feminists, heretics and fascists trying to ban everything though. They manipulate facts, interpret meanings to suit. Most haven't even played the game. The best thing, if you apply the same tactic to Films, you can pretty much come out with the same results, cherry picking scenes and manipulating the story/scene to suit your fascist views.
Short version of my statement - We live in a world of fucking idiots."
22311,"I'm going to be perfectly honest, to me, at least, America seems to be much more offended by violence than any other country. In Britain, none of these controversies would make it past page 23 of the daily mail, yet the same topics are discussed on major tv networks in the USA."
22312,Where is Postal 2?
22313,"There is one four letter phrase that can diffuse a LOT of the more ridiculous controversies, ""IT'S JUST A GAME"". I'd really like to know why some people can't seem to grasp that simple concept..."
22314,"Wow, Australia really needs to rethink it's video game classification system. Especially since its STILL banning games even though they have an 18+ rating? Can you say ""broken system""? Think of all those poor aussies that have missed out on hits like left 4 dead 2..."
22315,"OMG thosepeople who think video games cause crimes and stufff are retarded! also those mega christians who think pokemon is witchcraft, those mega christians are showing a bad example of normal christans like me! mega christians need to stop thinking so damn much, it is just a game..."
22316,"Idiots if you are upset over a video game, don't buy it."
22317,"Video games influence peoples actions. i think now, do you see me on the news jumping on mushrooms and going down pipes"
22318,"RE5 Trailer controversy. White guy killing black parisitic zombies in Africa. Completely overblown, but slightly entertaining. check Screwattack's top 10 OMF WTF!? Moments for more info."
22319,"I've played this pokemon parody 10 secs ago. When I've unlocked the first video....I cried )',:"
22320,manhunt. gta. cod2 my favourite ...last time now i play simulator and more to smartphone than computer..we no longer use computer.. alot violent game in android or ios
22321,Yeah people going ham with real weapons is definitely the fault of violent video games and not because the weapon rights in america are complete bullshit. But please don't take away peoples FREEDOM (to become mass murderers). Fucking idiots...
22322,"The left blames guns, the right blames video games... How about we address the real issue.  Mental health."
22323,"The government is so dumb, all this talk about real deaths are caused by games with players killing players is such a free box. Like a guy can kill his neighbor an say he got the idea from a FPS game or killing game. That's exactly what #1 proves to say..."
22324,They're still gunna make games like that cause money talks
22325,"Dear Fox News:
Kindly shut the hell up."
22326,"PAPER IS SHARP, IT CAN BE USED TO KILL BAN IT FROM SCHOOLS"
22327,Call of duty black ops 1 killing Castro should of been here
22328,"I remember old PC DOS rpg game Knight of Xentar. There were tons of erotic pictures of manga chicks:D We liked it so much, i dont even remember if this game launched some controvery in this times. And I find a quite controversial Witcher 2. I was quite shocked in some moments. Its really cruel game in some parts, but also good game."
22329,You can justify the mission No Russians. It ethically okay to shoot Russians since they are the incarnation of the devil.
22330,"My son didn't have that choice... Seriously, he joined the army..."
22331,I surprised Gears of War wasn't on this list.
22332,"Alright, I've played GTA, CoD, Gears of War, all of the videos games that have been blamed for real life murders and never once have I considered re-enacting the video game in real life... That is because I am not an idiot who has no idea what ""in moderation"" means. Now what I mean by ""in moderation"" is for example... I listen to music as many people do. I attempt to learn something from it a lot of times. For instance I came to conclude this based off of music that I've listened to ""Don't just be alive, live. However don't live too much or you're life will run out."" This simply means, don't live life scared to do anything because of injury or death risks. However don't be too bold and get yourself killed. In some of the same songs that taught me what I just mentioned the lyrics ""I don't like you. I just hate you. I'm gonna kick your ass."" had followed somewhere within the song. However I don't run around beating the crap out of everyone I dislike. So same should go for video games. You have to FILTER what you allow it to dictate in your life. If you play a video game like... Kinect Sports, maybe let it provoke you to go outside and ACTUALLY play sports. However if you play GTA let your brain (Which a lot of people in this world have a hard time using...) tell you that you're not supposed to go out and steal cars, murder people, do drugs, start town riots, and so on... Video games aren't the problem, the people who play them are..."
22333,"this video is so true. i play cod gta battlefield most games i play are violent with killing (I don't have saw or manhunt as it is stupid running around killing in stupid ways). one person in school feels that violent games make violent people and i said to her ""So i am one of the dangerous people in the whole school due to constant playing of these"" i bought sleeping dogs because of it's environmental attacks what are brutal. and no Russian is one of my favorite things in the whole of gaming. two more things when a Norwegian man went on a mass killing spree they asked his friends if he played world of Warcraft WTF. just wondering what do Russians think of no Russian?"
22334,"I think that ""playing 1st person shooters makes you a demon"" idea these idiots get is WAY too overblown. It's the idiot's choice to go kill people! I love FPS games! Do you see me on the news killing people?!!?!?!? NO!"
22335,"if playing a shooter makes me a killer, then driving games make me a pro driver, flyers make me a pilot and magic games make me a mage"
22336,I'm surprised the Columbine game wasn't mentioned here. That was some messed up stuff right there.
22337,Okay so man hunt on the wii yes you mimic the actions of stabbing isn't like the same in cooking (NEW NEWS STORY KNIVES BAND) how stupid do the media get all of them actions originated from what we do in our everyday lives and the terrorism scene it happens we all feel guilty and pissed off at the end it opens our eyes in a way.
22338,The no Russian mission you can chose not to kill anyone and just walk till the end
22339,"Go figure that all of these ""controversies"" involve FOX News."
22340,One I remember is JAY reloaded now that was huge.
22341,Yeah PETA are douchebags for making that pokemon game. I played it and...
22342,"I'll admit that seeing any violent images can desensitize someone who's not mentally developed to understand it and parents can't watch their kids 24/7. However, what people who constantly blame the game industry for criminal-behavior in kids seem to forget is that parents have had Parental Controls in various forms for the longest time. These parents were just too lazy or irresponsible to actually figure out how to use them, and with the ESRB making it so easy for them, there is really no excuses they can give for that degree of negligence.
Also to #9: There has been thousands upon thousands of games with Mages and Wizards and the one people associated with witchcraft was POKEMON!"
22343,I can't watch this video without being angry.
22344,3:30 FUCK YOU GOVERNMENT. I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO GET SOME OF THOSE GAMES.
22345,"all im going to say, is as a liberal, conservatives especially on news should actually do something called ""research"" shocking I know."
22346,5:54 ............BUT there are no children so its 100% acceptable......lol
22347,"If you couldn't be bothered to watch the video, here's the main story. Americans are stupid and they take things too seriously.
You'll disregard this comment though, as you probably already knew that xD"
22348,All of the above
22349,2:50 that's 50% of Noob Saibot :)
22350,"100000000 guns but blame the videogames for death, AIDS and crime.... MURICA"
22351,Really... Its pokemon they just have to think of it that way
22352,"For god sake, people SERIOUSLY need to calm down... they're fucking games!"
22353,I still have no idea what the hell a Pokemon is.
22354,dude i want to play the mission where you massacre citizens in a russian airport. that's awesome
22355,I dont get banning the war one espeicially when people lost their children in WW2 and their are a ton of those...WTF
22356,"To all the people who blame video game violence for real world violence: If playing Mass Effect makes me a killer, why doesn't Goat Simulator make me a goat?"
22357,"It's weird. Back when MW2 came out and played the No Russian mission, I had no problem with it. I actually remember having fun shooting all the helpless people. But going back to it now, I find it a lot more horrific than I did before. I think I would actually skip it if I were playing MW2 now."
22358,That's a load of shit about State Of Decay and Saints Row 4. They weren't even banned atall there was talk and why did you show Left 4 Dead 2 and Falloutthat isn't banned in Australia never was them and others on the 'banned list'.Thosegames was on shelfs before theR ratingcame to Australiathe only good game that has been banned for Australia isthe Manhunt all of the rest of it is bullshit you cunts don't live here or actually been here so don't talk shit about it assuming it's true.
22359,The only thing offensive about Manhunt is how shitty it is
22360,"There should be some sort of discussion on this topic between smart guys and media,not some dumb senators derping around. No HYPOCRISY and things like that. Some games are ok,even if u shoot with guns and such,but other games takes things to another new level...Period. Whats next?a game where u have to be some sort of a natzi leader and kill blacks and other minorities because Merica?"
22361,I'm obsessed with video games but I don't go around murdering people
22362,"Having mental illness definitely doesn't mix with certain games, but I also think that some age groups just shouldn't play certain games. I don't think children should be exposed to games with detailed sex scenes for example. I mean preschool kids watching porn feels wrong right?It's definitely not easy to determine which game can be played by which group and I'm not all up for limiting games, but limiting access of some games to some age groups might be something."
22363,I did not like the bad backlash bully got really the only thing I see that it deserved was weapon use at school
22364,Funny how there aren't any real problems in this world
22365,shooting controversy nothing to do with games all to do with selling guns to morons and that the truth
22366,america cant blame their shooting on video games and musicians their would be allot less shootings in america if they would just make their gun laws stricter
22367,"Maybe it's just a coincidence that in America video games are a lot more accessible to everyone and a lot of people had them so its just a coincidence the killers had them too?..Maybe he played them before he becomes a psycho but how can they be sure it's the video game that drove him insane in the first place?...These news channels have illogical arguments....Instead of blaming the recreational activities these guys did before they went insane,they should check what kind of pressure and problems that are in the world that made them go insane...."
22368,"Really why should congress should give a rats ass about video games. You as the parent do not want your kid playing the game you enforce your rule. Anyway when the younger generation grow up their be less debate about the subject.
Why are parents are so overprotective of their kids anyway? By the time you are 16/17 you should be able to handle most things and If you can't there is a issue that needs to be addressed with you."
22369,IfGTA makes me a killer then I'm also a goat because of goat stimulator
22370,It's incredible how some people are so dumb they relate any kind of violence to videogames....
22371,I think it would be cool to see a top ten video on Easter Eggs in video games
22372,"My reaction to number 1: it was claimed that some people use guns because of gaming. But I say it is the other way around: without real guns existing, there would be no shooting in games. Besides, there has been a lot of violence since the beginning of mankind. And now, games and movies are getting the blame. Sigh...."
22373,"video games cause related violence in the real world'? ok then, please tell me, where the heck was the video game back in WWII which caused Nazis to put jewish people in concentration camps? where was the video game that started the cold war? the crusades, want me to name any more MASS KILLINGS? i can go on for a long time, games may have a little to do with the violence but the are OTHER FACTORS to consider. stop trying to pin it on 1 thing, and you'll realise just how fucked up the WHOLE WORLD is!"
22374,"Surprised that none of the Bioshock triology games were mentioned. those three games are in my top three ever played games on any console, and I understand the religious touches they dappled throughout the game, predominantly in the third, Bioshock Infinite, which to me, was interesting and made the games more entertaining. I know there was a lot of controversy over Infinite solely about the religious beliefs and if Irrational Games/Kevin Lavine/2K games crossed the line at some point(s). I personally think that the whole reason behind video games is to experience what it would be like to break the social norms and morals which we would never do in life but CAN do in video games which is harmless because it's digital and does not exist because it's a game. And what I just said could be taken into controversy as well and applicable to real life shootings because video games made them do it blah de blah blah so i'll stop here :p."
22375,"I say what every psychologist has sad ever, its not the violent games that kill people, its psychopathic people that kill people. Its the media that makes people go kill people (statistical fact that media coverage on mass murders cause more mass murders). If its brutally realistic, let it be. Correlation is not causation. It would be the same thing as saying, 100% of all mass murders drank milk, so everyone who drinks milk must be a mass murderer. Fuck people trying to use false statistics for sensationalism and media pandering."
22376,They use video games as a fucking scapegoat it's unbelievable! They should find out what causes people to massacre dozens of innocent people instead of blaming the virtual gun.
22377,"Well, let's break it down. Women need to zip it, lock it and put it in the same place they use to be promoted and pretty much be able to get away with vile crimes, REAL crimes. Complain about being sexualized all you want, I don't believe in hypocrits whatsoever, especially when I see atleast 20 sluts in the streets per day plus a thousand earn millions and Oscars for just being what they are: Whores. GTA's hot coffee thing, I can understand, but blaming videogames for your kid's bad behavior when its you who's an awful parent and, not only is buying something a kid is not legally allowed to have, but also replacing love and care with a videogame. Of course he/she's gonna be messed up in the head when puberty kicks in and the hormones and emotions start to malfunction. Pokmon is racist, satanic and entices children to blood sport? Well, I guess Super Mario killing your friends who were turned into brick blocks and being an insade animal abuser is ok. Doom is satanic? So let's ban every religious videogame, cause religion is not something you can legally make money of, if you're refering to a real religion, let's stop broadcasting things about religion too, if everything with a demon is satanic. The war in Faluja has people riled up? How about the WWII? Americans, Russians, French... even innocent civilians were mass murdered because of one insane guy with daddy issues but those games don't get banned. Manhunt is too violent? So is the war in Iraq and the U.S loves to shed blood for oil in order to take control over it. A game about traping and killing women... America seriously, I'm sick and tired of your 18 year old housewives married to 60 year olds getting brutally murdered."
22378,"Mental Illness and GTA DONOT mix, i repeat, DO NOT mix well"
22379,I hope our government chokes on a dick. JS
22380,I bet they'd find a way to blame Tetris if they could...
22381,no video game can really offend me some can make me uncomfortable but none can offend me
22382,The Pokemon one made me LMFAO. Oh no Pokemon is the Devil. COD warns you about that mission and you can skip it. #1 always pissses me off. I play fps all the time and I've never thought about going to a school or mall and shooting abunch of people for shits. The main problem is the fucking parents that allow their little shits to play games and don't tell them why you can't really shoot abunch of people for fun in real life. Its wrong and you will end up in jail.
22383,"Moral of this story: Americans are fucking retards.... games dont cause shit, games are for entertainment, nothing more. The game does not cause a murder, psychological issues cause them. There may be the VERY RARE case of a murderer that plays videogames, but whoop dee doo, it's like saying that every musician is a drug addled alcoholic, just because theyre called musicians..."
22384,i will like to see the parents of those kid who had the so called violent video games see the new ones
22385,"You know, if they think that these should be banned, then ban simulations exclusively for the military."
22386,I mean it's a freaking game.. Why do these people try to ruin everything?
22387,These feminist bitches have to stop..They ruined america
22388,New game call call of duty ghost
22389,"I have a brilliant idea on how to solve the violence problem: Maybe parents should start being involved in their kids' lives instead of expecting TV and video games to raise their f*ckin kids for them. If you don't step in and explain why the games should not be replicated, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO HAPPEN.
I've been watching horror movies since I was 11. You OBVIOUSLY see me going around dressed as Pyramid Head ripping people's skin off. Duh."
22390,"I still play games like this, and im 15"
22391,Jack Thompson = Retard
22392,"We should just ban everything bad and all stay inside and lock the doors..... omfg I hate these ""do gooders"" !!!"
22393,I've noticed that the parasites who start these controversies never played any games.
22394,It really pisses me off that people try to blame shooting on games. In the past people blamed it on books and movies. What people really need to consider is that some people are fucked up in the head
22395,"Yeah, because video games were made say I dunno over 9000 years ago! Jesus, humanity really is lost."
22396,I hate Fox News. It's just a game!
22397,everytime you say press its pretty much just FOX news
22398,"honestly, if video games didn't have violence then they wouldn't be that fun; even packman has violence with the ability to eat ghosts and all"
22399,"who was the guy at the end?? he's from florida, disbarred from being a ;lawyer, always blames video games for anything.."
22400,the mw2 one shouldn't have been there because the game warns you at the beginning of the campaign and when the mission comes up and you can skip it
22401,i didn't know children were banned from entering airports in 2009
22402,"There's paint brushed generalities going on both sides of the debate. Mental illness plays a big part, though. For those people who have a hard time distinguishing fantasy from reality, certain games may help to desensitize them to violence. The same case can be made with movies. Most people do NOT become violent after watching an action movie, but there are always those couple of people who will actually act out a certain scene... like spraying someone with lighter fluid or that orange-haired loser who called himself ""the Joker"" and shot up that movie theater in Colorado. The point is that video games and movies are not, in themselves, going to cause the next mass shooting, but they can feed into some crazy people's ""revenge fantasies""."
22403,There was a lot of controversy over the chants in the Fire Temple in Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.
22404,People who make these games into controversies (basically the media) are just idiots... THAT'S LITERALLY ALL.
22405,"You know, I've always wondered why was it okay to fight Pokemon and yet dog fighting is absolutely horrid, lol. That said, I still hate PETA. Viva la Pokemon!"
22406,pretty sure in the future they will blame wars on Star Wars Battlefront.

22411,"What REALLY pisses me off about that Six Days in Fallujah game being cancelled, because ""I lost a son there"", is those same people that got it shut down don't have shit to say about WW2 games, or Vietnam games, and TONS of people lost loved ones in those wars."

22413,i personally thought that the god of war 2 and 3 games would have been on here because of the sex minigame
22414,Scientists clearly state that video games do not make you kill and they are good for your brain and help you make quicker real life decisions.....
22415,Of course its fox news
22416,Violence causes video games...
22417,"The ESRB probably seemed like a good idea at the time for parents
Except parents still seem to buy M rated games for their 10 year olds??
It would make more sense if people followed the ratings (even though half of the ratings are based on misinformation)"
22418,The last person said THE TRUTH
22419,I hate the part in modern warfare 2 where you massacre people. It's sad.
22420,5:17 a perfect example of why Fox News is total bullshit. She just kept on talking while he was trying to speak and defend himself.
22421,This is one of the funniest things I've ever seen
22422,do you think there will ever be a time where people realise its a game?
22423,"I wrote an essay on gun violence. From what I've researched, it's a load of bullshit. you have a special nerve in your brain to control your negative emotions. people like Adam Lanza and other gunmen don't have as much control over these feelings, and the first sign of violence can make them snap."
22424,YES american media is GREAT
22425,"Dumbass: ""Video games are the cause of all violence!""
Me: ""So who was playing Call of Duty in The Battle of Hastings?"""
22426,Bo2 is my favorite game
22427,"American senators are the worst in my opinion- they cant take a joke, jump to conclusions and entwine religion in the state. Grow the fuck up and understand that its for entertainment, not to create killers"
22428,I've been playing games for years day n night
22429,Most anything Fox and the anti-video game zelots say pisses me off.  The the fact all of them are basical Sentor Kellys only adds to it.
22430,"Gee, I wonder which video games caused wars like the Battle of Hastings or even the World Wars. If anything, virtual shooters make someone less likely to harm someone, since it sort of fulfils that need."
22431,Postal 2?
22432,A conclusion. People who don't play video games are ignorant morons.
22433,"wtf is with the night trap,"
22434,"oh look its all Fox News, so its all bullshit"
22435,"Murder for entertainment? OH DEAR, WE CAN'T HAVE THAT...unless it's Hunger Games amirite?"
22436,"The problem here is not so much kids playing these violent games, but rather parents who think it's okay to leave their kids in front of the game for hours essentially shutting the kid up."
22437,Strange I find religion more violent and controversial everything put together
22438,"Damn, so many people are complete idiots, there are about 95% of them"
22439,"Why are people SUCH panzies!?
Sure. Games have violence; but there ARE test to show games dont link to that!
And there is a LOT of it in games like GTA.. but their forgetting that movies like Rambo top violence and bloodshed as well."
22440,"my jaw dropped at the russian shooting in CODMW2. that was just pointless violence. ( not to say that vid games have a point, but like there tends to be an aim or a goal...)"
22441,What's wrong with mass effect is not real?
22442,Man I hate the thought police.
22443,Din't know that Laurence Fishburne was in Manhunt 2.... 6:29
22444,"Heh, people blaming shootings and murder on video games. LOL. idiots"
22445,look what kids & ppl dont seem 2 understand is dat is the parents fault ok is not the companies or the CEO's is the parents ans me this ppl of youtube if ur kid had an illness were he or she would take something literally would u let him or she play GTA Call of Duty or other M rated games unless ur a parent who doesn't give a shit i understand but 4 parents who looks out 4 their kids would u no right
22446,"""No Russian"" was a sweet and slightly funny mission, anyone who sees it as something serious needs to seriously step back from the BS and see that it's just a game.
I've been playing violent video games from when I was a kid with the first MK on Genesis and have never once tried to replicate or reenact anything from any game...the kids who do are either idiotic, have mental issues, lack of parenting or all of the above. Blame the parents not the game because they buy the games and don't supervise their kids."
22447,1 the Cod m4 2 Was Skippable For A REASON And pokemon You Shi@en whith me right?
22448,"I like the lady at the end. She was harping on the fact that MANY factors contribute to horrific behavior and to tie them to one single thing is irresponsible. The elephant in the room is mental illness. We allow scumbag criminals to claim mental illness as a cop out when facing the death penalty for their crimes. Yet when it truly exists and we have multiple signs that point to it in the perpetrator's life, we tie things like video games and movies to it. While I agree that mass media and video games are responsible for desensitizing people to the horrors of violence by glorifying and white washing it, we still have to come to understand that balanced individuals can partake in the entertainment without fantasizing about doing it for real. We can turn it on, have some fun and then turn it off."
22449,Its pathetic that people care so much about the issue.
22450,"Not being a dick, i know you guys wish to retain your right to bear arms, but i think there are too many guns just knocking around that anyone can get hold of...normal people shouldnt be able to just have a gun in a drawer upstairs for just incase.. its crazy. I am interested in guns and if i had the money or somewhere to go i would enjoy firing one, but it should then be locked away at the range. No good comes from everyone having guns."
22451,"Pfff,Manhunt2 ! ! ! i loved these game (`)"
22452,Its a fucking video game so get over it I dont need a video game to tell me that guns and violence kill people if video games get baned it will leasd to movies then tv and so on it will be an unstopable spiral out of control
22453,"no ""Thrill Kill"" ???"
22454,5:52 That wasn't even an objective. You chose to do it.
22455,1:02 I smell a feminist...
22456,life is tough i get that its sad and harsh but the world is just too sensitive
22457,It's simple tv hates video games. More and more people would rather play games as time goes on they are just trying to keep people away from fun but violent games and most in general by using the broad term video games. Then the parents won't let their kids play and indoctrinate them into thinkin that video games are bad so people keyed watching whatever the new sit com is
22458,I saw #3 coming...
22459,"Come on! If violent games made a person more violent, I would've killed right now! But I haven't, otherwise I wouldn't be posting this!"
22460,I guess its not a controversy as the boxes were pulled after 9/11. but take a look at Red Alert 2's original box art if you get the chance.
22461,I play shooters everyday for the pass 4 years and you wouldn't see me touch a real gun. The closest thing to a real gun that I have used is an airsoft gun on a professional playing field where they test the guns to make sure they are safe.
22462,This is so funny how people blame games for such violence. How about this as a suggestion Merika...stop selling guns to people?
22463,"5 words, fucking American media and politics."
22464,Every time Australia bans a game I get pissed off
22465,"I have my ""third eye open"". I see things differently and you all should to"
22466,Guarantee that children will NOT play or see these violent games
22467,the ESRB is there to make sure children aren't playing that stuff well that statement and ESRB are complete bullshit. ESRB can't stop shit and the ones who created that knew that as they were coming up with that idea. It's all fake made to trick us into thinking it could stop kids from playing them but in reality it's like ESRB don't even exist it's just an illusion complete bullshit there's no such thing it's impossible to
22468,"They want us to be ""blaming the parents"" rather than blaming and pointing all our fingers to them. They're the ones behind ALL of this. So please brothers & sisters, sisters & brothers let's keep all of our eyes and attention on them. We'll never know what they are about to do next with all this other stuff in our way let's ignore it and keep all of it away from our children it's all like poison to our brains."
22469,The government want our attention focusing on each other rather than putting all our focus and attention on them. That's why they invent all this useless stuff so we would be too busy talking about it other than discussing about OUR rights. The government will continue taking some of them away until we don't have any left and be powerless to stop them. Taking our right to bear arms is just the beginning they want us without guns so that we don't retaliate to what they are about to do and it's not going to be good. It's all obvious man.
22470,"It's not about parents not ""monitering"" their children it's about what these kids are introduced to. They are going to see violence regardless with or without these violent video games. What would help though is if everything and everybody would end all this therefore no more violent video games, no more violence on tv, & most importantly no more violence out there in the real world. The media knows exactly what they're doing with all this crap and they're doing it all on purpose so we all come to this controversy talking about ""blaming parents"" other than really worrying about our government to see and know exactly what THEY are doing."
22471,"I love how the media is all like ""videogames is why kids are violent! its all these first person shooters!"" when really its just lazy parents that don't want to take responsibility for their children's actions. People want to blame video games for violent kids instead of teachingthem better or owning up to their part in their child's psychological development, its just easier to point fingers at videogames and then try to censor the shit out of everything. seriously, if you don't think your kid is mentally stable enough to discern a videogame from reality, then don't let them play videogames, but don't use videogames as a scapegoat for all the messed up kids in the world either! videogames are rated for a reason, and it irritates me to no end (obviously) that people are constantly laying blame on them for all the violence in the youth when in actuality, its their own laziness and absence in their kid's childhoods that creates batshit crazy kids.
end rant."
22472,Fudge these video gaming bull poopers I wrote it like that so that they don't blow their heads off
22473,"Okay A. mojo this was a good list, and B. I would like to state as a 13 yr old, why are games ALWAYS to blame. What about movies! Movies have killing and violence and everything like that, so why target just games? You allow final destination to be aired on TV and in Cinema's, and that is the most GORIEST thing I have seen to date, so tell me one thing, why target games! Also, in a gaming universe it can be based off of anything real, but it is still virtual and if you don't want anyone in your family to play it, don't buy it (I'm speaking to you PARENTS and GOVERNMENT). p.s. I live in Australia and I have one thing to say, STOP TAKING AWAY THE GOOD THINGS IN GAMES!!!! I would have loved L4D2 if I could hack an undead virtual zombie to bits. Thank you for your time, message me if you have in inquisitions about my statements."
22474,"I agree, simply blaming the video games for their irresponsibility is wholly irrational and stupid. You see, this is what disconnects me from current mainstream American politics.
You have right-wing conservatives claiming ""it is violent video games that effect the mental health of these people and that's what causes them to go onto mass shooting sprees in real life"".
And you have left-wing liberals and progressives claiming ""It's the guns and the access to the guns that are effecting the mental health of those of these people and that's what causes them to go onto mass shooting sprees in real life"".
Neither of these sides realize that it's NOT the video games they play, or the guns they own or the access to guns that are the problem. It's the repsonsibility that's missing in both of these issues. People are just not being taught actual responsibility anymore...
One can have a nation that has relatively easy access to gun ownership, but very low gun-related violence. Switzerland is a shining example of this, where everyone is required to have an assault rifle and know how to use it, very low gun-related violence.
Same goes with video games. As this episode has proven, there are many studies that run counter and dispute the claim of ""video game-related violence"" and many say that video games actually lead to LESS actual violence. Because they are more apt to take out their anger and fustrations in the video game instead of real life..."
22475,all of them are a bit ridiculous except for the Modern Warfare 2 terrorist mission. i remember when i played the mission i was a little taken aback ill admit and im a big fan of these video games.
22476,i want to play the war game
22477,"Why not just take away the guns?
Some american in the corner"" BUT WHAT IF SOMEBODY BREAKS INTO MY HOUSE OR IF SOMEBODY IS THREATHENING ME WITH A GUN, I NEED MY BAZOOKA""
Use a melee weapon or better yet, call the police and let insurance handle it and there wouldnt be an armed assailaint if guns are hard to procure."
22478,I bet in quite a few shooting cases the shooter has a history of eating vegetables. We should look for connections.
22479,"Murder millions of people and no one bats an eye, show some boobs and everyone loses their minds"
22480,The lady at the end knows what's up.
22481,if you saw the ronin symbole from saints row 2 your cool
22482,"I think when people blame video games for murders, they just want something to blame that is not the person and when blaming video games they think its ""OK"""
22483,i personaly believe that america is just retarded...:P
22484,POSTAL2 ftw
22485,People can be SO stupid
22486,"Also, regardless of your own personal opinions, games/movies/music are art. They are meant to provoke thought. You have the ability to not look at it or hear it or play it."
22487,"The reason video games get blamed so much in the media is these fucktarded parents who go out, buy the game, allow their very young children to be exposed to extreme violence and then expect nothing to happen. It's exactly the same as allowing your young child to watch violent films, except the video game experience is much more visceral.
I'm not saying video games cause violence, I'm saying that as a parent, I cannot understand where these parents get off on allowing their child to play games like that. The ESRB is here for a fucking reason. Stop blaming games, start being parents."
22488,Kevin McCullough clearly is a an idiot as he has no idea what sex acts are let alone looks like lol
22489,Would postal be consided controversal
22490,"That no Russian mission shocked me when I saw it, graphically horrible"
22491,if you don't like video games fuck off don't blame games when dumb fuckers think it is ok to shoot people. sorry for all the people who lost their lives but shut up about video games being to blame
22492,Australia and the US must really love Piratebay.
22493,"People should remember they're just games. I play black ops and cod ghosts along with a few fighting games, does they make me want to go out, beat the living  @&$! Out of people or shoot up a few places? No. It's also like the people who says guns kill people, ban them, take them away. No. If you have a room full of people 5 people with a table. Put a gun on said table and walk out leaving those 5 alone with the gun. Who's going to kill everyone? The gun? The gun can't pull the trigger on its own."
22494,5:59- .......holy shi*..... they allowed that?!
22495,"Games don't kill people, only stupid people kills people."
22496,"There's only one group of people to blame and that group is parents. Parents will always fuck up everything because they grow up in a different era than their children. By the time they catch up to what's really going on with their kids, they've already fucked up. Speaking about dinosaurs..."
22497,What I love about most of these controversies is that they are complete and utter bullshit.
22498,Am I seeing only Fox News and Republican senators?
22499,"By their logic, after playing frogged I'll wanna run out into traffic and try to dodge cars.."
22500,"Only in USA is so much TV News about violent in game. Here in Europe isn't even 1

22501,Just look at all the persons building cities when sim city came out. Or look at the number of persons who say that Dungeons and dragons was made to make people summon demons. Or look at the amount soccer players that can shoot a ball around the world to score. Really ...
22502,man parents are stupid its everyone elses fault when they see a game they dont approve of and it becomes a huge issue....how about dont play the game? ever think of that?
22503,People seem to forget wars that actually happen and not fictional wars hahaha how ironic
22504,"The media is so sensitive, people who are crazy go and do stupid shit because of games. Just because games have all these stuff doesn't mean anything. If parents don't want to risk they're kids playing games like these, then they should quit buying them M games, simple."
22505,Cod black ops 2 time and fate mission
22506,"All violence has and will be caused by video games. Yes, even the incidents before video games existed were caused by them."
22507,"Most recent one if i remember correctly. The craiglist killer and dark souls.
Smh"
22508,"Played over 10k hours of Counter-Strike lifetime probably, a game which has been blamed for a few of these shootings at #1. During my 10 year play period, I also had a grand total of 0 fights at school and elsewhere. Obviously, a correlation between video game violence and real life violence is evident here...."
22509,I just bought manhunt 2 adults only pcversion from amazonlike two weeks ago so yes you can buy it.
22510,Is it just me or is it every time they say in the press they mean FOX news.
22511,"I really hated seeing No Russian pop up in the controversies. First off some areas changed the game coding to where if you shoot a civilian, you fail the mission. (Germany I think did this.) Plus, you're never found out by Makarov until the end, even if you never fire a single bullet on the mission itself. You can go through the entire mission without killing a civilian, and are never found out.I can understand people's worries, especially in the GTA and Mortal Kombat area, but the controversy on No Russian is ridiculous."
22512,"I agreed with the MW2 controversy, the scene was unnecessary
but the Mass Effect one is ridiculous, a lot of people play Com. Sheppard as a woman, and there's tons of woman in the game that have pivotal roles in the plot, not there just to be a sex toy"
22513,the entire video games make people commit crimes is bullshit it has been proven that video games do not effect people negatively and if it does its cause they have a mental illness
22514,Less QQ More Pew Pew
22515,"im 14, i play games to blow OFF steam, gta,Dishonored...minecraft......pokemon. Its not like im going to go get a gun, go to my school and shoot everybody, you know why, i...have...common...sense"
22516,"I love parents, murderous rampages are are all fun and games but fully clothes sex is the devil's work."
22517,this is bullshit it is mental poeple not us fuckkkkkk
22518,"Phantasmagoria, anyone?"
22519,"Fuck USA, you can put the battle of falujah but you can put the battles of vietnam where a lot of asians where killed, americans too but did they ask to vitnam gobernment to let them do the game?"
22520,"This pisses me off more than when that one student got suspended for bringing a deathnote to school...
But seriously, they're just games."
22521,"My god, the media is so retarded. Ask any gamer if any one of these scenes effected them, and they'll probably laugh in your face."
22522,"Some of these controversies I can understand, but Pokmon? Seriously? PETA forgets that you're supposed to bond with your Pokmon and treat them as friends and equals. It's not all about battling."
22523,My computer crashed right after they said that Six days in Falluhja was never finished 0_o The video was never finished!
22524,Notice how many are one FOX News...
22525,Whoops meant to R instead of are
22526,You know what I hate parents who buy rated R games for their 5 years olds then complain about how much blood it's has and how violent it is like if it's rated are and there a warning saying its has blood and violence why do you buy it for your 5 year old? That to me does not make sense
22527,What's the name of the black and white game at the end of the video?
22528,"It's been a year and a quater, and the pussies here in Australia STILL haven't given the all go for the L4D2 'un-censored' patch yet."
22529,"""Obviously you expected some blowback because some people lost their children in the battle.""
""Y-y-y-B-Bu-""
""OK anyways.""
Damn. I hate how FOX and MSNBC deal with this shit.
Maybe it's just me, but isn't it good to recreate battles like this? I mean, maybe my great great great great etc. grandfather died fighting the Gauls when he served as a Cohort in the Roman military....Should Rome II: Total War be banned? Ryse?"
22530,and all of these people are elderly fuckhats that dont understand that fantasy if fuvkinmg fantasy and will always be this. humanity sickens me to the extreme.
22531,CORRELATION DOES NOT EQUAL FUCKING CAUSATION!
22532,execesive violence in the tvnews make insegure and neurotic people no the estupids games
22533,Why doesn't someone tell them about how giving false info to millions of people is dangerous to those with primitive brains?
22534,People suck sometimes.
22535,MAN I FUCKING LOVE FOX
22536,"the fundamentalist heavy right wing news network Fox will always claim that anything which is deemed fun and not filled with Christianity is satanic and destroying the american youth and will back there arguments with ""facts"" they just randomly thought of which end up becoming lies."
22537,"nothing did happen in hot coffee lol , it was not even sex , well in less there is a world where you can be fully dress and have sex at the same time , but we dont live in that kind of world lol , govt/people need to think before they speak , but that well never happen lol , to think they just had to pay out 20,000,000 hot coffee is still being miss lead by people"
22538,"If video games cause violence than what video games were played by Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler,Mao Zedong, or Saddam Hussein?"
22539,"Can't you play as a man or a woman in MassEffect, so it's a man or a woman who decides how many people he or she wants to have sex with."
22540,blame life
22541,"You guys should've also included in the Modern Warfare 2 segment about the skippable scene in MW3, of a family getting killed by gas."
22542,WTF LET US PLAY WHAT WE WANT ITS JUST A GAME
22543,careful peepz I play wildstar so ill prob be shooting off to another galxey soon to settle on a planet in my floating sky house while traveling around in my hammerball mount....and between that time I may even throw som emagic healing out
22544,The No Russian mission was put in there specifically to cause controversy though. It fits in so poorly with the plot that it's clear that they came up with it separate to the rest of the game.
22545,"I think that sometimes programmers can go to far but people need to stop bitching and raise there kids to know not to repeat what they see in video games. Also the people who rate the games need to properly rate games and Horror movies. I mean really PG13? When I was a kid they were rated R for a reason. Also if people are so worried about there kids doing stupid shit from playing video games then maybe they should not buy games like GTA, Mortal Combat, or Resident Evil.They are great games in there own respect. I'll admit that I laugh and do stupid shit in GTA its fun but I would never go out and kill people in real because I play video games. Everyone is capable of killing other people and it has nothing to do with video games. Just look at Lizzie Borden. There were not any video games back then. She just suddenly snapped and killed her parents. People were killing long before video games. And the only real reason there are more murders this day in age is because of parents not raising there children properly!"
22546,Video Games are the excuse of bad parenting. Wow.... So cod and Doom made someone shoot a school? C'mon.
22547,"See journalists, this is why we cant have nice things!"
22548,I'm not a big fan of call of duty but in one of the call of duties my freind said he stopped playing it because you had to kill Japanese peaple and he was Japanese
22549,"how can you call fox news a news station, it's basiclly just a bunch of retarded conservative rednecks screaming at thing's they don't understand"
22550,"Full motion on the Sega CD. AVGN, where are you when we need you? :P"
22551,"5:28 I would've been like ""bitch does it look like I give a fuck!"""

22553,"All these people need to keep their stupid unsupported, untrue, and nonsensical opionins.. its a game... not real life. geez"
22554,I hate Press they twist things until they bleed out and a lot of bullshit reaks from there words.
22555,That news story of that fat man bitching cause her son didnt get a second chance maybe if you talked him out of fighting a bs war he would of and to top it off its a fucking video game boo fucking who
22556,the mission No Russian was inspired by the columbine shooting
22557,Honestly i just laughed at the guy saying pokemon is satanic.
22558,The one that got me a bit upset was the portal 2 one that was shown only briefly at the beginning of the video...
22559,"its a video game people know its fake were not stupid, honestly the news and them are sooo stupid and annoying"
22560,"C'mon , most of the footage was from Fox News , everybody knows they're a bunch of assholes !"
22561,Fuck media
22562,"In No russian I tried to shoot ABOVE the heads of the civvies and tried to leg and arm shot the security and cops.
Also why dont we say that terrorist cell leaders are RTS players XD"
22563,animal abuse? jynx now has a purple face? fucking stupid
22564,"And I would bet that out of all the people who think video games are the reason for shootings and other crimes, ZERO of them have ever even played a video game. Jesus, politics just ruin everything. Be a person for once, and think with your own mind. It's not left or right, just have some common sense!"
22565,Fox News is such a dick.
22566,"Thats hilarious ""CoD: MW2 you get to be a terrorist."" That's what you call it? We have tons of ""terrorists"" in the CIA, FBI, DHS, etc... especially after the NDAA/NSA."
22567,"so people are aloud to make movies about real battles were people lost their lives, but when someone makes a game about a real battle shit hits the fan? this is bullshit"
22568,"How in the world is Pokmon satanic?! Really, Media, Really?"
22569,People actually take Fox News seriously?
22570,i find the pokemon being satanic bull shit and im religious
22571,"People do crazy stuff all the time , they have to blame on something , so video games get the ""heat"" ..."
22572,"To every news station saying some video games are ADDICTING:
You cannot literally get ADDICTED to a VIDEO GAME. Do you guys even KNOW what being addicted to something means? Usually, it means repeatedly coming back to something you feel you need, even though it has harmful consequences. Like drugs. But video games do not have harmful consequences. And having a withdraw from video games will NOT have any effect, unlike having a withdraw from drugs, when you are addicted to them, will make you feel crazy. (I think, i wouldn't know, because i've never been addicted to anything before.)"
22573,"Video games aren't bad. Lack of good parenting however is. I was practically born with a video game controller in my hand, and I have never killed anyone. People are irresponsible, and never accept their blame, so they look for the nearest inanimate object to blame.
Gun control freaks blame guns because they don't know how to properly handle, store, and/or comprehend firearms. They think that by making something illegal, it will be out of the hands of people who are violent and determined to cause harm. History shows that no matter what you ban, you can still get it and use it if you really want it. Examples include Prohibition and anti-drug laws. Making guns illegal would mean that good, honest, responsible people would no longer be able to defend their homes from determined, low-life criminals.
To blame video games is to say, ""I am a terrible parent, but I don't want to take responsibility for my actions. I want to live in a fantasy world where my child is an angel, even when I'm not looking."" I advise these people to allow their children to play video games, but help them comprehend A, the difference between game and reality, and B, and this is simple, right from wrong.
In conclusion, blaming things that aren't people, or banning the use of things will never prevent crime. In fact, it will increase crime, because people like to do what they're told not to do, and a lot of people refuse to take responsibility. What needs to happens is that a lot of people need to grow up, put their big-kid pants on, realize they have children, raise their children properly, and securely lock up their firearms, or at least keep them perfectly out of reach of their children...and don't let them know where you keep your firearms."
22574,im 11 but all the games i play is'nt allowed 4 people under 18
22575,"Man, if I went on a killing spree I wonder what game the news would blame. Persona? Look at those kids shoot themselves in the head with MAGIC guns."
22576,"im sick of the people of today that blame video games for mass shooting and violence. Before games like this were made there were still as much shootings as they are today, The people who do blame video games need to do there research more i mean seriously its just because they didnt have these cool games when they were kids they're just jealous"
22577,"I always get pissed off when games are blamed for some stupid thing. granted, some stuff in games should not be there."
22578,"oh yeah, that Mario thing that pets made is bullshit, it comes from a fucking leaf peta, not from real raccoon skin."
22579,what about mario kills tanooki
22580,fuck you people who hate video games and you peta!!!!!!1
22581,"I agree, violence in video games is harmful. Just look at Mario, now im out there eating mushrooms and jumping on turtles or pokemon that has now caused me to pit my bird against the cat to prove who was stronger!"
22582,"These people can continue to blame just shooters for all the shootings and stuff, but in reality no one gives a damn. They are just wasting their own time. I personally dont like FPS games but it is fun to play with some friends for a while. That is one of the reasons it wont get banned. The second reason is common sense. These people who murder countless others ( at least the majority of these people ) wont just pick up Call of Duty or Battlefield, shoot some people and suddenly say, you know what let me get a real gun and shoot someone! Nope, these shootings are the result of some type of mental conflict in their life, not one simple game."
22583,"Those who blame video games are just stupid and want to have something they dont care much about to take the blame. If u play the airport mission on mw2 and then travel to a airport and do the same,,,, damn, then ur so fucked up i dont even have words for how fucked up you are in the head."
22584,"Jesus this stuff is fuckin disturbing, especially that shooting massacre in #3. Way to realistic. Cant imagine how many psychopaths can get off on this shit."
22585,"I think this top ten should also be called top ten bitchy Fox News moments. They will never play or know anything about these games
It's just something to bitch about when there not accusing Harry potter
Of promoting satanism or have a five hour debate on how Obama brushes his teeth the wrong way. Damn Fox News ....."
22586,Wait so the people on TV are blaming video games because the shooter who was killing people was obsessed with video games? What the fuck man!?
22587,why is it that all gamers are to blame for mass murders it's like we have a split persona or at least that's what the government think
22588,"Studies show that video games do not cause violent tendencies in people. (You can look them up) Politicians need something to blame when shit goes down. Also, as a parent, your supposed to regulate what your kids are playing. I love video games, but I would never let my young children play Grand Theft Auto."
22589,"God dammit Aus, chill about everything else except video games?"
22590,All the mindless attacks on video games by the media make my blood boil!!
22591,man hunt was the beast game
22592,We have all this controversy about video games but not with movies that have much more horrific scenes. This world is messed up
22593,People just seem to need to take the chill pill.
22594,Liara was my most successful relationship up to date man.
22595,"Conservatives are fucking retarded. 
I have a mental issue or two, and am inclined to play violent video games, but it's an outlet. A way to vent my frustration without actually hurting anyone. Why can't they see that?"
22596,"I really hate the fact that people blame video games for shootings and stuff, my pet hate as a gamer, and that other war game that didn't come out l, yer it's bad and stuff that your family died but I'm pretty sure the game looks animated, world at war had heaps of people from reall battles ect. Lol"
22597,"I really hate the fact that people blame video games for shootings and stuff, my pet hate as a gamer, and that other war game that didn't come out l, yer it's bad and stuff that your family died but I'm pretty sure the game looks animated, world at war had heaps of people from reall battles ect. Lol"
22598,"#10)classic dumb bitch who cant sit and actually look into the details but must immediately jump onto the bs bandwagon of games go hand and hand with sexism
#9)classic bible thumping retards who cant get their own heads out of their asses
#8)... I swear it seems the morons didnt like to spend more than five minutes then making final verdicts like this 
#7) they should have done it sooner but you know... just keep putting it off like morons
#6) glad morons cant just CENSOR IT THEMSELVES or better yet GROW UP
#5) sooner or later it would be introduced so meh
#4) firstly, stupid bimbo can go piss off like the dumb FOX News moron she is. Secondly, is WWII ok then? Is it also ok for Vietnam? They were probably attempting to give off a tale of those soldier so people would learn of how it really is but you know go ahead and act like a snooty bitch.
#3) just skip it you ass holes while you keep talking in the news about sick psycho killers and rapists
#2) yep there is no defending that, it seems like it should have been taken down rather than #4 but maybe thats just me
#1) FOX News... you need to have your own controversies list with you idiots. Anyways, everyone who wants to blame games for shootings seem to not look at statistics. Games RELEASE stress, however giving a FPS to a mentally deranged person will FUCK THEM UP DUUUUUUH... I miss insane asylums..."
22599,"Bloody media/government. No No No, it's not because we have more gun's than people in our country, that almost anyone can buy almost anywhere. We'll just blame it on ""Call of Duty"". So when they ban all the violet games, and 10's of millions of people that used to play them, now come on the street and start killing instead of having an outlet, Enjoy it. Retarded Politician's."
22600,"I'm pissed of that people think manhunt and manhunt 2 are ""too violent"" I see where they're getting but seriously I played that game when I was like 8 and I have no ""homicidal tendencies"" now not will I ever"
22601,this is a bunch of bull. people need to stop blaming videogames for this stuff. all because someone played a game where they shot up an airport and got away just like that doesn't mean they will be tempted to. ever think they play games like that because they like that stuff. dumb ass bitches why don't you blame books or movies ever.
22602,FoxNewsFoxNewsFoxNewsFoxNewsFoxNewsFoxNewsFoxNewsFoxNewsFoxNewsFoxNewsFoxNewsMSNBC I feel like I missed something.
22603,"The reason for mass killings is not the video games themselves, but the parents suddenly taking away the video games after the child has already started playing. If you don't let a child finish the game, they're just going to finish it in their own way. Which is usually real case scenarios."
22604,What is ironically amusing is that these politically correct types are horrified at fantasy video game violence and yet have no problem having their country engage in real wars and have real young men and women sent off to shed real blood and really die.
22605,Games will always be the blame because no one seems to take the rating serious and these parents are buying these games adding to possible mental illness of these Kids.. Look how real they are how enticing you hardly see kids outside because of battlefield call of duty Medal of Honor etc theirs even a game where it lets you simulate JFK death....if people would play games and leave it on the game ? A lot of these problems would be none existent but some people don't even know they will end up blacking out and shooting shirt up in real life
22606,"Do none of the people who say that violent video games turn people into murderers consider that maybe these people with murderous tendencies are more inclined to play and like games where they can kill people, because they already feel an urge to kill.
If anything, video games provide an outlet for me and my friends. We can and do take rage and frustration and throw it at fake people instead of real ones."
22607,Gta should be number 1
22608,Now one is spoiling my ONLY time of fun cause a mentally disabled person who's parents or carers couldn't keep him/her under control and gave them a gun!
22609,Ye but with games like COD you can get someone to censor violence and in the no Russian mission if you get offended you can skip the mission
22610,Also you can be a woman in Mass Effect!
22611,"Regarding the mass shootings controversy, correlation does not mean causation. But to be completely honest I think violent movies are more harmful than video games. When I'm playing games like COD or some other FPS, what I'm play is still animated. Movies, on the other hand, sometimes go to extensive lengths to put as much gore in a movie as possible. Just a thought."
22612,"This is why we can't have nice things, because people always have to turn around blame it on other things without looking at the root cause. Videogames are not the root cause for violence in real life, it's the people themselves and the way they are mentally.
Someone doesn't just play couple minutes of the game and then decide to go ""Oh hey this is fun, lets go outside and shoot something up for real"" that just doesn't make sense at all to make it out as something like that. People always have to put the blame on something else, tunnel visioning themselves on one thing and saying they're related somehow which is irrelevant to the current issue to the cause."
22613,The portal 2 controversy was so stupid they put it in the game to make him seem more evil
22614,"You know, the news media needs to shut up and focus on other things. It's not something for them to talk about. Sure, a few people are inspired by video games to commit murders, but that's their choice. If you allow a movie or game to influence your lifestyle, then you the individual are making that choice. Plus people commit crimes based on their psychological profile."
22615,"I've actually heard that COD MW 2 scene is kind of an experiment on society. You don't actually have to shoot the tourists. You can stand still or look at the books in the book store, and you will still pass the level. And yet everyone always shoots the tourists."
22616,"If this video were made a bit later, I'm almost sure that the Stick of Truth would be on this list"
22617,u guys need hd
22618,"good list!
any one who says vedio games cause vilonce should remeber thatyou can't legislate to the lowest common denominator"
22619,gta5
22620,Wonder how payday 1 and 2 are being bashed...
22621,"That Pokemon/Peta thing was such bullshit.
Just one of the millions of reasons I hate that ""organization"""
22622,ISN'T ESRB THERE FOR A REASON. I MEAN MY GOD THE GOVERNMENT CREATED IT. PLUS I LOVE HOW THEY SAID THE GUY IN THE NAVY SHOOTING PLAYED HOURS OF GTA 5 AND THE SHOOTING HAPPENED BEFORE IT WAS RELEASED. IF U DONT HAVE THE MENTALITY TO PLAY THE GANME THEN DONT PLAY IT!
22623,"puritanism in usa is big, i heard a controversy about rpg games just because the hero can married at 15? so they had to change that but they don t care that preacher are often pedophile criminal , oh well sometimes the limit between puritanism and stupidity is so thin, almost invisible, and pokemon is bad cuz it teach kid to spell magic , come on but those same moron find normal to teach their own progeniture to operate a gun (in the name of the lord, eeeyaaa)"
22624,"mental illness is a big problem. but in my mind video games is a great way to channel it. I'm glad GTA and violent games are still aloud to be released, but I fear ""they"" will try to stop them. If we all had games which just involved following a rabbit eating carrots or something we would channel that primeval instinct into our normal lifes. its not just the same with games it's with movies too. I've noticed (well forced) into this whole pg 12 certification coming out. making classics and future films to be ready for all audiences. Alien films a 15 certificate WTF, Predator 15, but the biggest one terminator is now a 12 certificate. A film about killer machines. I'm rambling and drunk just pissed off and sharing a few"
22625,its not the games that cause shootings its the people playing them
22626,always fox news whinging
22627,I still haven't got to the demonic or witchcraft part of pokemon.
22628,I thought Six days was supposed to be an informative game about the tragedy?
22629,whats 3:28 - 3:30
22630,"Mojo people... you are a bunch of hypocrite ridiculous people, censoring some ""sex"" scenes but showing the most gruesome ones... Classic sexually frustrated american behaviour..."
22631,pokemon isnt about..... satanic anything
22632,"I think that if you're going to make a game based off a real-life war, you need to wait AT LEAST seventy decades after the fact"
22633,"Most of these controversial games are FOR PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF 17........The same as seeing a rated R movie!! Yet more stupid adults are ready to bitch about video games than movies....because why??? Because they're afraid of kids playing? WELL DON'T LET YOUR KIDS PLAY THESE GAMES! Let adults play these rated M games....You wouldn't let a 10 year old watch a rated R movie, so don't buy your 10 year old a rated M game! SIMPLE!!!! And yet these stupid assholes constantly try to petition politicians to censor and restrict the sale of these games to even adults!! So stupid!!!"
22634,I love how all the news clips are form Fox News. I love them so much. Always reporting the news in a completely factual and un-biased way.
22635,"Oh I got one. SWTOR's gay planet. Not a huge story, but it was absolutely absurd!"
22636,"You know the ESRB ratings are there for a reason and even though the people working at game stores warn the parents of the content in the games they still ignore it and say ""oh, they know it's fake"""
22637,Hearing people complain about video games causing real violence makes me want to kill people. Not the video games themselves.
22638,And Wait... What game was #1?
22639,"Wtf? So should all the WWII games stop because people died in that war? Are they all offensive? If anything, games like 6 Days in Fallujah can be a good source for people to learn history while also keeping their interest and focus by being entertaining."
22640,"People need to get this through their head. Video games doesn't cause people to make mass shootings, what makes people kill other people or mass shootings is other people."
22641,"I played games that were considered ""over-the-top"" in many different ways (God Of War with its executions and sex minigame, Mortal Kombat with the obvious fatalities, and I'll even enjoy a game of Call Of Duty (Only the original MW).) when I was 9 all the way until now. I haven't killed anyone, I haven't even started a fight in several years. If you go out and shoot someone, ""The video games told me it was okay!"" is NOT a valid excuse. Pictures on a screen don't hold a gun on a real person and pull the trigger. They're all just CG graphics and code that do exactly what they're supposed to."
22642,"Games dont make Murders
Guns make Murders.
Instead of crying about games those douchebag politics should talk about weapon laws... A Bunch of idiots everywhere..."
22643,Fuck Fox news
22644,The man hunt is understandable and maybea handful ofothers but most of these makes me want to slap the people who claim such things. I mean MAGIC in pokemon? Yeah because throwing small MECHANICAL balls makes me a blasted wizard doesn't it?
22645,MORTAL KOMBAT!!
22646,"God. Blaming video games for everything. I hate people. And what's with the guy saying there should be warnings on video games???? THERES A RATING ON IT. It's up to the parents to decide if they should let their kid play it, if they're below the age rating. And women are not always objectified In games, there have been many games where a woman is the main character. Females are also shown as objects in books,movies, tv, it isn't just games."
22647,"I fucking love it.. some nut-job goes mad with a gun, it's not the fact he lives in a country where guns are easy to get a hold of (buy one, take one from your alcoholic dad's cabinet, get one of a friend or, hell, fucking FIND ONE), no, it was video games.
The video game magically made a gun appear in his room and told him to go and shoot someone who once called him a faggot at school.
Pathetic."
22648,there was like a 10 year old girl who pulled her parents out of a flipped car because she saw it in gta. saved their lives too
22649,The lady at the end summed it uo pretty well...you can't just blame video games...he had mental illnesses and that's why he went on a massacre.
22650,I had serious fun on No Russian. You mad Society?
22651,"you can't just blame shooting games as the main reason people get guns and shoot another civilians. those shooters must have suffered from a mental illness, that's my opinion. increase the prices of ammo. each bullet costs 500 dollars, for example."
22652,"I fucking hate that they blame the video games for some guy with mental or physical problems shooting or stabbing people , guy killing people , blame the video games .... Fuck that ain't true"
22653,The postal games though
22654,"Fox News, you must love it."
22655,"The the thing about trying to connect video games with mass shootings is that so many people these days play video games. Of course if you look at the personal lives of many of these types of criminals you're going to find that they loved video games. It isn't considered the fastest growing entertainment industry for nothing.....except for porn, naturally."
22656,"Wait? People actually shot civilians during ""No Russian""? You guys are sick, they never once gave you instructions to shoot civilians, you made that choice on your own."
22657,this is why i hate people
22658,Australia can buy and play Saints Row 4
22659,"First of all, there's nothing wrong about making a game based on a historical war. We've done that in board games and Indie War Hammer play. From the ancient times to battles in WW2.
And to see such theocratic, war mongering conservatives, shamelessly hammering these game makers for a recent war is just hypocritically sickening. These conservatives are the ones that are so enthusiastic about engaging in wars with other countries (IN REALITY), not to mention profiting the deaths of these young men as an excuse to chastise anyone who does not seem patriotic enough in their eyes.
In fact, you know what? If these right wing zealots love the idea of fighting so much as a form of patriotism, then we should just dump all of them in the most violent place in the world, with no armor or medical kits, so that thankfully these people will be less likely to comeback. Cause I'm sick and tired of these self righteous old men gleefully sending young men to die in wars that these law makers won't even participate in."
22660,do a top 10 on the best video game deaths
22661,Whats that background noise on the 5:28 mark?
22662,I have san andreas and I remember doing that code :3
22663,All the press is fox news haha.
22664,"I found out most of these people haven't even played any of these games and there they go judging it for all of the fact of killing and stuff, haven't they ever heard of an old saying ""never judge a book by it's cover"" if they have then why were they picking on PORTAL just for 1 small joke in the game they go ape doodoo and say video games is what's wrong with the world if that was the case then explain to me why people were more violent in history. Oh no history is ok but video game these are the type of people that really tick me off"
22665,"Are you kidding me all of those protesters are such idiots, I've played a lot of violent games and I have never once wanted to go outside and kill random people for the fun of it, also one person even says that they found some guys records and he was mentally ill then she goes on to say ""we can't just go on to blame 1 video game there are so many out there"" SERIOUSLY you just said the guy was abnormal there are normal people out there like myself who play video games and don't kill then there are people like those guys who are abnormal"
22666,"I couldn't get past mass effect, I just raged and I just can't... Women are seen as sex tools in mass effect?! WHAT?! Have they even looked at the game?! Kasumi takes down a fighter ship with her bare hands, Liara becomes the Shadow Broker, and need I even Mention Aria T'Loak? Leader of an entire galactic community?! Seriously, Fox News is like a group of 7th graders who didn't do research for their papers and didn't even bother to check their sources. Old news (no pun intended) I know, but it still irks me so much that they do this to EVERYTHING people enjoy."
22667,"You want sex? Witcher, trust me. There's a lot of sex. Especially the first one with the cards. I needn't explained more."
22668,The only effect video games have on people is one maybe short term fear through jump scares or what ever but the other is life lessons playing call of duty maybe like a couple times a week is going to improve your reactions and make you more aware of the things around you or playing fifa this game used to make me want to go out and play football or learn a new trick or gta v admittedly there is some controversial scenes but it warns you and by now people should know what to expect the people against these games are the pretentious assholes trying to justify a murder if anything that makes them as bad as the person behind the gun
22669,you can get SoD in Australia
22670,IT PISSES ME OFF WHEN THEY BLAME BLOODY VIDEO GAMES FOR MURDER
22671,i hate how people at gamestop say that theres rape in gta when ive played the game AND THERES NO RAPE ATTTT ALLLLLLLL BARELY EVEN SEX IF YOU CALL NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE IMPLIED SEXUAL ACTIONS SEX
22672,I'M FUCKING DYING WHY DID YU GUYS HAVE TO CENSOR THE HOT COFFEE MOD IT LOOKS EVEN WORSE THAT WAY I CANT BREATHE
22673,Videogame Controversy: XBOX ONE (All of it)
22674,"that custer's revenge (correct me if i'm wrong ^_^) is just, well funny. hahaha XD"
22675,"All of these allegations just irritate me intensively.  If they always blame video games for these things why don't we go through the same arguments for movies.  Interactive or not they are (spoiler alert) FAKE!!! Seriously news companies, get your underwear out of a knot and stop harassing video game companies over something like this and go back to reporting on something important."
22676,"Dude, it's stuff like this that really ticks me off. Video games are not the issue (99% of the time), it's the people who play them. JUST LIKE OH, I DON'T KNOW. GUNS?? Like seriously, jesus christ. People need to pull on their fuckin big girl panties (Or big boy boxers, in the case of a male) and get the hell over it. If your kid is being naughty and bad after playing a video game, take a step back and look at YOURSELF and see how well you've been parenting them. Like seriously, I'm 14 and I play violent video games, and I'm just fine. But, TL;DR people just need to grow up and stop being whiny little bitches."
22677,"Not to mention, you can be a girl in Mass Effect... loll"
22678,I was hoping the Resident Evil 5's racism controversy would at least be mentioned simply because of how silly that claim was.
22679,5:30 What the FUCK is he saying?? ehhhhhh ehhhhh ahhhhhhh
22680,"I was going to say something about this but the woman speaking at the end of the video basically said everything for me. I am from the UK and yes we have controversial media when it comes to some games... Manhunt for instance but America seems to be the predominant voice when it comes to hating on games that portray any sort of digital violence. However, like the woman at the end of the video stated ""we have to look at every aspect of a person(s) actions"" and not just blame it on a video game. A lot of the people who commit crimes like mass shooting sprees and mass murder aren't psychologically in a good frame of mind, they could have played Barbies Horse Riding and went on a rampage because they didn't make a certain hurdle during a track event. The media need to stop spinning things on the head when it comes to video games because in reality, the human population has been subjected to violence since the beginning of our time.... whether it be from barbarism from the humans during the ice age to even when Moving Pictures were first created. Violence is a primal instinct for survival, how we then intend to deal with these impulses is what ultimately sets us apart from other species of life on this planet."
22681,its funny how its always fox blaming everyone else for the problems in the world
22682,i love all that game....
22683,If I wanted to shoot someone I'd use my nerf guns jeez kids aren't harmed by games
22684,"I cant stop laughing! After this video I looked it up and there are about 12 scientific studies that say ""People who have accused games of violence or harsh behavior have never actually played a popular shooter such as the famous videogame series HALO"" . I can not stop laughing at the idiots who say video games are bad! Its also be proven the violence and criminal activities in kids ages 6-up have gone since major shooter games have come out!"
22685,"correction, manhunt is still available.   On STEAM"
22686,they need to stop blaming video games for the act of some people . they need to blame them self for alowing there children to get out of control. i hate that people want to blame someone else for there own fault . if you believe video games are violante then dont buy them no one is forcing you to buy them .
22687,"i regularly play violent video games and guess what... i don't get the urge to brutally murder people in cold blood for no reason. scientific studies have actually shown that playing video games can actually be good for brain function, reaction time and help you make difficult decisions faster in real life..."
22688,"People are so retarded. They accuse games of so much bullshit, yet they never actually played a single game."
22689,lol 6:00
22690,"I wish people would just shut up about video games and shootings being related. I play cod and gta and i'm horrible at shooting guns. And people need to understand, video games arent for kids anymore. And then there's the people calling for video games companies to not make violent video games. If someone who shot a bunch of people was obsessed with die hard or saw, no one would go around saying they need to stop making them. But when video games are involved, its different apparently. Its not the developers problem when a kid gets addicted to a video game and shoots people, its the parents who bought him/her the game. At Gamestop and other video game stores, they ask if you know the game is Mature when your buying for a kid. People need to get it through their heads, video games dont make people kill people, the availability of guns, bullying, psychological issues, and inadequate parenting make people kill people."
22691,"I get so angry when People say that game violence leads to real violence.
I mean, My brother is level 75 in GTA 5 and he couldn't even punch someone."
22692,5:55
22693,"Never-mind that mulitpal scientific studies have shown that removing real guns does nothing to reduce crime and violence, but we here at watchmojo ignored that as much as the press ignored the video game studies"
22694,"6 days in fallujah shouldnt of been pulled it would of told a story about the brave men that died for a good cause, if they pulled the game because people lost children yes that is a tragedy but what about call of duty people lost parents and grandparents in wars why are they still around then?"
22695,Anytime someone says video games cause shootings it pissed me off
22696,hey super hero movies have violence and guns in them too maybe they should get banned!
22697,"Americans, can you explain me number 4? So problem with this game is so many your soldiers died, and that women is mother of one of them? I honestly understand her pain, but why do people always talk about death(s) of your soldiers, while literally millions od civillians are killed by them? For example, some 60 000 of your military members died in Vietnam. Is this big number? Very big, its as much families who lost someone. However, does anyone of you know how many people of Vietnam died in same war? Do you wanna hear number, do you care?"
22698,"I hate it when the media blames video games for mental illness or for mass shootings. The scientific research cannot lie. IF YOU DONT LIKE THE GAME, THEN DONT PLAY IT. It's as simple as that"
22699,"It's weird, I know soldiers who love War video games. Go figure."
22700,What's the game at 3:15?
22701,"Conservatards: don't play games, yet complain about them. only some of their complaints are legitimate, like Mortal Kombat or Doom."
22702,"So some of these games offend people?! You get offended, then what?"
22703,that black woman at the end knows
22704,I laugh at foxnews
22705,Hey guess what no Russian from mw2 was a undercover mission all the objective is follow makrov so they don't have to kill
22706,Let me see if I understand these guy's. They knock on Fox for being reactionary( I agree with that) and yet when they reference the news in any of there top 10's they pick Fox about 90% of the time to use in there clips. Is the Mojo staff a bit bipolar or something?
22707,"I've been commenting alot on your videos tonight, but I have to say this:
I'm not really surprised that Fox is the network that mostly bashes games.. They blame everything for ""ruining America"", when in fact, they are the ones ruining it."
22708,are you serious australia??? no fucking way i would put up with that shit
22709,"I hate how stupid and irrational people with power blame video games over bad things.
Video games are made for entertaintment how ever it doesn't phsicologically affect the players, it's the natural infinite human stupidity that makes all those things.
Because in one way or another it's stupidity that makes you take such decisions."
22710,Minecraft is apparently a satanic game
22711,"i can't believe i just heard that preaching cunt say pokemon is satanic and rant about how evil it is. bitch it's called fiction, fantasy, NOT FUCKING REAL. seriously who in their right mind would think pokemon could teach a kid, or shit even a adult, how to cast spells and enter witchcraft. wtf !!!"
22712,all that much attention just means that the game will sell more.
22713,"""The killer had mental issues, was taking multiple medications, has been arrested several times for violent behaviour, had access to his father's guns collection and was bullied heavily at school"".
Sounds like video games are to blame to me."
22714,"I always hate how video games are the first to be blamed when an unstable person shoots up a crowd. It's always video games and not maybe oh, i don't know, mental fucking illness or gun control or parenting or anything fucking else"
22715,"Ed Boon the original ""Noob"" Saibot"
22716,Fuck that MW2 No russin misson was bad ass
22717,"Australians can play saints row. I should know, I am Australian"
22718,i was hyped about six days in falujiha and was super pissed when it was cancled
22719,i want to shake that black ladies hand at the end of the video. that person understands what is really going on and that's what we need to focus on.
22720,"I love how all the clips of people complaining were from the bigots at Fox News,lol."
22721,"0:54
I don't know a lot about games, but what the hell happens in ""Mass Effect"" that makes sex with aliens ""the most realistic"" ever? A vibrator and a fleshlight pop out of the Xbox?"
22722,"The Six Days in Fallujah is heartbreaking, because the way I picture it, the game would have been the world's only realistic war game showing the heroism of the men who lost their lives, and wouldn't have been another goddamned COD clone. There would have been no multiplayer, only story mode. Yes, that would have driven away the COD fans, but would also attract gamers who are intelligent, and understand the gravity of the game. Instead of whining middleschoolers bitching about killing or being killed, you'd instead have a fanbase of people who genuinely honor the game and the real people who lost their lives. Again, this is just the way I picture the finished product. But Fox News leading the alarmist charge made certain that America would never be threatened by a new form of patriotism, written in the language of our time."
22723,"For me, the point in playing a game is so I can do something I could never do in real life. I don't know if people do things because of games or not, but it doesn't make sense to me."
22724,"I'd love to know what game Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels, Goring and many more were playing when they planned the genocide of millions of Jews, Homosexuals, Disabled................. that'd be a hardcore game!"
22725,"When the media links shootings to video games, that just makes me want to rip my hair out because the person who does the shooting is mentally sick beforehand not because of the playing of the video game."
22726,I would of so bought number 4
22727,All I got from this is fuck fox news
22728,No Russian was one of the most boring MW2 missions anyway.
22729,"I was so annoyed by the women that says Konami had it coming that the games was banned since ""people lost family members in that battle""
uuh yeah just as in WW2, Vietnam, Afghanistan or every other non fictional war that is featured on video games today"
22730,"Man, people are ridiculous,  if your child has any psychological problems then don't let them play the game, don't punish the company."
22731,"Surgeon simulator does not make me a surgeon, fifa does not make me a pro football (soccer) player, so why should any fps and action games make me a murderer??"
22732,Fox News needs to chill out.....they're full of crazy people.
22733,"You know, before video games, comics were blamed for the violence by those with mental illnesses or just otherwise a violent nature. It's just people searching for something to blame, and it won't be long until there's some new form of entertainment that people will see as the cause of all evil."
22734,I find it hilarious how every news clip was from Fox News.
22735,You know I was in the Army. I knew full well what I was getting into. I was paid to risk my life. If Americans really want to help shut the fuck up stop having a holier than thou attitude and instead of defending your children's deaths be glad there are video games to keep the kids on their couches not in the military where if they suck at being soldiers they get good soldiers killed
22736,"Video games dont make people do anything but they introduce people to things that would otherwise not be a part of their general though pattern. So of you think about it for a second a young man playing call of duty is being subliminaly programmed to accept war and terrorism as a normality and therefore support these acts of violence in the long run. Use your heads for a second... When you get really into a video game you find yourself thinking of playing this game when you have spare time, this distracts you from independently seeking out a world view."
22737,"I'm really sick and tired of people saying jinx has a black face, she's based off of Japanese mythology + a relatively new Japanese fashion statement of tanning your skin very dark. Please get these things right, looking to find error in things can diminish the value of truly controversial subjects."
22738,"What about ""Thrill Kill"" for the Playstation 1, which never saw the light of day?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrill_Kill"
22739,"In order to be on this list, a controversial game needs to have been covered by more than one news source  Huh, I think ""more than one news source OTHER THAN Fox News"" would've made this list more interesting..."
22740,This just irritates me.
22741,"I played Mortal Combat (the newest one) at a friends house. Couldn't believe the kind of violence. And I usually don't have a problem with it- but that was just simply put, disgusting."
22742,"God, that Atkinson idiot made all those games banned, why did have to be my country, Australia? Damn it"
22743,There fucking games they should just leave them alone xD. its better to have people murdering for fun in games then to do the same in real life instead.
22744,"Yup, blame video games for shootings. Because world war 1 & 2 were also caused by games..."
22745,3:27 what game is this from? xD
22746,"I dont understand why violent games are blamed for murder and stuff like that. I think we need games like that, so we can get an understanding of real life. When newsreporters say an violent game are why shis idiot killed an inocent, they can go fuck themselfes"
22747,games are games those reporter need to find something more important than hating games they used to play. also game are made for fun not to in curage people to do bad things
22748,"NOT EVEN POSTAL?
THA FUCK?"
22749,"so does anyone want more controversy? good
the new game smite was attacked by several religions for making all the female gods no more than hey let's play her so we can look at her.
Kali Aphrodite and Keith i think? were changed Kali was given a new skin and her blood based abilities were replaced which made her just another high DPS assassin instead of Kali goddess of blood and destruction.
Aphrodite and Keith were only given a skin change but still they did nothing to change the source material they looked more or less the same but people got angry for it all the same.
they were even more ""beautiful"" originally but everyone gets mad that you can see Aphrodite cleavage even though she never even wears anything on the statues or that Keith wears a realy small dress when she won't wear anything on the paintings and hieroglyphics it is just dumb they never changed anything but everyone freaks out and ha a heart attack over this
so what do you think about this?"
22750,"Even though all of this is old news. It still gets to me how idiotic society is, Seriously? sigh"
22751,wtf 5:27
22752,Pro Guns but Anti war in video games come on
22753,Where is Payday?!
22754,"you can blame it on one video game or two video games. Yeah no, a schizophrenic man who believes his microwave can talk to him, better blame video games for his mental illness"
22755,"Fox New Always Talking about Video Games LOL!
PS: Take guns out of your country if you don't want 50+ school shootings per year."
22756,"Wait, wait, wait, you're going to ream conservatives for blaming video games, but you're blaming the gun, both of which are inanimate objects? To quote Matt Stone ""I hate conservatives, but I fucking HATE liberals"" for good reason."
22757,Christians are fucking crazy.
22758,Lmao ! Pokemon is satanic xD religious people need to chill tf out on life . How tf is pokemon satanic ? I swear anything is satanic to them . Toasting bread is satanic . The bread turns black . Illuminati
22759,I hate people who always blame games
22760,The guy that said pokemon had animal cruelty was a massive idiot.
22761,fox news appears like 7 times in this video
22762,"Involving that Fallujah game, I know that lots of people were killed and even more were injured, which is horrible obviously, I dont think it should have been banned because how many world war 1 or 2 games have been released where millions lost their lives?"
22763,I played that mission on mwf.Sweet.
22764,pokemon how the fuck is it satanic
22765,"0:24 lol, seriously? They put an ESRB rating on the game for a reason"
22766,(null)
22767,Oh wow video games don't make people kill people that's almost the same as saying guns make people kill people video games are not a phycological weapon or tool that triggers anybody's mind to do bad things that's just either bad parenting or the kid has no parents or their mentally disable and shouldn't be playing games anyway... I know people including my self and some terrible bad kids to that have been playing gta and doom and twisted metal etc.. Since the day we were damn near born lol
22768,"Anti-Whites are flooding ONLY White countries with non-Whites, which will change them into minority White countries- Genocide.
Anti-Whites don't demand that Black countries be flooded with non-Blacks.
Anti-Whites don't demand that Asian countries be flooded with non-Asians.
Anti-Whites say they are anti-racist, but what they are is anti-White.
Anti-racist is just a codeword for anti-White."
22769,im not gonna lie i thought dead space would be number 1 cause you know...car crash victims.
22770,all it a game !!!

22772,could you guys do a top 10 THQ games
22773,"What about COD: Modern Warfare 2? It was in the news because some people were offended that one level has you play a terrorist (although it's an undercover assignment) and people are massacred in an airport. Interestingly, the producers installed a skip option so you weren't punished for not wanting to play the level. Also, the news media never mentioned that or the fact that you did NOT have to shoot people to advance to the next level."
22774,whats the game at 8:30? never seen it before
22775,Lots of FOX
22776,i played pokemon black and blue....i cried for 30minutes after the chest vid
22777,news?? whats news???
22778,"PORTAL 2 LOL, ADOPTION? REALLY?"
22779,The whole COD series should be on here...
22780,"for every great idea,
there's stupidness,
when pokemon gets popular,
churches try to get back attention out of their asses,
for every violent fucking game there's FOX,
(as the same as church channels),
where there's a game they POSSIBLY don't know shit about dumbass news groups will be,
(possibly everything in this countdown),
when we the people look back we'll laugh at our stupidity,
(even when I've played every game now)
and when we try to forget.....GUESS WHO THE FUCK DOESN'T!?
thank you......
(audience claps as all of fox leaves)"
22781,"1: I hate it when people blame video games for tragic events if that person did a bad thing its because of there own free will, because there is something wrong with them. And if it involves a kid, that's the parents fault for letting them play to begin with and not looking at the rating because its THERE job to watch over them"
22782,"Hey Fox news, it's 8 at night, and 317 million American gun owners didn't kill anyone today."
22783,Wtf??? The no Russian mission that was absolutely horrific!! Why do we even have to virtually kill? It's like people have no soul these days
22784,"8:05 really? he said he liked games so thats why you said he did it??
yo man hitler liked art, so all artists are mass murdering racists just waiting to happen."
22785,Sts.row 4 and stay of decade is out in Australia
22786,I ned the Name of theme that you used att 0:06.
22787,"I kinda laughed at the one about the war game based on real people and stories, simply because reporters are [sort of] supposed to have an objective perspective, or general neutral attitude while reporting, and that woman is very obviously condescending with her final statement"
22788,"Violence in videogames: No! Those computer generated graphics are far to realistic when showing violence!
Violence in movies: It's just a movie, it's not that bad so i'll take my 10 yr old to see some gore flick.
^LOGIC^
In all seriousness though, my buddy showed me that footage of the ""No Russian"" level when I was in gr. 10 and my jaw dropped, was so surprised that was a part of the game. Im glad they did make it optional though as some wouldn't feel comfortable with it, I personally don't but it was nice of them to give players the option."
22789,"I remember when I first got Modern Warfare 2, I got to the No-Russian mission and I just watched in shock as the terrorists mowed down everyone in sight. Was it disturbing? Yes. Does it mean that video games need to be censored? absolutely not. I hate how the media will take a game like GTA and put a negative spin on them to frighten parents, without truly doing any research. The GTA series have amazing and well written story lines, but the only reason they get attention is because you can torture a man for one mission( was also a shock).
Having the controversy in the game is definitely an important part of it. It adds impact to the message the game is portraying. It makes you think and feel. For example, the mass effect sex scenes aren't just something you can queue up whenever you wanna rub out a quicky, It's a build up in the story that you have to work to, with hours of gameplay. The sex scene is just a biproduct of the relationship you built in the virtual world. I remember the last sex scene between Shepard and Ashley in ME3, and it didn't make me view women as objects. it didn't make me wanna go become a rapist or something. It was something meaningful. I just wish the media would take more than 5 minutes to research a game and print a hateful biased, poorly sourced news article on it."
22790,"Watch the uncensored game play of Manhunt 2 on SomeOrdinaryGamers channel.
He also has Manhunt 1 game play"
22791,5:57 is FUCKED UP! I cannot believe someone would actually think about putting that in a game. Who thinks of this crap?
22792,"I hate congress, good video though"
22793,"So glad you made this. I hate seeing on the news that a shooter played Call of Duty, ""so it must be why he did it,"" although there are 100s of studies that have proven video games are not the cause."
22794,"There's only retards working at Fox ""News"" for sure."
22795,My mom believed Pokemon was satanic when I was a kid... She threw away all my collectable Pokemon figures. ._. I'll never forget that day.
22796,"im still wayting on manhunt 3.
what are you doing rockstar?"
22797,fuck people aganst these games there just games
22798,Pokemon is not about witchcraft also the Pokemon agree to battle
22799,"Whoopee, more discrimination.  All I hear is ""what do you have against african americans, what do ya have against feminist Americans, what do ya have against fat Americans, whada ya have against physically impaired Americans, what do you have against 13 year old Americans, what do you have against Samantha Colon Americans? Your a horrible person.""  Do any of you see the dumbass logic these people use? If I told a black guy who was very dumb he was not very intelligent he would call me racist.  Well, Obama was smart enough to use it to his advantage."
22800,"Tell me, if I picked up a pistol that my mother just laid there and shot a friend, I wouldn't be blamed, nor my mother, but call of duty would be blamed.  First white slavery promoting discrimination now this?"
22801,HONESTLY FUCK MICHAEL ATKINSON
22802,"Whenever I hear controversy over video games, it pissed me off. Three fucking things to understand follows : 1. Video games are not reality, if you (The Gamer) cannot properly understand the simple concept of ""If I go on a mass shooting in real life, there will be consequences"" you shouldn't be playing GTA where you are a criminal, you should be playing shit like Mario. 2. If you play CoD, or Battlefield, that doesn't entitle you to the honorable title of ""Soldier"" you're in a fucking video game, you're not doing what we do on an actual daily basis. 3. Parents......Games are rated E-A for a reason. Do your fucking job as parents to censor what YOUR child plays. If I can hear your 8 year old son squeaking over my fucking Xbox Live mic on Battlefield or Call of Duty, GTA 5, Halo, or other games that are far out of both his maturity level and psychological capacity, you should re-think your parenting strategy. Video games are not the problem, People are. Don't play shooters if you aren't mentally capable enough to differentiate fantasy from reality. It'll save loyal, mature, responsible, avid gamers like myself and others from a whole lot of bullshit and censorship of our games that WE play RESPONSIBLY. Thanks :)"
22803,what happen to thrill kill for ps1?
22804,looks like Americans have real butthurt about games....
22805,Fox news shows up a disturbing amount of times in this video...
22806,I crawled up in fetal possition and cried for 3 days straight when I heard Six Days in Fallujah was cancled.
22807,"The biggest bullshit one was 6 days in fallujah, people got so butt hurt for no fuckin reason, I mean lets be real, if youre going to say, that game portraying war as fun is bad, but MW, Battlefield, everyother first person shooter is ok you have already lost the arguement. Thats just 21 century pussy shit, I didnt hear ww2 vets crying about all the ww2 games, or vietnam vets crying about there games. Somebody always has to ruin shit by thinking they have a right to be offended"
22808,"Games don't fuck people up, fucked up people do fucked up things, because they're simply fucked up. And i used a lot of f words, snap..."
22809,"With No. 1 on the list, it only takes someone to stop and think before realising the argument that games cause violence are flawed - particularly since highly graphic violent games are still are less than 20 years old,but mass murders have taken place way before then."
22810,I HATE WE PEOPLE ALLWAY BELIEVE THAT IT IS A VIDEO GAME THAT MAKES PEOPLE COMIT CRIMES IT IS HOW THE GAME IS PERSEVED BY THE PERSON.
22811,sigh.
22812,"Conservative news is an oxymoron, run by actual morons."
22813,03.25 what game is that?
22814,03.25 what game is that?
22815,"I grew up playing slaughter fest games.. I am not violent at all.. I refuse to kill house spiders, I live in Australia. I played the censored version of l4d2 then finally ""acquired"" the real version which was much better!! that arsehole in SA just likes to watch us all burn.. Oh yeah don't forget to sacrifice the blood of innocents so the mighty Pikachu won't kill us."
22816,not mojo i mean the press and stuff.
22817,God these stupid people make me SSSSOOOOOO f**king mad!!!!
22818,"wait, so I'm meant to go out and kill people when I play video games? Wish I'd known that, I""ve been playing some of the most violent shooters for the past 10+ years, Never had any urges to kill people, but maybe I'm just disabled."
22819,i hate it when these stupid preachers make entire sermons to bash on pokemon. STUDY YOUR FRICKEN BIBLE FOR GODS SAKE
22820,MK will always be #1...it made game ratings. #2Manhunt seriesfor obvious reasons. mass shootings shouldn't even be on this list. that is tied up in GTA and FPS's or any game with a gun really. More of like aside note about what these games have been said to havecaused. Rather than an actuallist spot. (Example - When the shooters of__ were asked why they did what they did. Theysaid they were just re-enactingwhat they played on GTA and ect.). So GTA and other games should get a bump up in that case. don't know why I am going on. I just hated that #1pickI guess. done now.
22821,Why is pokemon considered satanic?
22822,"Ah of course, always new that Pokemon was witch craft. Lol"
22823,good ending
22824,That is stupid there just games people who do the shootings in real life are people who just go crazy or are deranged
22825,"Liberals, conservatives, both have tards among them.
Democrats, republicans, both tear this country apart."
22826,in norway a woman claimed that Doom contained nudity.
22827,"It's like, let's see them try to play a video game alone, retrieve the data, and watch them become a hypocritical controversy..... I have no idea what i just said"
22828,Right so snobby people say video games are bad but they go out on shooting parties ??? There's some pillocks in this world nowdays
22829,"im pissed off because these days parents can just ""blame it on the game"" and something else games are for fun, people!"
22830,"Lol, demonic pokemon. Wtf.."
22831,"freaking media blaming on video games don't they get it messed up people do messed up things, idiots will do idiotic things"
22832,"When it comes to the media they lie constantly about what is good or bad they when a developer makes a game it is out of their own imagination and gives the player complete free will like GTA or Mass Effect; however when it comes to the COD games campaign it seems nothing more than just a war movie or storya player has to go through. Like the game Six Days in Fallujah I do understand the debate what I feel is completely different. To me it is a part of history that will be forgotten the story was immense and to make a video game is the same way as making a movie. It was done out of respect, a lot of people cannot understand this. This was a innovative way to make history real. Giving the player options to act quickly as what a soldier would do. To understand what they went through. The lady at 5:01 talks about her son and people laughing and giggling while making this game. To me though her has passed she would never know what he would want. As disrespectful as that may seem I just feel as if history will never be retold. Do not get me wrong it is very sad she lost her son, but the world will never know who her son was. To me, as a veteran it is horrible and sad to be forgotten."
22833,I'm so sick of people blaming video games!! It is literally the next CRUSADE because on one side you have gamers on the other side you have non-gamers sounds the same as Christians and Muslims anyone? just less bloodshed i'll give you that one.
22834,People who blame video games are fucking idiots
22835,I'VE PLAYED VIDEO GAMES ALL MY LIFE FROM FUCKING MARIO AND LEGEND OF ZELDA TO FUCKING GTA 5 So what gets me fired up the most is when the media states violent video games are responsible for shootings or murders. it's proven by studies that video games who make you have fast making decisions make you smarter in real life. Also puzzles games Like zelda. i'm not a great gamer but most of the trouble i ever had in that games was figuring out where to go or do next. It takes more then a Call of duty or GTA to make someone snap out of control and start causing chaos most of the people who do these crimes have been diagnosed with some sort of mental disorder. Awesome top ten so subscribing to this
22836,"Virtual guns are good to be fault, only when parents' have no control over their fucking children crying and screaming while playing games. Control yourselves and your children, please, Mrs. 16&pregnant."
22837,"Like the lady said at the ending. Fucked up people do fucked up things be caused they are fucked up in the head, not because they play videogames. Instead of wasting time blaming videogames they should think of the real causes that'd make a human go on a murderous rampage, like their fucking mental health. I could go on but I made my point. Happy gaming"
22838,We need a video game where we have parodied characters of some of these media jack-offs that you get to gun down in the game.
22839,"Oh, congress.
It's really hard to even like you when you blame games for the mass murderings of innocents.
It's just a game. Didn't they teach you that?"
22840,Violent video games are the way forward for the lazy fat guy who needs an outlet for his anger.
22841,What about the whole suing of GTA V due to Lindsay Lohan?
22842,"The men who died at the Alamo and Gettysburg didn't get a chance to start over either, but people still play games based off of those and other scenarios, including D-Day."
22843,What does the fox say: OH GOD I DON'T WANT TO FUCKING KNOW NOW!
22844,"I'm just gonna say it, it's not the games that make people do those things they see in games, the people who do them were already corrupted before playing them. Also banning games don't work, because they taboo them, they become more of a big buy thing cause people will want to rebel and get it anyway. It works with anything, for example, they tabooed monty python life of brian because it was offensive to christians, and because of that, more people watched it."
22845,"For those of you saying that doing fucked up stuff in a game shouldn't make you feel bad, such as the No Russian mission, lemme ask you this:
Do you not feel bad when you read netorare hentai???
......
On second thought, go ahead and ignore that question."
22846,Only moms and conservatives bitch about the effects of games on the youth.
22847,"You know what... as a teacher I have to respond to this. To me this is neither a political or universal issue. I have students 10yrs old who tell me every weekend they are playing GTA, Assassins Creed, and COD. When I talk with parents they say, ""So, I have to ban my child from sleepovers, the bus, play dates with friends, etc..."" It makes me so angry when I hear, ""The parents problem, the parents problem..."" In this day and age you simply cannot stop the bombardment of violence and sex on TV, games, movies, pop culture, etc... I am not a prude by any means, its not just NOT EASY as a parent to shelter your kids from stuff like this. I have no of my own, but teach kids and listen to parents daily on issues like this."
22848,"S.T.A.L.K.E.R.:Shadow of Chernobyl was based on one of the most horrific nuclear disasters in history. I'm Ukrainian, and when I first heard of that game, I was absolutely shocked."
22849,That is bullshit I think crime is committed by choice and only a little is influenced by video games
22850,Fuck you fox news -_-
22851,You know all news casters piss me off. They'll do anything to keep their job even if that means coming up with some bullshit new story.
22852,"This is, why I love living in Finland. No censorship or controversies on video-games :p"
22853,GTA 4&5 is for FUN FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DONT THEY UNDERSTAND?!
22854,"I'm not defending video games at all but what I'm saying is that people blame video games for everything like for example, a kid in Florida brought a gun to school and his dad blamed Minecraft, a game that doesn't even have guns."
22855,"So, the feminists say that it is a man in Mass Effect that makes all the decisions in the romance sidequests. They did not do their research. The main character can be a man OR a woman!"

22857,I fucking love night trap!!!
22858,The No Russian Mw2 mission was pretty fucked up.

22862,"my actual thoughts inspired by this video were much to long so i poured them out over on tumblr instead, but i really do hate the way violent video games care so often blamed for violent behaviors"
22863,"Most of these are FOXNews or NBC, who the fuck thinks what they say is true??"
22864,Fuck Fox & Freinds
22865,BLAME THE VIDEO GAMES BLAAAAAaaAAaaAAR!!!!
22866,"Parents do not have to purchase video games for their children. There is a reason that people post reviews online and that video games have ratings. Everyone who plays a ""violent"" video game doesn't go out and commit crimes. Those who do, probably already have some kind of problem, and people need to find a person to blame. It depresses me."
22867,they hate games because they never play games..poor them
22868,"Uhm I actually agree with your list, but you totally forgot about Postal, how can you possibly forget it? I mean wtf???!!!"
22869,Those close-minded fascists said the same about D&D and other roleplaying games back in the 80s.
22870,All these people saying the games are demonic are trippin'. If you dont like the way the game is dont play it. Dont go cry about it and make a big deal.
22871,Ohhhhh god.... Game haters...
22872,"Doom, the film, is not great, but I read that a lot of Americans didn't go to see it because Doom, the game, got blamed for Columbine shooting. Although, from your videos, I learned that the shooters played customised levels, or was it even that?"
22873,"6:17""Realistic""
LMAO so hard."
22874,"Bullshit, I played plenty of violent video games and I'm still a decent human being. Now if you'll excuse me I got some coke to sniff."
22875,"Really wish 6 days in Fallujah was made, sounds like it would have been an awesome game. Yet again people taking video games way too seriously and the lady talking about the people playing the game laughing and having fun because they can respawn is ridiculous. That's almost the whole point of video games, being able to do something you can't do in real life."
22876,If video games made people do bad things I would be one of the worlds most wanted criminals by now.
22877,"You cant just pin videogames as the source of 1 fucked up kids mentality. Personally, I've been non violent and almost passive since the 7th grade. Guess when i received multiplayer killing games. The 7th grade."
22878,"Pokemon encourages.. witchcraft..?
Are people seriously this stupid?"
22879,"Is it me, or is society full of overly sensitive morons? Actually, thats a pretty clear answer."
22880,What's the game at the end with the chainsaw?
22881,"I don't believe these games should be banned. That said a lot of conservatives argument against games like these aren't that they should be banned by the government but that they are degrading the culture. To each their own, i play them and work in the industry. I've seen in California the effort to curb games lead by a Democrat. I've seen liberals ban and attack things they deem inappropriate easier than conservatives."
22882,I hate mainstream media First they blame it on guns then when someone proves guns aren't the problem they blame video games usually preying on GTA time and time again or the newest Call of Duty
22883,there such lairs video games don't do any thing
22884,so video game violence is horrible but in movies we can have as much violence as we want... i give up in the worlds large dumbass population.
22885,"I'm not gonna say that games had a good or bad influence blahdeblah. It is in my most humble opinion that the game is only ever what you make of it. There are certain varibles involved, but in the end, in all of life, it really is oneself that determines how something affects you. We live in a world where the improbabilities are decidedly impossible and the minority to be ridiculed and ignored. It is so easy to blame anything that looks akin to someting too much of a coincidence to be true, and ignore the other minor but present probabilities. Oh look videos games (shooting games) + shooting = bad influences. 1 bloody occurence and I still hear about that sometimes. I LOVE gaming and if one day I got caught in a shootout somehow would I get immediately blamed for playing games? Perhaps maybe that one guy was a hopeless pathetic who was easily influenced and a bit wrong in the head. That would still make one person. I sure at least ONE IRL serial killer watches/watched slasher fics, how come no one blames those?"
22886,I love my guns and my video games... Anyone who wants to take them will have to do so over my dead body because i believe in my god given right to LIBERTY!!!
22887,sooooo the call of duty one first of all you are able to skip it and if you think about it you aren't getting achievements for killing an amount of people IN THE GAME doesn't mean it should be a game to blame.
22888,"The Six Days in Fallujah game would have been great, especially done by Konami. When SOCOM came out, I remember playing that game and feeling like the hero. People don't understand that games aren't always about 'laughing' to have fun. It's fun to get lost in this world and be a Navy Seal, be Solid Snake, etc..."
22889,"dont let kids play violent games, parents are buying 13 or 14 year olds rated m games... people blow this out of proportion sometimes. dont hate on me for my opinion please."
22890,"I was laughing my ass off at the adoption jokes, and I am adopted."
22891,these fuckers are spending our tax dollar's on this shit.... GET FUCKIN REAL
22892,Is it just me or are these banns mostly only in 'Murica?
22893,"this is basically how people think, reffering to #1
""Hmm, it seems the people this guy killed heavily bullied him, publicly humiliated him and ruined his life, and even driving him to try and kill himself a few times-- WHATS THIS? HE LIKED PLAYING A 1ST PERSON SHOOTER?!?!? THE VIDEO GAME DEFINITLY INFLUENCED HIM TO DO THIS! BLAME THE GAME!"""
22894,Bigots in the government and news corporations have been attacking video games since their creation.Half of them don't even understand how the internet works.
22895,All bonker except for 'Battle for Fallujah' - That WAS seriously bad taste.
22896,"Lol @ the media saying women aren't valued for anything other than their sexuality. Is she talking about Mass Effect, or Hollywood? The ladies of Mass Effect (and the men, for that matter) are more developed as characters than so many of the cookie cutter characters Hollywood churns out."
22897,"i like the girl at the end she is speaking sense :-)
Games not kill people Guns and psychos kill people"
22898,Also the video game causing people to do mass murders is stupid. Maybe America should focus on their mental heath instead of blaming video games.
22899,Mortal Kombat was so violent the American game rating system was implemented because of it.
22900,"Except all these controversial games all turned out to have a positive effect on players. It seems being exposed to a certain crime in a software simulation game takes the mystery and romance out of the act, like marriage.
Games got more violent, but violent crime rate have dropped.
There is no bad video game, only bad parenting."
22901,"Pretty much any excuse to shut down a game or ban a game from a country I find to be and pardon my language, retarded as hell. IT. IS. A. GAME!! not real life, not a real life simulator, just a game meant for entertainment or to explain hidden truths. seriously all this game controversy pisses me off so much! Just STFU!! I apologize in advance to anyone I might or have offended with this post."
22902,Dana Plato ???
22903,why should adults have to suffer for whatstupid parents buy for their fucking kids?
22904,"i remember when collumbine happened and the press blamed my fav. band and video game at the time (KMFDM and Doom). It seems like the press (and the rest of the country) cant seem to come to terms with the fact that some people are just born sick. that sickness might not be evil when they're first born, but thru a series of mistakes on the parents and societys half.. they become evil"
22905,"Every time conservatives open their big mouths on video games they lose more young supporters. I used to consider myself conservative, then these social conservatives take over the party and I left. I used to be a supporter of the NRA then they put the blame game on video games and I left them as well.
Social conservatism is and continues to be the bane and death of true Conservatism."
22906,"Hmm, either get rid of every shooter and ignore mental or cognative issues or get games like saints row 3 an E rating. And I'm the one told to look at some other possibilities. And one reason a shooting occurs is the parent showed the killer where the gun was or hid it carelessly"
22907,I actually wonder why GTA is indeed just Mature rating. GTA V for example has full nudity that you see so why isn't it an adults only game? is it just because the ESRB rating system doesn't care as much and because Rockstar just has balls of steel and doesn't care if people sue them or not? What exactly was the fate of all those lawsuits anyway did Rockstar still take a hit from them or did they win it? I don't get why GTA gets harassed more then FPS shooters which basically do the same thing except possibly worse really i mean your just recklessly killing people. I dont get it. Are these people really that ignorant and stupid to the point where they have nothing better to do in their damn lives?
22908,"Most stupid one was when Medal of Honor reboot was releasing and the media had a ball with the fact that one team was named ""Taliban"" and claimed the game was designed with the sole intent of killing American soldiers."
22909,I fucking hate Fox News
22910,FUCK SOCIETY
22911,Why blame games for fucking shootings?! They are just mentally ill people who kill people! Put them in a fucking hospital instead of being fucking lazy and letting people shoot other to fucking make shooting games not exist!
22912,"Screw Jack Thompson. The man is reacting out of blind fear, and playing on the blind fear of others. Video games have actually been proven to have the opposite effect, because it's so much cheaper, easier, and consequence free to kill a digital foe than it is to kill an actual human being, and it's much more ethically acceptable. It's like the person who works out their anger by hitting a punching bag instead of a person."
22913,people are fuckin pussies damn
22914,Omg the Pokemon one made me laugh haha people will find a way to make anything look/sound offensive :P IDIOTS
22915,"how about people stop blaming everything else that's wrong with the people at fault.
""I let my children play violent videogames for days at a time, therefore the game isat fault, not me, the goddamn parent who lets them do whatever they please"""
22916,He liked first person games..... yea. So do millions of other people. Right wing conservative ignorance at it's finest
22917,"You know, the thing is, just because someone loves video games does not mean there is a direct link to their sadistic behavior. People were killing long before video games. Plus that's like saying, so and so loved to read books, and he was reading (insert family friendly book here) the night before he went on a killing spree. Books must turn people into murderers. It's just stupid."
22918,Fucking conservatives!!!
22919,Just a thought on the #1 100% of all mass shooters drank water at some point in their lives so we miggt want to restrict water
22920,DO I EVEN HAVE TO BRING UP JFK RELOADED?
22921,"Fred Thomason, go Fuck Yourself"
22922,"More like Liberal Mojo. Both sides are full of fucking idiots who are oversensitive, But MORE SO the mainstream media as they are the ones trying to appeal to emotion and be ""sensitive"". I'm not even a Republican and this is as clear as night and day."
22923,"I'll be honest, I have played violent videogames since I was a child... I've watched horror movies since I was little... people say videogames are bad for you, but they said the same things about comics when my grandfather was young, its just the human race being unable to accept that they are at fault for something..."
22924,"you missed the alternative version of ocarina of time which has other song in the fire temple cause they were like muslims chants ,the green blood of ganondorf,etc.other stuff you didn't mention call of juarez that is very understimated as well,and mexico's goverment didn't let the game being sold in this country...."
22925,"for years we had movies where we saw people getting killed, they made movies on real war battles too, they are as immoral than videogames, and nobody complain about it"
22926,"I agree with pretty much everyone. Mental health is probably a big ordeal in those criminals who commit mass shootings and yet video games are getting the blowback from it. 
The Six Days in Fallujah game is pretty much the same as CoD. CoD's backdrops include, of course, WWII, the Vietnam War, etc. It's ridiculous. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong."
22927,Some people are so retarded first off mw2 wasn't very realistic and just because manhunt was a video game it got banned yet te hunger games is the same kind of thing and no one thought anything of it
22928,yeah yeah yeah everybody say 'oh my god this game it's soooooooooooooooooooo violent D: burn the creator' but after you see a man or woman that buy a game like dead space to his own son without look at the game itself
22929,"5:10 yeah, i almost lost a loved one in Iraq, and there are tons of Iraq war based games. am I whining about them at all? NO! that lady just wanted to be on TV."
22930,"honestly, fuck the media"
22931,Command & conquer cancelled...
22932,I hate ppl who say vgs ruin kids and by the way if one guy is obssessed with video games and goes on a shooting spree what about the other million who don't go on a shooting spree
22933,I'm surprised that not every Call of Duty game copped a ton of controversy.
22934,Im surprised dantes inferno isnt in this
22935,i live in australia you can stop the release of so called violent games i will just order them from america
22936,Game Theory does a good job explaining the Pokemon race issue.
22937,What pissed me off the most is that they blamed violence on video games
22938,only Americans would shit there pants about video games XD
22939,The mission in CoD you can skip
22940,"So...American soliders ACTUALLY killing people in the middle east, good? Fictional video game characters killing each other...bad? Ahahahahaha. Theyve been putting out violent movies for years too, noone says shit about that though. Fucking idiots."
22941,all the people making the comments are just the biggest F tards ever...
22942,"I am just so sick and tired of people blaming the world's problems on Video games. It is just so stupid, especially since there's been studies that say what a person does in a video game doesn't inspire him or her to go out and do it in real life."
22943,"Blame ""Virtual"" guns!!!! Not Real Ones!!!
hehe"
22944,5:29 look at the COd series and Battle Feild and tell me some thing then.
22945,a game is a game people. it's bad enough we have games like Madhouse and Mortal Kombat.
22946,Commander Shepard needs DOCKING PERMISSION!!!
22947,God damn it conservatives.
22948,"in video game world.. ill shoot ur ass and laugh about it. in real life... HATE guns. ccl people are gonna be able to carry in a bar soon in ohio, and that scares the crap out of me"
22949,Counter StrikeControversies are the best.
22950,"Mass shootings are only ""common"" in countries with lots of guns, seems like deflected blame to me. All counties have Social/Psychopaths; they have been around for a lot longer than the video game industry. Wiki Ivan the Terrible, a king that raped and murdered as a daily routine. There is far too many examples to mention."
22951,game are bad game are killing bla bla bla
22952,You can see why these are contreversial
22953,Ye video games the worlds problems ban them and everyone will be happy and no-one will die! The world will be fine everyone will love each other and not hurt anyone...
22954,hmmm the modern warfare thing is quite edgy
22955,why does government don't make a game lesson to teach child how to control emosion while playing games
22956,LOL pokemon is the devil!!! i played pokemon all my childhood and i turned out fine.
22957,ah Carmageddon good times
22958,Seriously that part in mw2 really made me feel bad
22959,"Whats wrong with making an FPS about real events? That stupid bitch who said ""people lost their children"" of course they did everybody is someones child it doesn't take a fucking rocket scientist to figure something like that out. Peoples children died in WW1, WW2 and every other fucking war to ever have happened in the world, did that stop from people making games and releasing movies. No because people die , if anything these games and movies from these events honor the heroes who fought valiantly to protect what they thought was a FREE country, while back home ignorant politicians are trying to censor game developers from putting out a fucking video game. Apologies for my rant, stupid politicians infuriate me."
22960,i surprised a vs p aint on hear
22961,The reporter is using a Wii... No one uses the Wii idiot
22962,Screw you Fox
22963,such of bunch of bs XDD
22964,Republicans are so dumb. They always want less gun regulation then when there is a school shooting or a mass murder they blame video games.
22965,"Notice how Fox News in behind most of the ""controversies"", fricking right-wing pansies"
22966,"That COD one was my first impression of the whole franchise when I finally rented if after never playing the games. I don't play online anymore, so I was gonna have fun with the Single Player Campaign for a couple hours, cause the game plays well, and send it back to Gamefly. Easy.
I was put off by that sequence, and I play tons of video games, especially violent ones. It was just too much."
22967,"So you say video games, FOX news, we say just for fun. Who do you think is gonna out number you?? The citizens and gamers or the parents and controverts?
."
22968,"yeah because, bad decisions from our politicians, dumb policies, tons of money they steal right from the hands of every citizen, declarations of war, invading other countries, seeing how a movie star earn millions of dollars, but the guy cleaning the streets, working the land with his bare hands only gets 50 bucks a day seems fair and does not cause hatred and encourages violence... yeah must be videogames (and yeah i know my grammar is not the best since is not my native language, and sorry for that trying the best i can)"
22969,"The rating system is there for a REASON. Most games and movies that are rated 'mature', not just for the fact that they are bloody and violent, but because they're hoping you are mature, smart and mentally stable enough to be able to tell the difference between a game and reality. Games DO NOT turn normal people violent. It's the people that have a screw loose, thinking they are invincible and to go on a shooting spree to live out some videogame fantasy.
If they banned mature-rated games, they might as well throw our liberty out the door and burn all the R-rated movies too."
22970,funny that the news media that reports it is Faux News...
22971,Modern Warfare 2 is my favorite call of duty but it even gives you the chance to not play the mission. it warns you twice that is was in fact really bad.
22972,"People try to blame video game as a way out of trouble, yet there have been violent acts with guns and murders well before video game have been around."
22973,"that woman at the end got it spot on, you should only play violent games IF you can distinguish between a game and real life."
22974,If this is a big issue then ban these games
22975,Just don't let your kids play then. that will be just easiler
22976,"All the made me laugh, republicans and christians are really mentally sick animals"
22977,"Note State of decay was edited to get an R 18+
Saint rows IV got edited but banned again after a second edit it was allowed with an MA 15+ under 15s need a parent or legal guardian in order to buy or play MA15+ games"
22978,This is why we can't have nice things. I want to kill babies and pregnant women already.
22979,"Well first of all the lady at the end of the video is correct it has to do with metal problems not video games people just look for a outlet for their anger and hate, sadly the media gives them that by saying this guy who murder five kids and one adult played video games.... oh and we should mention he had a mentaldisease but that doesn't matter now does it right America it is those damn video games. So that is why video games and gamer's are targeted as murders rapist pedophiles... I could go on but it would seem no one wants to look a the real problem which is this countries healthcare and mental hospitals being such down because of funding.... yeah those video games man they'll be the end of us all.... no hope."
22980,"Why do people listen to Republicans?
We all know their stupidity is beyond laughable."
22981,God Fox news is a fucking joke of news channel.
22982,"Yup, still no russian"
22983,"It pisses me off when people try plastering the actions of people with obvious psychological problems on videogames. How about you people take some responsibility for yourselves, and advocate for better psychological resources and better methods of identifying high risk people. Instead of, you know, suggesting that because I pick up a controller, and make pixilated blood fly, that I'm likely to go off on a killing rampage?"
22984,"What I don't get is yes even though people did lose their children in the battle of Fallujah they also lost their children in loved ones in other wars like Vietnam, WWI, and WWII but Their is no controversy over that seeing that there has been multiple games that feature these wars."
22985,"Fox news.
That is all."
22986,shut the hell up if you know that your sons playing rpgs and shooters/killer games hold hold why the fuck should we care as long as they dont have access to a gun dont fucken trip who cares what they play and its called illuminati everyone knows about it but who gives a shit know one wants to sell their soul to the fucken devil so the fuck with these dumb ass controversys he shot the movies up cuz he was eitther tired of fucken life or wanted or had/forced to kill someone in the theatre and pretty sure people know oh that guy in call of duty killed that person i want to go kill somebody now the fuck with that were not that fucken retarded now cmon
22987,Notice how Fox News always seems to be the ones that report it. They always blow this shit out of proportions and make a big deal out of nothing.
22988,I love controversy lol.
22989,the sandy hook shooting as blamed on mass effect since they had the wrong guy for a while.During that time people found that the person who didint do i left a like not a full page of mass effect thing no a like so everyone went to mass effects page to say there game should be banned or they have blood ont ther hands because he loved your game.I hate people now
22990,I honestly believe that it is just a video game and the people who do these things BECAUSE of the video games are retarded and are not the developers fault.
22991,"so if a murderer is addicted shooting games, dont blame the news,media,movies,literature, or real life experiences."
22992,"maybe the government should stop trying to take the easy way out and actually do something to stop shootings. The problem isn't guns or video games, its people with metal diseases and bullies that make people do these crazy things. Bullies drive kids to insanity and make them homicidaland hate people, therefore make them want to kill. The government just doesn't want to take the time and money to help people with mental sicknesses. Maybe obamacare isn't a bad idea after all..."
22993,"I'm never offended by anything ever but when playing MW2 i did feel uncomfortable with the no russian mission, i never killed the people in the beginning 6:00"
22994,"Yeah its the games causing mass shootings, not the ready availability of guns."
22995,"What I really hate is the ""No Russian"" controversy.
The game states, and you can see this in the video, ""Gain Makarov's Trust""
Notice, however, that it in no way, shape, or form, tells you to massacre civilians.
YOU chose to do that, so if you don't like it, don't do it!
I, on the other hand, found it fricking hilarious XD"
22996,bureaucrates can qq me a fucking river
22997,"Yep after playing Pokemon i now have the sudden urge to enslave all animal's.
FUCK YOU PETA And do i really need to say anything about the religion bit? LOL"
22998,i really hate when they ban games (in Australia) i really want.Luckily i got saints row 4
22999,6 days. WHY!!! IF UR GOING 2 DO SOMETHING DO IT AT COD DAMIT!!!
23000,Ahem... how 2 stop mortal combat violence Step 1 go to settings step 1 go to violence control!!!!
23001,"6 days in fallujah getting funding pulled pissed me off. i understand that gold star families lost children, but people that actually fought in fallujah were giving insight. 6 days was a memorial to those who fought, just like medal of honor was. but no, we cant even have that -__-"
23002,Crap my shitty parenting created a mass murderer... wait no it was the xbox's fault.
23003,"The US media are so f*cking retarted and political biased tbh, shit like that gets me really angry at those dumb people who don't have a clue what they're talking about. Ignorance is so common in the States tbh (without offending people who are from the US, I'm well aware that they're not all like that, sad thing is that the majority of them are..)"
23004,"Now I don't buy into the ""video games cause real violence"" nonsense but the ""no russian"" mission was kinda bad taste. Would I say it encourages violence or anything along those lines? Absolutely not but mowing down hundreds of civilians probably isn't helping either"
23005,Wow didn't know about that call of duty one. That one is pretty bad.
23006,I love how GTA knows people are watching it with eagle eyes so they can get offended so they purposefully put in lots of things to 'cause news people to go nuts.
23007,See people take gaming WAY to real. (Sorry but it's true)
23008,About #1 it used to be comic before video games started taking the blame
23009,"They're FREAKIN' VIDEO GAMES!!! Personal responsibility is to blame, not games, not music, not movies. Put the blame where it really belongs; in the hearts and minds of the idiots committing these crimes."
23010,"0:26 For last fucking time guns don't kill people. PEOPLE kill people. And now they're saying video games kill people? I'd be pretty surprised to see an Xbox 360 or a Game CD get up, take a knife, and kill somebody."
23011,Do top snes rpgs!!!
23012,LOL!!!! Pokemon is satanic? Fucking morons.
23013,Most public sex in any video game ever? I wish...
23014,COH2 and Resident Evil 5 are obvious choices.
23015,Why no HD?
23016,"Blame video game companies for all these occurances. 100,000s of kids play call of duty everyday(arguably one if the hottest FPS games of this generation) kids play that game and you don't see kids just saying ""well it's time to go shoot up 300 ppl today"" Most kids don't have access to perform such violent acts and also they're mind is more focused on the video game. People are so stupid these days"
23017,Notice every single news clip was from Fox News I might point out. Also you can't just simply blame a video game for every violent action that occurs in society. The correlation between the two is so far and yet the lazy stupid ignorant media continues to
23018,Medias suck
23019,Any know of Rapelay?
23020,Pokemon..witch craft....uhm wtf .?
23021,Hitler and Stalin play fuck load of violent video games during their time. Just kidding.
23022,so what game did they played that leads to world war 1 and 2 ?
23023,"The Mass Effect story annoys me the most. You have people saying that you play exclusively as a man (Not true) and can have detailed sex with as many women as you want (Not true again) Obviously everyone saying this stuff didn't even bother going into the title screen, where you can choose between a male or female! And quite obviously didn't play to the end of the game, where you get to the optional 10 second grind fest."
23024,WatchMojo is the holographic meatloaf of youtube. Looks very appetizing. 10 minutes later the meal is over and you still haven't had a bite.
23025,"why the fuck do these people blame games for mass shootings
do they blame budweiser for a drunk driver plowing into a crowd no
NO they blame the fuckin person that did it"
23026,LOL no wonder America's going down soon
23027,The press is filled with whiny bitches. What else is new?
23028,"I hate fox. It's not really that they are conservative (I happen to agree with some conservative views). It's that they are so hopelessly biased, that they fail to even CREDIT anything that doesn't fall under their agenda. Yes, games can be violent. The questions isn't that they are, it's how these 10 year olds are being allowed to play them! It's not the developers fault. They just wanted to make something, often to put food on the table."
23029,lol kim
23030,"Some assholes just don't understand that those kids who caused the most recent mass shootings were already mentally unstable as it is. The violent video games may have escalated their insanity, but, they were growing up in unsafe environments, being abused by their parents and being bullied at school. We can't just pin every violent thing a child does on them playing violent video games. Personally, I find violent video games to be very therapeutic. They allow me to take my frustration out on fake people instead of hurting real people."
23031,"What gets me the most about #1 is that the logic behind the argument that games cause mass shooting is inherently flawed. It's the classic ""correlation equals causation"" fallacy. By that same logic, if we find that corn dog sales and temperatures go up in the summer, we can conclude that corn dog sales cause the temperatures to rise. Yet the media still loves this argument..."
23032,Everybody who says First Person Shooters lead to shootings at schools etc. has never played FIFA.... true story
23033,"The gubbenment banning violence, what a hypocrisy, what a larf. But then we wouldnt want the sheep practised in any form of exercise of physical power, no , that is reserved for them and anyone who works for their interests. Its not murder in the military, its financial expansion you idiots!"
23034,#10 you dont have to have a relationship or be a male. (sexist) #9 was there spells in pokemon O.o nah and demons? nope just wild mystical animals/friends and peta says animal abuse? then they must suck at the game
23035,Games should have more warnings like retards with a load of guns and a history of crime and violence don't play this game
23036,always they have to blame the video game. They always have something to bitch and moan about. And the cause for this shootings simple (mental illness)
23037,"fuckin' hate news reports around 'games and guns' they never stop to think ""oh hey, this person's mind was totally fucked up BEFORE they started playing video games... unfortunately it's usually bulling from schools that creates a very introverted person that will usually take to playing video games as a way of escaping the reality of their sanity turning to mush T.T"
23038,POKEMON IS AWSOMES DUMB RETARDS
23039,So that's why number 4 never came out.
23040,i fucking hate Fox News.
23041,How is Pokemon satanic
23042,those rockstar games are pretty out of control like manhunt thats shits pretty graphic
23043,"I found all the hubbub over same-sex romances in Mass Effect 3 and Star Wars: The Old Republic abhorrent.
It's bad enough we have to endure the haters IRL; in the games, it's even easier to not have a relationship with the same gender if you don't want one."
23044,"If you don't like a game or find it offensive, then don't play it. It's simple as that."
23045,I really really don't like that they keep referencing Fox News in this video. Fox News gets butthurt over EVERYTHING. They'd get butthurt over this comment if they could find out about it.
23046,"@5:30 oh shut the fuck up its a video game, they dont take out CoD or Battlefield because real people go to war and die... bullshit bad luck for that company probably would of have a good game too"
23047,The only time Liberals and Conservatives come together is when they want ban video games.
23048,"People want to blame virtual guns because they don't want to admit that we need better gun control. ""You can take mah video games but don't lay a finger on mah gun, you damn hippies!"""
23049,I'm conservative and I love video games if anything it's just pussy politicians in general
23050,Jack thompsons a moron. wHO else agrees!??
23051,Old people are the ignorant ones and then they blame young people for things they cause. Its a vicious cycle.
23052,really pokemon next hing you know there saying mario bros is to gory
23053,Theres always going to be some asshole that has a grudge against something for some reason.....
23054,are u f**** kidding me theres a game were you can replay the columbine shooting by shooting the students dident get pepole pissed off wtf
23055,I don't know anyone who doesn't have fun mindlessly killing people in gta. Even the most innocent people love it. Something is probably wrong with you if you don't have fun doing it.
23056,The only one on here that makes sense as to why it is controversial is modern warfare. Videogame haters can suck a fat one.
23057,People are fucking retarded ! Blaming a video game on a fucking Colombine?????? ! Ugh you conservative and liberal commies make me sick . Show me the link between violent games and mass shooting ?!! Where's the evidence right there is no evidence!
23058,Top 10 games you have to play before you die... That's the title right?
23059,It's funny. Censored Breasts in this Video. Violence and Blood is ok. In Germany are Breasts ok but violence not. (example:Mortal Kombat)
23060,where is bully?
23061,An advocate in Florida who shall not be named xD
23062,"I'm not sure how many people know about this. But not too long after the Sandy Hook School shooting, there was a game released on the computer where you get to play as the killer and shoot up the school. I heard about this game in my science class a least year from a friend of mine, and it pissed me off so fucking much that I literally screamed ""WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE!!!!!"" in the middle of class. I'm not sure if you can find the game anymore. I've never played it, nor will I ever play it if it is still around."
23063,games arent reason for violence they must be sick or stupid to play games beacuse of they want to kill someone etc. and yeah games would be banned for mentally sick people.
23064,video games are as much an art form as paintings hanging in a museum. even MORE work is put into them and half the nation believes them to be an outlet for bloodlust.. if these people saw a fraction of the work that goes into making a video game they would shut the fuck up.
23065,id hate to be the kid of that parent
23066,"This was a real gring flick for me... It's enfuriating how controlling people want to be over what YOU and I CAN and CAN NOT expose ourselves to. But I guess unhealthy minds think alike and sadly are more vocal about their ""concerns""."
23067,six days in fallujah... What a shame. A video game that actually stuck to modern real world history and with collaboration with eye witness accounts of actual soldiers that where in Fallujah. No it could actually teach you something about the horror and truths of war BAN!! It's ok in movies but not video games.. Really wanted to play this game
23068,I think the people that blame mass killings on videos games are dumbasses.
23069,"Imagine how big would the gaming industry be if it wasnt for those Politicians, Religious freaks and old people that think we are still in the 20th century."
23070,And I'm glad that our government had the decency to ban that stupid GTA rip off
23071,I know right before I watch this that somewhere will be GTA
23072,"And i find it extremely hard to believe that something like POKEMOn was so contriversial....if anything, i remember the playing cards were an issue in school because teachers thought kids were gambling lol idiots.."
23073,Im gonna be laughing all the way to the hospital when i hear about someone involved in a mass murder that included ping pong paddles...and then they blame it on ataris PONG :x
23074,"Ahh, Australia. Yeah we really do hate anal probes lol, got rid of those from that new South Park game too."
23075,I lovvveedd all of these games! Controversy sells! There is no such thing as bad press!
23076,"Real people killed as a result of people being killed in video games to date - 0
......."
23077,"People that blame violent acts and mass shootings on video games clearly have no idea what they are talking about. I have played many violent games, GTA, Battlefield, Gears of War, Halo etc, and never once has it entered my mind to go through with such acts as I am committing in the game in real life. I am 18 right now, and i have been playing Halo since it came out 13 years ago in 2001, and have been playing Battlefield since 2003. What I am getting at here is that for 3/4 of my life I have been virtually shooting people and creatures, and I have never thought it would be a good thing to do in real life. I can barely even listen to murder cases on the news because of how messed up it is. It is a thing called common sense. And this is something that I believe needs to be taught and learned. I was taught just after playing Halo for the first time that in real life, people don't wait 3 seconds and then re-spawn, but they are gone for good and will never come back. So if someone is actually thinking about killing people, I'm sorry, but something else is wrong with them mentally (with all do respect)."
23078,"I'm just wondering here, when did a ""video game"" cause mass shootings? To my knowledge when someone does something it is that persons choice to do what they wanted to do. It's so easy to point the finger at something or someone to take the focus off of what really happened. People have been insane LONG before video games came about but go ahead and blame video games/movies/singers for what people choose to do in society. START TAKING BLAME FOR YOUR OWN ACTIONS AND QUIT POINTING YOUR FUCKING FINGERS AT OTHERS SAYING IT'S YOUR FAULT THAT SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED!!!! Some people are just bat shit crazy. Point blank period"
23079,Only one I agree with is the Fallujah one.Not entirely though.
23080,"the COD russia thing was kinda saddening, as i had heard about it but never played it or seen it before. I used to think that its just a video game watevs but now i see why russia banned it."
23081,its funny though causeno russian they allow u to skip xD
23082,"Yeeaa, number 1 reminds me, the next time the news blames video games for crimes, everyone here on the internet should go spam the sh*t out if them with hate because unless some random actually says ""VIDEO GAMES MADE ME DO THIS!"", I will stand by the FACT that games have absolutely no linkage to crime."
23083,why do there hate on the video games when movies could also do it.
23084,You would think a ban on guns would take effect. Even if you ban games murder will still happen. Why because of guns and because of mental health issuea
23085,YOGSCAST KIM!!! I'm like the Yogscast #1 Fan :)
23086,"1:50 - which pokemon version is that?
(sorry for bad english)"
23087,"what mass effect? out of 100s of hours the ""sex"" in mass effect is the last thing i remember"
23088,"People never killed each other before video games, right guys?"
23089,"They should just rename this video ""Top 10 Butthurt Fox News Moments"""
23090,Oh fox news...
23091,"1:33 Sir, I believe you're talking about Hogwarts"
23092,Pretty funny how all the butthurt comes from FOX News
23093,7:29  wtf??? Lmaoooo
23094,No Russian' is my favorite mission COD: MW2
23095,fuck fox news and all of the far right
23096,their just mad cause they are not good at video games :P
23097,3:12 l4d2.. wtf?
23098,"Lol who the fuck are they to blame video games since they havent played them, and if they have, how are they not ""mass killing people because of games."" There is no logic behind this madness. I have played video games for my whole life since i was a small kid, and im still not even thought i would get somehow weird and go kill people because i couldnt recognize virtual reality and real life. Fuck these people."
23099,"Wow, they made that guy look like a total dick for trying to tell the stories of fallen soldiers. ""How dare you glorify my son's life in front of millions of people?!!!"""
23100,"Oh yehh i know, Violent video games are direct links to shootings, yehh okay, i heard military of world war 1 played gta 4 and thats why they were so violent, my bad. Fucking hell, violence is apart of humanity, always has been."
23101,"I don't think they should be blaming video games all the time. They should like at the real reasons behind that. Yes video games can be really violent and for at times no reason just for the bloodshed. Those are the games that may cause this. Sure it might be a way for people to let things out but their other ways for people to let things out. Jogging exercise, friends, music anything. The fact remains video games have a huge influence on our society today, but for most people its just for fun. They will be a part of our society for years to come. These are just my thoughts.
TL;DR Cant blame video games all the time."
23102,#'s 2-5 I can understand. The rest...not so much. I also agree with the lady at the very end of the video. All those shootings in the US that people complain are linked to violent video games fail to recognize that the bigger problem is that the shooters were all mentally unstable.
23103,Pretty Much all of these cotroversies piss me off
23104,"The Mass Effect controversy was the stupidest fukin one ever...
Wait....Dat preacher....The Pokemon was...XDDDD"
23105,What about the one with Medal of Honor (2010) where there was a lot of backlash about actually being able to play as the Taliban (they were even named) in online matches?
23106,"There needs to be a console that only has ""A"" rated games. To get past the bs like this there could be a waver printed with the receipt that the buyer is required to sign saying they are 18+ and take full responsibly of who plays the game. So parents that buy CoD to be a baby sitter while they blow guys in the next room for rock money would be held responsible IF that kid kills someone.
By the way, music, movies, and games have been blamed since the day they came out. How about the crazy concept of blame the offender. At some point it is purely the person who did something fault."
23107,fuckin Conservatives
23108,I hate how they are blaming video games for shootings
23109,thoes people ho do that controversie crap and make developers stop makeing them and band games are all a#@ holes
23110,Everybody who thinks video games make people kill other people is FUCKING STUPID!
23111,"Oh shooter games controversy. I'm guessing there was no murder or mass shootings before pong, since Fox News said it was the game."
23112,"Actually, you can get the PC Version of Manhunt 2 on Amazon now. It's been there for a year or so."
23113,"As a christian, how the fuck can pokemon be satanic?"
23114,red dead redemption is a game that should be on this list
23115,Two words: MORTAL KOMBAT
23116,Kim!!!
23117,"fucking idiots think they know everything. If someone were to commit a genocide, it means they are MENTALLY UNSTABLE, not that  just went out and played a game of cod or GTA."
23118,"If I were to play a game of GTA or COD, I'm not going to just go out and randomly commit a genocidd,"
23119,Multiple face palms
23120,"I am Australian and I like anal probes and I was actually looking forward to saints row 4, and when saints row 4 got pushed back, I flipped my shit all over the place, my shit was just out of the fucking skillet. BUT I GET SO FUCKING ANGRY WHEN PEOPLE SAY THAT VIDEO GAMES AFFECT PEOPLE. SURGEON SIMULATOR DOES NOT MAKE ME A SURGEON, PHEONIX WRIGHT DOES NOT MAKE ME A LAWYER, COOKING MAMA DOES NOT MAKE ME A CHEF, AND THUS GTA OR CALL OF DUTY DOES NOT MAKE ME A FUCKING MURDERER, YOU DON'T SEE PEOPLE DRESSED AS AN ITALIAN PLUMBER RUNNING AROUND TRYING TO EAT FUCKING MUSHROOMS AND STOMPING ON MOLES (exception of youtubers) SO FUCK OFF AND READ UP ON YOUR SCIENCE BITCH, MAYBE ASK YOUR KIDS YOU POMPOUS FUCK CLOWNS! JESUS FUCKING CHRIST, ITS TIME FOR ME TO GO WATCH SAD CAT DIARY OR SAD DOG DIARY JUST TO FUCKING COOL OFF!"
23121,"I can't believe how dumb people are and were about video game violence in the past, it' just seems so stupid for them to think that was ""ultra-violent"" I swear the public is just so blind about things sometimes it pisses me off"
23122,"Just saying. Its not Australia, Its our dumbass Government"
23123,"5 words ""Fuck what the news says"""
23124,Notice how most of the news networksare FOX... YUP that pretty much explains it all.(hint hint)
23125,The only game that crossed the line for me was Manhunt:2 it was fun but sortta gross
23126,"Anyone remember when Mario Party 8 was banned in the U.K. for containing the word ""spastic""? Or when people started noticing that Punch-Out!! was racist?"
23127,"i remember when these controversies came out, my parents didnt believe them and they were right, i played all these games and and yet i dont have a criminal record, or have murdered anyone like the news keep saying, im glad my parents didnt give a fuck the media says about video games because 99.9% of the time it isnt true"
23128,i have the uncesored version of manhunt 2 and 1 on ps2
23129,"I still can't believe that bullshit outrage over a throwaway gag in Portal 2. I saw the report on that, and I just LOVE the way the only used the same three seconds of gameplay to make their retarded point, because showing the scene in its entirety would completely invalidate their bullshit claim."
23130,"God these are all so stupid. If you're going to bitch about a video game, maybe give it a play before you report on it."
23131,PETA are a GENOCIDE CORPORATION AND WORRIES MORE FOR AC4s Whales that real ones thats very stupid
23132,im surprised manhunt 1 wasnt in that list
23133,"when they screwed up manhunt 2 by censoring it it pissed me off, i think if you don't play video games and have never played one you aren't in a position to pass judgment.... i'm telling you, if i made a video game and people were bashing it i'd still release it, because i'll bet it's just the non-gamers complaining and not the actual gamers who will actually be buying copies.... people have the freedom of expression even if it's expression through video games."
23134,"I get that people have lost relatives in the battle of fallujah, but haven't people lost relatives in all wars? So does this then say that we can't make video games based on real battles? I get why the family members are upset but either make these video games or don't make video games about non-fictional battles. Why would only a project on fallujah get canceled and not Sniper ghost Recon 2 which partely took place in Bosnia Herzegovina? Or games about the cold war or other recent conflicts.."
23135,"If video games caused kids to be violent to the extent they say then instead they would be more surprised when a child DIDN'T bring a gun to school. I have played violent games ALL my life and if anything I can say they are a stress reliever. You own someone online, makes you feel good, you feel accomplished. If you have no outlet for that anger/frustration thats when you get these psycho's who take idea's meant to be fun and turn them into acts of immorality. If they want to ban video games for causing people to be violent then the next time someone gets stabbed with a butter knife we should just ban butter. Without the butter there would be no knife right? Makes just as much sense as what the media says about all this. Which is why I laugh at their ignorance. Plus ever noticed the people blaming the video games are never young enough to actually have grown up playing these games? How can you judge something from only what others who are coming from a stubborn view point telling you? In the words of Bill Burr that is like me writing a book for women entitled ""The third trimester and what to expect"". Rant over haha"
23136,"I did a paper about video game violence and how it affects violence in the real world, and all the findings I used for my sources show pretty plainly that as video games get more and more violent, violent crime in the real world is going down. Violence in video games becomes almost like a healthy release for those pent up emotions that cause people to go on murdering sprees. All this anti-video game violence crap is just old fashioned paranoia turning video games into the scapegoat for why your kids go out and commit crimes and an excuse for not actually TALKING to your kids and teaching them about not being violent."
23137,Just because i like the challenge and competition of first person shooters does not mean I'm a raging psychopath who will ultimately shoot in real life.One does not develop mental illness from playing first person shooters. Id like to see what video games they were playing 600+ years ago.
23138,"so although there are tv programs and films that have shootings you turn to a most recent media platform comming out doing the shootings and what dosent help is that most of the mass shootings linked with video games come from america, HARDLY ANY IN THE UK why partly because uk people have brains but partly due to the fact there isnt a gun every five meeters and that whole special needs stuff is a whole load of bs because several people i know who play video games have some special needs of some sort (me included) and the most that we have done is quote lines from the games"
23139,what about pay day
23140,"Although there are some cases, there is no overarching proof that video games lead to violence. What did they blame mass killings and shootings on before video games?"
23141,"Goodness gracious, I dislike FOX!!"
23142,Well I guess I better stop playing video games before I murder someone...
23143,people killing because of games of soo extremely fucking stupid and that if they shot up their school they obviously had mental problems before they started playing cod or bf
23144,haha Australia lol.
23145,very solid list. good job.
23146,"In ""no Russian"" you could pass the level without killing a single civilian,  so it was your decision whether or not you were gonna kill people."
23147,"The COD Airport mission was too much,"
23148,"Politicians, Does a strategy game make me a general? No
Does a game about law make me a lawyer? No
Does a game about Music make me a musician? No.
So why would a FPS game make me a murderer?"
23149,"SHAUN!
SHUAN SHUAN!"
23150,SHAUN
23151,Wow the mortal kombat graphics are laughable now that we have zombie games where you split zombies in half and decapitate them.
23152,I played night trap at my cousins house lol.
23153,"Do people really have nothing better to bitch about? Kids sitting at home shooting fictional characters, yes, fictional characters. Me or my son playing borderlands or payday opening fire on cartoon bandits/cops is just ""horrible"", but when a couple years back, osama bin laden and saddam hussein were killed the entire nation has a hard on about seeing the bodies or watching the deaths no one says a word..... sure they were horrible human being but thats what they were, human beings, not fictional fuckin characters...... take a look in the mirror, all these high and mighty assholes are more blood thirsty than any teen sitting around playing there 360 shooting at aliens or whatever. Please for the love of all that is holy, sit down, shut the fuck up, and please just leave one of the few freedoms we have left the fuck alone. I can subject myself to any type of violence/sex/gore that I want. Damn news media should stick to senators stealing money from the american people, presidents starting wars just cause they can, and when psychos shoot up innocent people try and look into the fact that they were fuckin crazy, not whats on there goddamn game shelf cause i most likely have the same shit sitting in my gaming system and I don't feel the need to kill random people. Jesus, shut the fuck up"
23154,"We just have to wait for older people to die and not have banned games.
''omg u kill americans and u are russian omg so bad''
So what if it was americans killing russian people?It whould be just a fine good game huh?Motherfuckers"
23155,They left of the best THRILL KILL!
23156,
23157,People need to shut the fuck up about video games. Everybody has their choice!
23158,haha Sex Scenes in Mass Effect they must have skipped God Of Wars sex scenes
23159,"I am still dumbfounded to this day that people could still believe in witchcraft and demonic entity, religion is a backward piece of shit that has no basis in reality. It is this medieval mentality and language that has to stop in this modern time."

23162,THE EX-FLORDIA-LAWYER WHO SHALL NOT BE NAMED
23163,"6:23 ""PPL"" lol"
23164,"OKAY, I'M FUCKING SICK OF HEARING THAT! ""Violent video games are the center cause of a mass-shooting."" No, they're caused by a mentally unstable person getting a gun. While it is true that video games show the would-be shooter how to undergo the process of whatever they hope to accomplish, one round of Call of Duty doesn't turn some kid who can't even understand the concept of murder into a bloodthirsty psychopath. I'm just getting fed up with hearing that my TV is going to get me to kill somebody."
23165,"Jeez, this video reminds me how ignorant some people can be, especially non gamers (although some gamers can be the most ignorant, raging about things they don't enjoy so there's that)"
23166,man when roach and ghost where killed it was probably the only ttime i shed a tear in my gaming carerr. (never played final fantasy)
23167,lucky at the end of the video 1 person made sense but how cares about the truth
23168,"At 1:08 anyone else hear a random ""hi"" sound... no? Just me?"
23169,I love how people are so uptight about everything...
23170,"Can we stop referring to ""the press"" and then showing a clip from Fox News? You wouldn't cite ""the press"" and then feature a story in the Weekly World News, would you?"
23171,"media has no idea about games
but they will continue wth the stupidity"
23172,God i cant fucking stand fox news
23173,Rapelay got some bad rep in 2009 I think.
23174,oh my god i totally forgot about the MW2 mission. That escalated quickly.
23175,anyone else see the irony in the fact that the people who blame video games for violence are the ones who lived and fought WW2 and elected governments that openly threatened their rivals with thousands of nuclear weapons?
23176,ahem Postal 2?
23177,"Ok the MW2 massacre of Russians was pretty F*** up but it does not cause violence in people excepting really little kids because they mimic  whatever they see of a ""grown up"" doing also the sandy Hooke shooting the guy was a psycho his mom owned guns but he was once a gain insane so don't blame gaming for violent people it's like blaming food for obese people take it from me I listen to disturbed play call of duty and halo and I'm not runnin around shooting people so don't say all of this crap about violent video games and remember it your choice if you want to play them or let your kids play them"
23178,"Fuck those pricks. Oh violent video games causes violence? So tell us how video games caused wwi , WWII, and other wars previous to both ww?"
23179,"Why do people have so much butthurt over video games? If i was one of the developers, i would be like ""ok, so who the fuck really cares?"""
23180,People with video games don't kill people. People with guns kill people.
23181,What about Jack Thompson ?? the guy who said he would donate money to charity if a game development company made a game where the player kills the president of Rock Star games and then failed to give the money for the charity ...
23182,Lol I miss Fox News' crusade against Mass Effect.
23183,"i have one thing to say to all the people who get offended by video games/movies/tv shows. Y'all niggas are pussies. just turn it off, switch it to another channel and get on with life"
23184,"Why does this keep saying its conservatives that tryto get these games banned or censored? Its obviously not. Huge example, that liberal Hillary Clinton trying to get rid of the second amendment and countless other unconstitutionalthings. But anyway, conservatives (republican)believe in less government control and more powerto the people, where liberals (democrats) want a larger government with greater government influence."
23185,Its just a game OMG!!!!
23186,"reguarding mass effect, There is a woman playable character, for female or male characters to choose besides the male protagonist. There is also men characters who you can have relationships with, both hetero, and homosexually. And lastly there is a female character, that literally kills you when you sleep with her no matter if your playing a male or female character. If you want to talk about making females look like nothing more than sex objects, look to games like the Dead or Alive franchise, or Duke Nukem,"
23187,The christian review of Doom 3 pissed me off...
23188,Notice how it's always Fox News bitching.
23189,"Unfortunately, i think that people blame guns like they blame games."
23190,No Phantasmagoria and Carmageddon only as flash? Please stick to the movies...
23191,"There's a thing going on about a female cop who shot a teen in the chest because she thought he was holding a gun, which in fact was a wii controller."
23192,It's not like murder etc didn't happen before video games.
23193,It is all Fox News...
23194,"Fun fact about the ""no Russian"" scene: you don't ever have to fire your gun during the whole event. If you fire your gun, it's because you've been conditioned, in a way, to assume that you have to. I don't know what that says, if anything, but it's still an interesting point.
(Definitely not trying to disparage video games, just an interesting thing, is all)"
23195,"I agree with the whole story they mentioned for #1.. that was a disgusting grab attempt at using a tragedy to justify censorship of video games when there are have been no concrete links found between real and video game violence, and even the links with the person involved, who had known mental illness, and first person shooters that were claimed were tenuous at best... Carmageddon was just based on the original Death Race 2000... Awesome movie by the way, which did not condone that violence, instead it had a deep message about how it was glorified by a corrupt administration and how people were desensitized to it for the sake of profits and keeping people controlled... In fact the protagonist was determined to end it once and for all... The movie featured David Carradine and Sly Stallone, among others."
23196,the gta 5 one was so bad my dad almost wont let me buy it
23197,"The only one that is shocking to me would be the Modern Warfare 2 one. I don't care shooting people that can kill me, but killing like 30 innocents at the same time? That's just wrong to me... And it's not like gta with those funny ragdolls and where it's fun to just massacre everyone. In MW2, you can ear the screams and everything. It just feels too realistic to be fun. Nice idea to be able to skip the mission tho, because it's just wrong...
Oh, and the last one! This is surely the stupidest game ever made. This is just cruel to even think about making a game about this. The creator must be really creepy or sick, because it's simply inhuman. You don't make a game about a tragedy where a lot of innocent people died. Well, you don't have a soul if you do it and you're a massive douchebag."
23198,notice how fox news is at the center of all the controversy
23199,"Get Paid to Game!! Get easy money every week from home, Learn how to quit your job and Be your own boss by tmorrow morning @ www.onlinepaydayextreme.com"
23200,Video games dont shoot people
23201,Yup I definitely see a bunch of gamers walk into a bar after a match of call of duty and go beat up a biker gang. Yup I see that everyday.
23202,"OH NO, SEX. Children can never find out about that, let's ban it from everything and tell them they'll get hepatitis, aids, and die if they even look at the opposite sex.
Oh america........."
23203,Blood is what mans been spilling since the beginning of our evolution and a video game isn't going to cause that kind of violent behavior. Unless some one has a mental health issue and is a conspiracy nut redneck.
23204,"Game doesn't make people violent, lag does."
23205,"I've played games for nearly 16 years, never once gone to a mall or a school and shot people, games won't make people shoot people, people make people shoot people, they're already emotionally damaged."
23206,"I've watched about 20 WatchMojo ""Controversial etc."" videos in a row now about all mediums (movies, TV, music, video games...) and the recurring themes seem to be: Religious butthurt; Media propaganda derived from fear of sex, and; Ignorance to what ACTUALLY causes violence in real life. Fucking IDIOTS. I played Wolfenstein 3D at 12 and have since played EVERY violent game on this list, and then some. As well as watched porn from an early age. Look, I'm 27, never raped a woman, never murdered anyone (or even inflicted intentional harm, EVER!), nor had the slightest incling to do so. Also, I don't look at women as sexual objects to be ""won"" or ""dominated"", nor do I chase money and fame for self-centered gratification. I love my family, friends, and even strangers alike. So FAUX ""news"", Catholic/Christian/Muslim Churches, government propagandists, and all other IGNORAMUSES not included, hurry up and die! Either kill yourselves, or don't have kids. Peace."
23207,"So video games make people violent apparently? I call complete bs on this. What they are saying time and time again is that video games influence kids to be violent. I think this is complete bull shit cause of one main point, THE GAME DOES NOT MAKE THE DECISION FOR YOU! Each person has his or her own thought pattern and while a game may have some simple events that make you think ""oh my god what if this happened in real life?"" the game isn't the one that is pulling the trigger in the end."
23208,"I hate how everyone thinks that video games are too blame for shootings. No, the people who are the suspects too the shootings usually have mental problems or are just crazy. News networks worry about these games too much. And yes, guns have been around for hundreds of years way before video games were even invented. Don't blame the games!"
23209,"the only game that has ever made me want to hurt someone is Fifa, especially online when somebody scores a shit goal and watches it in every angle on the replays."
23210,"So the falluja game was scraped ""because some people lost their lives"" but movies depicting the holocaust and ww2 and serial killers and shows depicting crimes and cover ups TO BE VIEWED FOR PLEASURE ARE OK??? Im a republican but fox are a bunch of fuck ups whenever it comes to social issues like this or marijuana."
23211,"If playing Call of Duty makes me violent, Does Phoenix Wright make me a lawyer?"
23212,"Man thank you top ten for bringing back some great video game memories. Until I saw this top ten video I forgot about ""Night Trap"" for Sega CD what a classic."
23213,People that blame video games for negative things are just fruitcakes and also you should not say a game promotes satanic worship because that is not true but also satanic worship is not always bad
23214,"You can kill innocent civilians in video games all you want, but as soon as they make a game where they kill some lgbt or feminist, there is going to be a shitstorm"
23215,people are so fucking stupid not to mention most the news casts were done by fox
23216,"My OPINION: on the mass shooting/video game controversy... if virtual guns cause shootings... and war is a shooting essentially... but war is cause by human stupidity... then mass shootings, are caused by the shooters being the most idiotic, and sadistic sons a bitches on the planet."
23217,"They say that video games affect peoples behaviour, but if that's true, I would be running around eating white dots and yelling waka-waka-waka, just like Pac.Man. I think that if a video game makes someone a crazy murder lunatic, it's something wrong with them in the first place."
23218,"You should do Top 10 Video Game Contreversies, like Plotwise"
23219,"Okay, I know very well thatconservatives are NOTperfect, but we can't go blamingone sidefor all the evilsof society, and praising the other side for everything that's good.I will acknowledge the use of Fox News clips here, but I will mention that WatchMojo fails to mention all the opposition video games get from the left. Don't forget former governor Jennifer Granholm, trying to ban the sales of certain games in Michigan for their subject matter as being ""too violent"" for kids. She and Hillary Clinton are both liberal Democrats, part of the party whois notorious for blamingFPS's for mass shootings to gain support for gun control, a goal held almost exclusively by liberals. Not that conservatives and Republicansnever give videogames any crap, but don't forget that it can be just as bad from the other side, and sometimes worse. Let's not to be too one-sided here."
23220,"I wish i could go on the news to tell the idiots who blame games to stfu and to think, they are so fucking stupid, if anyone does something thats crazy like shoot up a school its not the games fault its the parents fault, parents need to teach their kids real life and games are different, i played gta 3 when i was 9, do you see me shooting a hooker and taking her money, no, i knew games and real life were 2 different things."
23221,Honey Boo Boo Photoshopped to Look Like a Supermodel
23222,i like how FOX news is the news channel that heavily goes after video games
23223,"I've been playing video games since I was 5 or 6 years old. Today I'm 25 and I've never even punched a person in the face and I'm quite sociable. These claims about ""violent videogames"" turning people into psychos are hilarious."
23224,3:44 KIM!?! HOLY BALLS!
23225,"They sayed GTA V make you violent, but fuck,
you just take the only examples!
Just a few peoples react like that, stop be fucking idiots medias!"
23226,"Fuck the press.
They always think video games are bad and make you violent.
BULLSHITS."
23227,"I'm sorry, but every time someone tries to blame video games on some of the truly tragic things that happen around the world, i can't help but feel a little insulted. If a kid truly believed it was alright to do whatever it is they do in the video games he plays, he has a lot more wrong with him than his video game habits."
23228,it fells like amaricans are just drama queens
23229,games do not provoke violance 100 years ago when they were fighting with sword and bows there were no fucking video games violance has been and will always be in human nature stupid ppl as well
23230,"GAMES DO NOT MAKE YOU A KILLER FOR THE LAST TIME, PLAYING A SHOOTER WILL NOT MAKE A PERSON PICK UP A GUN AND USE IT; BUT PARENTS AND GROWN UPS ARE SERIOUSLY SO STUPID!"
23231,Surprised that the scandal surrounding Bully wasn't even an honorable mention
23232,its funny theres this shop in australia called eb games (its like Australias Gamestop) they sold Saints Row 4
23233,"Skyrim doesn't make me a wizard.

23248,its fox remember.
23249,"Games don't make people violent, i blame their laggy internet."
23250,(about war ) after seeing farenhight 911 I came out with the notion that war is usually conducted by old assholes who send inbred teens to their doom WAR SUCKS and I wishtheir have more people to assassinatecorruptjerks.
23251,its ok that people are concerned about what their kids are exposed to but geez religious republicans are soooo uneducated. its one thing to talk up a storm but another to bullshit the poor ignorant viewers of un true information. ..... I love being a democrat!!
23252,SR 4 will have the deleted parts in the full package.
23253,"FUCK the government and FUCK the media! I wanna ask them some things: Did you play video games? Are they violent? Does it affect your psychology so that you want to mass murder people?
If the answers are 'Yes', 'Yes', and 'No', THEY'RE FUCKING HYPOCRITES."
23254,Notice how that a lot of these controversies were courteous of Fox News! It's insane that they get to call themselves a news station and covers events fair and balanced when they are actually classified as an entertainment channel who's target audience is the conservative right.
23255,"If the press and/or politicians get involved, the real cause of the situation isn't actually being addressed in most cases."
23256,fuck FOX
23257,Like in the game you are required to put a warning before showing the footage from MW2 mission No Russian. I skipped that mission and always have cus its sickening. You didn't have to show the actual murdering scenes acting as a terrorist but you did anyway. Thanks alot Mojo u probably made me and others physically sick by not complying with the basics of censorship. Your lucky this video isn't flagged or taken down for that.
23258,They all pissed me off! -_- how much of a dumbass can people be
23259,what game is at 3:29
23260,k every time someone theres was a shooting and they just say its because of video games thats bull crap the person has a mental issue not video games
23261,"I knew that MW2 russian scene would make it onto the list, I usually don't care about video game violence, and playing MW2 myself, I felt a bit uncomfortable hearing the pedestrians screaming during the game."
23262,God of War
23263,as an Australian I would just like to say that every game you mentioned as being banned in Australia. we have. get your facts right
23264,i belive mortal kombat should havve been higher along with doom and duke nukum for being blamed the cause of the colombine massicer in colorado
23265,"The Fake media DOES NOT want to discourage violence, in fact they promote it. However, in order to keep people joining the Army the must make war seem Cool. If you were to show the real gore, hardship, pain, monotony, exhaustion, fear, and suffering of war in video games then young men would think twice before joining an army to fight a war just a few old businessmen politicians told us would be a great idea to fight! of course as they stay behind like players while the young men are the video game characters..."
23266,"in your country, bunch of fools decide what you play, what you eat, what you wear? looks like moslim country. In my country, our moron governors banned pokemon series, because one idiot kid, tried to fly like a pokemon from window and died. What a stupid country i have..."
23267,"I love how all these mass shootings all mental illness in common yet the media and the politicians continue to blame guns and video games, anyone else see a problem there?"
23268,"Guns Dont kill people, People kill people with guns."
23269,"Dude, Fox News sucks."
23270,"Pokemon being satanic? wow, people are fucking crazy xD"
23271,"It's people's own fault if they don't look at the rating. Freaking hell, don't blame video games on your kids' violence."
23272,"People need to wake up and realize the U.S. is about 40% gamers! If you took video games off shelves because it has a gun in is, people will get mad. A gun is a gun and a digital gun is a picture on a screen. Crime using guns will not lower if you take away games. If anything it would rise! Nerd and geek uprising!!!!!!!"
23273,People are dumb games for me stop me from wanting to punch some people
23274,People are just stupid saying oh this violent video game is the reason for this school shooting when it probably and most likely was bullying or some other emotional problem
23275,"come on...its a video game, it has no affect on any person. I grew up playing these games, it never affected me. I graduated from high school with honors and is now looking to go into college"
23276,"The funny thing is, torture, murder, terrorism, and all those other horrible things, are based off of reality, BEFORE the game was made"
23277,"Blaming video games for violence makes about as much sense as people blaming guns for a number of violent acts in America (Or anywhere in general). Its not the tools or trinkets that are the problem, its the people holding them. And if people don't want to take responsibility for their own actions, its ultimately the victims and their families who have to suffer."
23278,wtf'
23279,I don't how night trap is so violent
23280,"#1 I say that it is not the gun, but the gunman, how is it the game not the gamer?"
23281,Doom being blamed for Columbine School shooting. It was bulling.
23282,"For people who blame video games for shootings etc I like to respond with ""It is shown that the killer often ate food, ususally 3 times a day or more. This shows food leads to violence."" Maybe the fact the killer played video games is because EVERYONE regularly plays video games..."
23283,That Call of Duty mission is horrific and disgusting. How anyone could get pleasure or entertainment from doing that in a video game makes me concerned for my fellow gamers.
23284,I hate how people always seem to blam violence from video games were the person who commits whatever crime they do are just messed up and need help
23285,I liked all those games I do not understand why saints row was not allowed in Australia but there people believe in the propaganda as much as the eu and usa. People need to stop watching the news you know when you tell a lie you base it off the truth well thats what the news does. I wish I could explain more but question everything Im not saying the news is wrong but its far from unbiased or truthful. Meh its ok we don't need those silly rights or a fair impartial trial. Wow this pissed me off.
23286,I agree with the them making manhunt adults only it's gory not that Id really stress if a kid saw it is say 14-16 range they are good. Screw all of the news they just go on about things they dont know and dont even effect them. Guns video games do not cause people to become killers predisposition to violence perhaps and Im sure our worm open culture helped any of these people feel any more welcome than a lepper. My point is we need to actually find the truth not blame acts of violence ugh!
23287,"I don't have a problem with the violence in video games as long as people are forewarned by the rating (if they don't look, it's their problem), but I have to agree that creating a game on a real life battle where close relatives are still alive is kind of disrespectful....but I suppose, what then about wwII games?"
23288,3:25 what's this game?
23289,Notice how all the coverage and negativity that they show from the media is basically from Fox News. Information from Fox should be taken with a truck full of salt
23290,the pokemon part just cracked me up! peta why don't you focus on real animals not ones on a Gameboy cartridge! and in all honesty who takes games this seriously? video games are a form of relaxation for me and that's all it should be! and btw fox news. stop doing news!!
23291,no Russian was the greatest mission ever
23292,well world at war was a game based on a war
23293,"I personally feel that u make ur own choices, u can play these games and not shoot ppl in real life, its about self control. which some ppl don't have, I think even if they hadn't of palyed the game the shootings still would of happened."
23294,"Notice how this isn't specifically a liberal or conservative issue. More like a pro-freedom versus anti-freedom issue with the ""anti-freedom faction"" (nod to S.T.A.L.K.E.R. right there) being represented by pacifist pansies."
23295,FATALITY
23296,"I think it is funny how blame ""conservative"" media. It is every source of media."
23297,the news are all fucking cunts wish everyone will stop watching them and start getting your news from non main stream media many they will stop lying to us and making up shit on a daily basis
23298,what i dont get is that the american press has blamed games for a lot shootings but there government still hasunt made the link that if in your contrary guns are incredibly easy to buy and yous then the chance of people using those guns to shoot others is bound to increase exponentially now don't get me wrong i like america its far from a bad place but this thing bafels me
23299,"The thing with the mass shootings and all the other fear mongering is that video games are the new kid on the block. It's the newest form of entertainment and people always fear new things. A few years ago it was rap, before then it's the Internet, then rock music, then the hippies, and so on and so on until we get to 10,000 B.C.E. and people are thinking fire and the wheel are satanic and should be banned. And everyone scoffing at the old crazy people for thinking games are evil will be doing the same thing when the new tech of tomorrow comes around. It's a stupid cycle but it's human nature."
23300,The media just brings up videos games as a cause because they want to get people watching and talking.
23301,The controversy on violence in video games presented by Media is because. The media enterprises have nothing better to do so they decide to blame video games or action movies when if you look at it many of those idiots who go around massacring people often have a mental problem or have been bullied as children in other words America Video games don't cause violence .
23302,"Video games do not cause violance I mean if they did then 10,000 years ago they had some good fucking technology and another thing if someone who goes on a killing spree so happens to.have games.with guns then they were already nutjobs to begin with video games did nothing"
23303,i hate this stuff it's just a video game...
23304,The one about how Pokemon is satanic is sooo stupid like seriously what wrong with some religious people? Do they just get bored sometimes and decide they should annoy people?
23305,"She's right, mental illness is a big problem... So then why are news anchors not being blamed for spouting out non-sense about video games that half the time dont really add up to anything but making parents of gun shootings feel better? That is some real mental illness and if I may add, paranoia."
23306,"Stupid news, getting on the cases of the makers of great games! The Fox do we care what they think?"
23307,"like ppl jump to conclusions that video games fuck kids up , they blame companies such as Rockstar,Activision ect. just because they have no other evidence to support it."
23308,"so you lost your funding ..
yeyesbuyeyee (um..)"
23309,"It is absolutely amazing what people tell themselves of something they are so ignorant of and know nothing about. (I'm talking about the news anchors, religious goers, political figures etc.) The only one I can even a little bit understand why people would be upset is the Six Days in Fallujah, due to the fact it was based on actual, recent events."
23310,OH DEAR GOD LMFAO POKEMON IS SANTANIC LMFAO please humanity has been violent toward each other since we invented the spear then the gun then the nuke give me a damn break FAIL TROLLS FAIL
23311,"6:23,look at the captions it says ppl, on live news, oh Fox"
23312,I hate it when video games get blamed for reel life crimes / when I play GTA 5 I don't then go out and rob a bank.
23313,The Garry's One Incident with Total Biscut
23314,"I think a big problem in the US is media, they are obviously doing their best to dumb you guys down as much as possible. Surely those presenters at least have a degree and must think twice about the shit that comes out their mouth."
23315,"The way I see it, if a person decides to copy a video game it's not the game's fault - it's the retard who decided to copy the game's fault."
23316,if some person has a serious mental illness... why the fuck would you let him/her play GTA 5??
23317,people need to know that games create a safe environment to do what we want and don't influence killing
23318,I hate stupid reporters that think video games are bad or demonic
23319,"I'm sorry (maybe it was already mentioned before) but since you have listed banning in Australia why didn't you list banning or low violence versions in Germany? It's just as significant, if not more, purely because of the size of the market."
23320,Fox News are not a credible news source. They're a corporation trying to push a political agenda and forcing people to believe in their ideologies of a 'conservative' life.
23321,Didn't a lot of people's children die in World War II as well? We need to get a bunch of movies and video games banned
23322,"Mass shootings; conservatives blame video games, liberals blame guns, no one blames the shooter."
23323,"The first statement of #10 has to be A) the dumbest thing I have ever heard. or more likely B) This poor bastard has never been laid in his life. ""The game lets players engage in the most realistic sexual acts imaginable."" Yikes dude, I speak for everyone when I say; Having real sex is the most realistic sexual act imaginable. I thank you for the laugh, but god damn dude...Go out into the scary world and get laid!"
23324,the violent rampages that players can go on at will have been garnering negative attention since the series debut yeah because every kid today has automatic access to giant military grade tanks to go on a killing spree with
23325,"I don't understand why six days of\in Fallujah was banned because of many children have died so. I understand GTA because its about lifestyle of a criminal and you kill inoccent  people but its only a game. in Poland we barely have banned games the only one that I know is the manhunt series. Now people can see differences between virtual and reality. Also when I play cod battlefield and left 4 dead 2 I don't go outside and kill people I just tell my friends that for example I have just unlocked a new weapon or I got an achievement or that something. R
Crazy happened"
23326,"Maybe instead of automatically saying, ""Oh shit, video games caused it!"" they should ask better questions like, How did the killer with a known problematic mental history get a high caliber weapon in the first place, or how can we better prevent this problem? But instead they bitch and moan about it and wait for it to happen again knowing damned well they could have stoppedit the second time. Then the problem repeats."
23327,All the news programs in America have problems with games its only a game its not a real simulator
23328,I have an uncensored version of manhunt 2
23329,"Virtual guns kill virtual people, REAL guns kill REAL peolple"
23330,"Nice ppl in 6:22,soooo professional fox."
23331,its a game. if you dont like it dont play it get the hell over it
23332,"Just how fucking stupid can america get compared to other countries, you don't see japan banning games where you fucking blow shit up or anything like that, although they do ban shit, it's not because they think it's ""wrong"" it's because they want people to believe what their government believes."
23333,I feel so sorry for the kids who's parents were nodding in agreement about Pokemon teaching children witchcraft and satanic rituals...
23334,"I really hate the media when it comes to games. They always blow things way out of proportion and make everyone who plays them sound like a mentally disturbed person, and it is SO STUPID."
23335,I hate Midway for being the first vermin to make people addicted to cinematic movie garbage games.
23336,"As a hardcore gamer, even I admit ""No Russian"" in COD was/is horrific and shouldn't have made it in the game considering a lot of dumb parents let their kids play COD. This stuff can rot a young person's brain, seeing extreme violence too early on like that can damage you, whether it be in a video game or on tv, etc..."
23337,Fox News? Wow! Just wow.
23338,I hate peaple that think that vilont games should be banned
23339,hahaha. I studied Night trap last week in class :)
23340,"Fox ""News"" has a problem with everything, all they do is bitch and moan. If it were up to them we'd all be living on plantations reading the bible, married to our sister wives."
23341,"I think it's funny that Australia is strict with games, yet they hosted the Sexpo, the worlds largest sex convention."
23342,"Wow really? That bitch in CNN or pretty much all of them think it should be banned, it is just a game And you are crying children play it? ESRB Ratings parents -_-"
23343,u forgot postal 2
23344,"Okay, people need to stop blaming video games, guns, music and movies. I played Mortal Kombat and I turned out just fine"
23345,Anythingfor ratings.
23346,"As to #1:
if the media bothered to do a little self examination they would realize that the single most violent piece of programming available on television in this country isn't a video game movie book cable TV show or music.
The program in question comes on four times a night at 5,6.10,11 and always features the absolute worst real world acts of viciousness and cruelty as lead ""stories"" while pushing the actual important news events to after the first commercial break, the program in question is the nightly news.
The problem is that stupid people (mostly right wing christians/gun nuts/pro censorship freaks) don't want any real examination of the actual issues behind what happened like the easy availability of guns or the total lack of societal concern for the mentally ill/disturbed we have in this country.
They prefer to blame art because art doesn't have some moron at a pulpit telling them what to think or have an 11 billion dollar industry behind it that is fronted by some of the scummiest lobbyists on K-Street (The NRA) that is constantly duping them into believing every idiotic conspiracy theory about the government wanting to take away their guns/religion."
23347,"They forgot to mention that you can choose to be a female in Mass Effect so it isn't just ""a man deciding how many women they want to be with""."
23348,and the last game
23349,the only games that are really bad are manhunt and mortal kombat.
23350,"i can remember desperately wanting to get my hands on GTA vice city when that first came out, but my parents made it clear that i was never going to get it because they saw it as violent. the only game from this list that i'm glad was banned, and the controversy it caused was justified, is manhunt. it's just sick."
23351,"That mission ""No Russian"" was actually my favorite mission in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. It was the only time where I got to play as the enemy."
23352,"Pokemon is satanic. Anyone who knows the symbols knows this. Get used to it, everything is done by increments. I remember when Double Dragon was a controversy because they punched a girl in the stomach in the beginning of the game. That was nothing compared to what we see today. The ratings also changed. I remember when Friday the 13th came out and it was rated R, now I can watch it on Saturday moring at 10am. But how do you shock someone like me who saw Scarface at 8 years old? Most parents also don't have a clue what's in most games like GTA."
23353,well this proves how retarded our governments are in now way is modern warfare 2 realistic........
23354,pokemon?..... really? -_-
23355,"The only reason everyone blames video games for school shootings is because of the fact that no one wants to admit that the real problem lies within the things that happened to the poor kid that ended up holding the gun.
Yeah lets blame video games instead of addressing the bullying problems in school that no one seems to give a shit about! That makes TOTAL sense!"
23356,"Surely if your going to complain about video games, you should be from this generation. Or at least of spent a long time playing what your complaining about with an open mind."
23357,"look... i know school shootings are horrendous... but how many drunk drivers kill people, alcohol kills a lot more people, smoking kills a lot more people, and heroine kills a lot more people than first person shooting games.... how bout we crack down on that garbage and try cleaning the streets before we try to take fun/fake games off the shelves"
23358,"um honestly... why would battle of fallujah be banned because people died in a war? i guess every Civil War or World War game should be banned as well because it has background and information from specific battles that happened in the wars... I'm sorry that's a stupid reason to not have a game come out... Sure it may push the boundaries, but to think that WAR games are banned because they are based off of battles and wars... that's a little ridiculous. All WAR games should be banned then......"
23359,people will always look to blame something.. and games are easy prey.. these people are so thick its funny
23360,"I can understand one or two of these, Custer's Revenge was a baaad idea, other then that most of these are just a bunch of people bitching cuz they can't keep their noses out of other people's business. cool video."
23361,"This is all so stupid. Just because I play, oh...I don't know...lets say ""Cooking Mama?"" doesn't mean I will be a cannibal. Or playing Okami means I'm against religion. Or saying that Animal Crossing goes against Christianity means it's true because it's bullshit. 
Games are intended to provide enjoyment and amuse the player. If a player takes things with the game too seriously, blame the player! And because there are certain aspects of a game you do not like, doesn't mean your opinion on it is right. 
It's like seeing a man eat a sandwich and saying ""That man can't eat that because I think carbs are bad"" or ""That man can't eat that because the ingredients will make him unhealthy in my opinion."" 
I hate society's like this c:"
23362,"Video games will always get blamed for some form of violence, or ""satanic"" imagery. Especially the imagery part, I find that extremely hilarious.
Now, lets tune in to our local news networks and watch the countless stories on rape, child porn, killings, murder, shootings, war, drugs and oil."
23363,what about splatterhouse ?
23364,"5 should be 1 because its absolutly imfamous every one knows about its incredibly explicit content even my grandmother knows about this and she considers using the tv guide ""to fancy for her"""
23365,I'm guessing Manhunt.....
23366,"News outlets really miss the fact that a lot of games are considered stress relievers. I mean, really, who else loves to go blow stuff up in a video game when they've had a bad day? It's a much healthier method of dealing with stress and anger than, I don't know, actually going on a murder rampage like people seem to believe they cause."
23367,18+ for a reason. Blame the parents.
23368,I can only imagine the writers of this 'article' were unaware of the video game Rule Of Rose.
23369,"News Corporations love to talk out their ass, even when scientific evidence and common sense show otherwise. Nine times out of ten when they get upset over a game, they forget the age rating displays 18 or 16, they then go on to talk about how it harms children. Based on the rating, children should not be playing it. Who's fault is that? Why the parents and guardians. It is their responsibility to raise their children properly and if they don't monitor what their kids are doing then they are not doing their job right. You don't blame the company when the advice is don't give it to children."
23370,you need to control our mind before playing games
23371,jesus christ alot of people complain over nothing it doesnt create serial killers
23372,"People are INCREDIBLY stupid for thinking games like Call Of Duty= Mass Shootings. Well then, why not say Mario Party starts gambling?"
23373,LMAO! Pokemon is satanic. Oh that's hilarious
23374,I was told (since i never played it) that No russian. you dont actually have to kill anyone. It possible to be a witness but not actually shoot anyone. allowing the NPCs to do the work.... so yeah if you choose to murder all the people. that's on you.
23375,I laugh when ever i heard about Night Traps' controversy. because like they said It was flawed. Infact the goal of the game is literally saving the girls. Heck the house is like if in home alone Kevin Mckalister was teenage special effects wizard.
23376,"""Some children lost their children in that battle.""
Never mind the other, insanely high grossing war entertainment games, though, right? Fucking media scumbags."
23377,leave justin bieber alone :D
23378,Anyone ever see a movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger in it? News flash. He was California's Governor. I rest my case.
23379,I am surprised you didn't mention the rape scene in Phantasmagoria... that had a few people pretty angry too.
23380,"There is more violence shown on the fucking news more then anything. And people complain about movies, music or videos games. Because they are two violent. I can understand why call of duty would get some shit because that shit was real and did happen. But at the same time its still just a fucking video game. If someone is gonna do the things that they see in a video game or a movie they are just fucked up in the head period. And people don't take responsibility for there actions"
23381,FUCK THE REPORTERS
23382,"That fucking bitch, talking shit about the Fallujah funding, says ""oh lot people lost their children"" no shit bitch that's war, how about every iteration of WW2 video game thats out there, the virtual re-creations of Pearl Harbor, Siege of Stalingrad, Battle of the Buldge, and Iwo Jima to name a few, or even Vietnam recreations War isn't pretty, but in a virtual reality what you take in is the terror and madness that happens without the fear of the real thing. Your also playing a game to have fun, not in the hopes your gonna walk away with PTSD and think your getting a Congressional Medal of Honor"
23383,"Although I'm not a fan of being a terrorist and shooting innocent 3D pieces of data, everything here pissed me off. They're games and for all I know they don't inspire violence in the young adults playing them. Obviously, the ""controversies"" that made me rage the most were the Pokemon ones..."
23384,"Lol I love how people talk about something they know nothing about. All the people who talk crap about video games, never played any of the games they complain about LOL. Ignorance is bliss"
23385,"just a thought...
Mongol conquest of northern China, over 500000 dead, 13th century.
American Civil War, over 600000 dead, 19th century.
World Wars, about 100 million in total civilians and military deaths, 1914-1918, 1939-1945.
First video-based interactive amusement device (technically the first video game): a modified CRT device, 1947.
First ever shooter: Spacewar, 1961. No graphical violence featured.
First popular arcade video game: Pong, 1972. Also no graphical violence.
First violent video game: Death Race, 1976.
So. Still want to blame human violence and human psychological problems on video games, hmm?
Shame on you, America news. Or specifically, advocates of ""lets stick to conveniently blaming video games cause they were so existent since the dawn of time."""
23386,"whaaaat, why would Australia ban State of Decay, I've played that and it's not that bad. hell see if they survive the zombie apocalypse, they are stunting their young and they will be unprepared for Zday. :P"
23387,what was the guy saying at 5:30?
23388,These video games are slowly evolving into vents for people. Video games continuously move closer to resembling real life in their graphics and revealing the true desire of people. Pretty soon the real world will be accurately put into video game form and you can do anything realistically without consequences. Isn't that what we really want after all?
23389,the person that pissed me off was the bald white guy in a suit
23390,F***ing Democrats.
23391,That bitch at the end of number 4 concerning six days in fallujah fucking pisses me off.does she protest every movie about war? or every fucking game of risk that gets sold? Just because your son died in a war doesn't mean you have the right to not let annnnnyone in the fucking world play any games or enjoy any entertainment that involves war. That's just ridiculous.
23392,I watched a video that GTA5 could actually make you a better person. Take that fox.
23393,Don't censor
23394,"I hate how everyone blames violence on videogames. Like if there wasn't violence, madness and sadism before videogames. They just make us gamers look stupid and socially dangerous"
23395,top ten Kirby copy abilltes
23396,"alright, I think The Fox News (which I love) does take the mass murder-video game thing too far, but my standpoint in the conversation is that violent video games could cause an already damaged person to break. All those tests were to see if Vgames could train you to kill, not cause you to kill, if someone that has PTSD, mentally ill, or at a young age (1-8) plays very violent games like GTA, they could go insane and go on a mass shooting. Im twelve and I'm not aloud to play GTA, but am aloud to play CoD because your goal is to help your country not kill innocent people like GTA althoough I'd love to play GTA i understand and respect my mom's concern. I think the BIGGEST deal is parents letting their 5 year old kids play Cod without telling them that killing is wrong, but I think GTA should be completely off limits until their parents think they are ready, but parents today are lazy as hell. If I talk back to my mother she'll smack me and she knows how to smack!"
23397,I hate when people blame video games for everything wrong In the world.

23400,"Hey, Yogscast :D"
23401,"video games aren't really that bad...i will agree they might have something to do with a lot of violence and everything, however think about it....how much deaths and pointless fights religion made? yaaa..compared to that video games aren't that bad."
23402,If video games had no violence no one would play any games whatsoever

23406,"What the hell is wrong with that game about Fallujah? Based on a real event where people lost lives... SO you can't use it? What about D-Day, the Blitz, Vietnam? How often have THOSE been exploited in movies and games...? :/"
23407,"computer games??? what about america's gun laws and gun culture??? very rarely, maybe once or twice have i heard of a high school shooting happening outside of america,where as in america it seems to becoming more frequent."

23411,Australia is missing out.
23412,666 dislikes.... lol :3
23413,THE WAY HOW VIDEO GAMES INDUCE VIOLENCE IN PEOPLE IS ONLY FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REALITY AND VIRTUAL REALITY. there is a kid at my school who is acting like a hard criminal and he goes around the school threatening other students about killing them or raping them. he then blames it on playing GTA V. he won't get in trouble with the teachers or the office because they think his autism is an excuse for for all the physical and emotional harm he has caused to many..... i fucking hate people like that...
23414,Just another way for the U.S. to put the blame for what's wrong on things that we do in our free time. Oh I played a game where my character used a gun so I'm gonna shoot up a school. Logic at its finest.

23420,"I would love to see the Video Game that inspired all the wars before the creation of the first gaming console. There are many terrible instances of mass killings and violence in our history. Humans kill each other, it's in our nature. People need to accept that and stop playing the blame game."
23421,"The United States of America: Where is horrible that kids play with virtual guns, but it's just fine that they play with real loaded guns."
23422,video games lead to violence!!! biggest lie I've ever heard...
23423,you miss Postal
23424,It's not the vid games that causes mass killings.  It's the person holding it
23425,"Austrailia sounds like a shitty place to be a gamer. Video games are like R rated movies and porn, just be mature enough to watch/play it and make sure little kids stay away from the bad stuff."
23426,"I blame early 90's gangsta rap !
Its the kids who listened to that stuff who are now creating games like GTA V.
What a fuckin awesome age we live in, the world might well be fucked but boy am i entertained

23427,"I don't know why the people mix Sex, that is something that everybody does or will do (if you know what is good for you) once in your life! And they describe here like it's a sin or it's demoralising the woman (as if they don't like it!) and mix with Mass murder, violence, creepy gore?
I honestly don't think this violent games do any good for anybody other than bring the anger and hate out of you, pleasure in killing???? How stupid that can be!!! The result of these kind of stuff is electric chair bro!
But why do they mix it with sex I still don't know? Does the society still think that sex is a sin? Like in the dark ages? How long does it going to take tip we have some evolution in our thought?"
23428,They're fucking video games they don't cause people to do shit get over it politician pussies
23429,All of them pisses me off
23430,Well the government is a stupid thing
23431,"Yeah, let's blame all the world's violence on video games. It's not like people have been murdering each other since the dawn of time."
23432,"I never understood why people blame video games for anything violent that happens such as a shooting. I've played games like Call of Duty, Devil May Cry, Left 4 Dead 2 and other games and not once have i felt the urge to go shoot up a building or run someone over. I never had a problem with the ""No Russian"" mission either. I played it, and shot the people but i didn't feel the urge to go kill someone.
Video Games are entertainment. Some of the entertainment in some video games is questionable but the majority of games are still meant to be entertainment."
23433,"To tell the truth, I just believe people are taking these opinions a bit too far. Play the games or not, all of it is a simulation. To do the things you cannot do in real life. It is a videogame, one person can see it as a stress reliever or a mass topic. I play if for fun."

23447,There has always been shootings all over the world way before video games but know they have something to blame it on i wonder what they would blame it on if there werent any video games
23448,we know that the shootings were tragic but did you know that all those people drank water?
23449,The pokemon one annoyed me alot
23450,parents cant complain if they would keep their kids playing their correctly rated games the adults just make them selves look un-prepared to raise a child (just my examination of the situation)

23457,"The only thing I found to be truly controversial was when PSN accounts were compromised, causing player loss of money, everything else are just pointless witch hunts and blamegames."

23460,"Gun violence was around before video games, and would still be around if there weren't any video games"
23461,"And don't blame the second amendment for some unstable, trigger-happy jackass killing scores of people. You blame the background, not the immediate solution."
23462,Parents like to jump the gun and blame video games rather than the abuse and terrible genes they bestow their children.
23463,pulling the funds from six days in fallujah is the one i find too stupid to belive... dont take this too litteral but its like saying we shouldn't teach history because people have died. Im interested in politics behind wars and warstories/histoy and would have loved to play the game if it was historicly correct
23464,Great blame all violent video games for real life violence.Wat about these violent movies on tv huh.Wat about the porn they show on tv.Not censored or anything.yet u blame it on video games.These ppl who blame this on video games r fuking retarded. Hell I just watch kill bill and there was tons of blood and gore(no offense to killbill I luv that movie) yea u should worry about that
23465,I think I own Manhunt 2
23466,"So the theme here is people think that video games are real and censorship is the answer to everything. I am going to say something controversial here if you don't like the game don't buy it for your kids or yourself. I can completely understand why some people find these video games offensive and abhorrent but instead of acting like an adult and simply not buying the game which is their choice they want to remove that choice from other people. If people want to ""poison their minds"" why should you care? They are presumably adults who should be capable of thinking for themselves. If someone sees a volatile video game and considers it a piece of art or entertainment that they want to own why would that effect you in anyway? You don't have to see it, play it, or have anything to do with it. Simply banning something because you find it offensive is just being condescending and treating other people like children while shoving your own brand of morality down their throats with out giving people a choice. Some people might take the ""Slippery Slope Argument"" but I think we can all agree that it's a poorly constructed fallacy and letting people play violent video games isn't going to cause them to go run over hookers and blow up buildings. Anyway this was a long ass rant against censorship, if you feel differently let me know why I am always curious to here the other side of an issue."
23467,Fox News are assholes
23468,of course every tv report was fox news.

23471,I have manhut and it isn't brutal.
23472,omg its a GAME jeesus
23473,I love how fox news is the main problem here...
23474,why is it that people (especially conservatives) always try to demonize and limit video games...or any sort of media that go against their (conservative) views.....often blaming video games for violence in society.....yet if you ask them to change laws to ban or limit a citizens ability to actually get a actual firearm....or ask them to increase funding for people with mental health....they cry about how unfair that is and how you cant blame guns for some nut going into a school and firing off rounds...or how there are more important things to fund?
23475,Mental Illness and Gun Control are bigger issues than Video Games will ever be.
23476,"So in America, they would rather ban or control violent games for fear it might influence and corrupt someones mind rather than ban or control firearms?"
23477,all ppl from news are retards...
23478,lame lol
23479,Gta 5 controversy stupid a 8 year old playing the game won't teach them how to carry a 30 pound wrench or rip out the teeth of 26 year old man ):
23480,"Fuck these guys. What is the difference between movies and books about famous battles, and games based on famous battles?
Fuck the media"
23481,"As far as playing games leads to mass shootings, if a person cant tell the difference between reality and virtual reality the they  shouldnt  have access to them and that responsibility should fall to the individual,their family and the people surrounding them to prevent any violent reactions from occurring"
23482,"Meh good old retards who say everything is offensive just need to shut-up and run off to their corners and cry...I am tired of hearing dumbass controversy over video-games. Guess what they are fun, so make them to where they stay fun, violence, sex whatever else they wanna throw in let them. It's called entertainment...Stop taking shit you see so literal folks, and we'll be cool, and able to keep having fun in the virtual aspect of our lives."

23487,3:25 What game is that?
23488,"Another problem with people's anger over the ""No Russian"" level is that you don't have to fire a single shoot at any innocents if you don't want to. The other terrorists will not care. You WILL have to fight the police who will show up, but yeah, you don't need to be evil should you decide not to. And as they covered, you are perfectly free to skip the whole thing and continue without it. I love when people have a choice and they STILL get bent out of shape."
23489,"Fuck Australia's rating system. Shout out to region coding being removed though, just another reason for me to not buy from Australian stores."
23490,I get GTA but cod? I'm amazing at cod and I don't wanna get near a gun in real life. Those ppl that do the shootings were tought by their parents and were mentally retarded
23491,im gonna create a game where your a bear and you slaughter peta members for being stupid and thin skinned then you have a bonus mission wipe out all the liberals
23492,Doom. First one to irk so many people with the ideal that games would inspire shooting frenzies.
23493,"We all know videos games promote violence, if it weren't for video games, WWII, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq, and countless other wars and killings in history would never of happened!"
23494,Its amazing how some people are so stupid as to believe video games damage people... they have done scientific tests disproving this many times.
23495,"The lady at 8:39 was spot on. I'm living in Australia and people can play GTA at their own wish. But how come there's no such shooting like America? There are lot more issues beyond one single video game. How about the NRA? How about raising up a gun and said ""from my cold dead hand""? NRA lobbied the government for years for granting easy access to the assault rifle. Who needs those rifle to guard their home? ""Bowling for Columbine"" was an absolute spot on documentary movie."
23496,??? Where is Postal ??
23497,Millions die fighting over religion (bitching contest over who's religion has the biggest dick basically) no one bats an eyelid. Some degenerate goes on a hit & run who just so happened to be playing gta earlier and everyone loses their fucking minds.

23506,Fox news wants you to be a religious robot. FACT!
23507,i got pissed of the last one cuz how the fuck is a fucking 10 year old is supposed to know how to load a gun and shoot it and if the stupid news really see who plays they cod or bf or any fps game they will shut the fuck up

23509,"Having been playing Saints Row 2 for the last two months, I can honestly say, I LOVE randomly destroying random things. And stealing cars. And the only thing I can say bad about it, is I'll see a car in reality and think ""I could make s couple thousand at the Chop Shop."" I don't find myself going to the mall and killing people, or actually stealing cars, and blowing up everything in site, or killing cops. But then, no one knows what kind of minds are playing these games. But seriously, stop BLAMING the games. People kill people, not video games. In fact, its a great way to vent your anger. I feel all calm after playing video games where I kill things."
23510,"EVERYONE PLAYS GAMES, for fucks sake, why do people instantly blame massacres on gamers, its a very large, industry, chances are that he has played video games, I think its sick that politicians push their bullshit agendas using people who died"

At an age like myself being 14, I play games like this and know ""Crap like this isn't something I myself or anyone else would WANT or NEED to accomplish unless they wanna screw up their life."" It's just so irresponsible to see kids with Poor education or Poor minds have parents that LET them play these things. Just Sad."

23514,hey wait a second! ive played custards revege and i have YET to rape 8bit indians!!!
23515,Ugggg Fox News stay away from my video games.
23516,So when is the press going to start bitching about movies? Why the fuck do they get a free pass?
23517,"i like how he said conservatives can be part to blame, and then prior to that he mentioned hillary clinton's name... and shes liberal. the point i make is it has nothing to do with political views but everything to do with peoples opinions."
23518,It always gets me that the people who blame video games for real-world violence are the very people who NEVER play video games and therefore have absolutely no idea what they're talking about.
23519,"thousands of games based on ww2 no one bats a eyelid 1 game made about the battle of fallujah and everyone loses their freaking minds, what bogus bs."
23520,And yet FOX. Is always complaining. Not cbs or abc news. But FOX.
23521,I think people forget that there was violence before video games...
23522,"Video games don't make us violent, people thinking that they do makes us violent"
23523,"the only thing i don't like is the fact that if one guy dose something like shoot up half a town, then people like me and my friends and millions of people that play games are now all the enemy, but on the other hand i do thing that some scenes in games such as the airport scene in COD and a few others are going a little to far, but we always have to remember that if that scene was in a movie no one would care, as a example ""Saving Private Ryan"" a movie that showed the most horrible parts of war in grate detail. it has fantastic reviews from critics and film goers alike, saying it was a grate movie, now if that movie was a video game... it would have been shunned by the media as a training ground for mass murder, i don't know. i guess the moral of the story is that double standers are ok you are not getting hurt, but my friends and i have been hurt by people yelling at us about if we play video games we will end up on the news after killing a lot of people, and just so you know if you watch my videos on my channel yes some of the are shooter but most of the games i play are indie titles like fez, proteus, mirror moon EP, walk, bosonX, and others so don't tell me that i am a bad man who wants to kill."
23524,Bad parenting in the 1800's led to genocide. So parents buck up and need to parent their kids if they don't want really violent games. You're the one who gets a paycheck you scapegoating bastards.
23525,something i dont understand is that just because someone plays a first person shooter doesn't mean that it was the soul cause of the shooting. almost everyone with the ability to play video games plays some kind of first person shooter. its absolutely rediculous to say that they did this because of a video game without having some prior or current psychological problem.
23526,"IS the Manhunt series really . . . . . THAT Bad?
I've honestly never seen it sold anywhere."
23527,"I play horror games and shooters etc. But 5:55, that's just creepy. I don't know why it shocked me so much."
23528,who cares i dont care what the stupid press says about our fun if we wanna kill a bunch of people in a video game we r not ganna b stopped and were gonna do it like comment 2 agree
23529,"as the woman said in the last seconds of this video:
""MENTAL ILLNESS""
is the issue, not games.
no social and clear thinking person who play's videogames would murder other people form no reason. and not every murderer played videogames..."
23530,...... really .. these people who accuse video games are dumb ... I've played multiple video games such as call of duty halo Gta ect. and never have I wanted to go to a Russian airport and just murder everybody ... nor run outside and just beat the shit out of a hooker ... or run people over in a car ... because I saw it in a video game and liked it ..
23531,"reporter are just complete idiots its how you handle the gamementally, age has nothing to with it you can have a30 oldshoot up a bunch of hookers because he wants to know how it feels and have a 16 old play it without a problem it the person not the game come onfox get your facts straight just this once"
23532,"I had to do a persuasive essay on why video games are a positive influence on teenagers. I came up with articles upon articles stating that video games promote hand eye coordination, problem solving, and teamwork skills, as well as several articles scientifically proving that video games can sharpen the skills needed to perform delicate surgery. Doctors who play video games I think are 30% more accurate than non gamers.
Also, video gaming rewires the brain so that people who play do not rely completely on their prefrontal cortex, which improves hand eye coordination, and that carries over to every day tasks."
23533,"Well.. The commentator definitely made it apparent which side of the political spectrum he sits on. Why don't you call this You Tube video ""Top 10 video controversies if you're a liberal."""
23534,Some people need to lighten the fuck up
23535,i thought thrill kill would of made the list
23536,"Oh, FOX, you never cease to amuse me."
23537,"The ""Six Days in Fallujah"" arguement was bullshit. People lost their lives in World War II, but I don't see anyone protesting Call of Duty, or Red Orchestra. A game that mocks the battle would be one thing, but if the devs were doing research, and brought in real Marines to help them tell the story correctly, then how in the hell is that disrespectful?"
23538,"Really theissue at the heart of the matter is, can you differentiate between reality and fantasy. And if you can, then you will have no problems playing any video game, no matter how violent.And if you can't, then you already have some pretty serious problems before you even turn on the game."
23539,"Assholes with guns kill people,not assholes with videogames."
23540,"i hate how people get all worked up about video game violence but its perfectly fine for movies and tv. that lady in this clip who said her son died so they shouldn't make a game about it or whatever should take a look at home many video games as well as movies, tv shows, books, etc. have been made on the subject of war, including real wars like world war 2 and the cold war. tons of people died in those wars but its ok as long as steven speilberg made it? go back to the hole you crawled out of lady"
23541,Flappy birds should be here xD
23542,"OK FOR THE RECORD.THERE IS A PATTERN HERE.ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT THE MEDIA COMPLAINS ABOUT IS BECAUSE ITS JUST SO DAMN POPULAR THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE UP SOMETHING ABOUT IT JUST TO MAKE IT GO AWAY.AND THAT'S EVERYTHING GTA,POKEMON,YUGIO,TV SHOWS,FOOD,AND EVEN RATING SYSTEMS HAVE TO ALL BE MESSED WITH WHEN EVER THESE FUCKTARDS FEEL LIKE IT.AND NOW THAT IS WHAT PISSES ME OFF.THEY HATE SOMETHING JUST SO THEY CAN GET RID OF IT."
23543,"The people playing the games is guilty, not the games. If the person copies the things that he does in the games, he is the guilty one because he did the decission of copying the video game. The video game didn't said to him directly and neither indirectly: Kill people and don't feel bad about it. I have played video games since 5 or 4 years old and I'm actually a good person. And I don't even play CoD or any shooter where you kill people. And if that we're true, the theory would apply too on movies and tv shows because they show the same things as video games. And even worse. So take that fucking haters of gamin."
23544,Its just a video game. Its not real. Apparently people fail to understand that.
23545,"Cooper Lawrence writing five shitty book doesn't make her an author. More of a hack, really. She's not even on Wikipedia!"
23546,"I'm a proud videogame player since childhood, I began when arcade games were still a normal view and entertainment along with pinballs and the first portable consoles and here I am: I never killed anyone but still I played GTA, Mortal Kombat and other violent games; I have never killed or mistreated a single animal even if I played Pokemon games and most important I managed to build a life between the time spent on theese games by reading, studying, meeting people and working. Games are not ""evil"" but people who plays them sometimes is a little weak and get themselves too influenced by games, so do not ban videogames, just think reallywell at what you're playing and when you turn off your console/pcleave the game in his game world and just live your real life! ;)"
23547,3:43 Yogscast Kim! Yay!
23548,"humans are violent creature by nature. i think video games make a great use of that, keeping the violence in the game and not bringing it to real life acts"
23549,"Oh fox news... ""Some people lost their children in that battle.""
Yes, nobody died in WW2 or Vietnam though, so its okay to mass produce games based on those wars without any controversy whatsoever. Yup, no hypocrisy there."
23550,"4:30 a whole 200 peoples parents can say ""hey, im too old to play that game anyway."" so they cut it. i wish they made a horrible place for smug people to go call it USA for united states of assholes. these domesticated smug bastards can argue all day over what they cant do, and say their free. btw guns kill people. exactly like forks make people get fat."
23551,"He Who Shall Not Be Named and that guy in Florida that shall not be named... apt comparison. Unfortunately, because of the Florida jerk, I STILL get into arguments with ignorant people who blame video games on violence."
23552,"I just don't get why people think video games are the cause for these shootings, wouldn't it be more logical to question how and where they get the firearms from?"
23553,So I guess women getting beaten up in Grand Theft Auto wasn't controversial enough to make the list?
23554,"I don't fucking care if you are getting paid to say it or not: VIDEO GAMES. DO. NOT. CAUSE. VIOLENCE. I have played video games since I was five years old and I have NEVER even thought about killing a human being. Hell, I can't even stand the thought of killing an animal. Saying video games cause violence is like saying guns kill people or pencils misspell words. Uh, no? Who is the one behind the gun pulling the trigger or holding the pencil? Exactly..."
23555,There is no way to no that all the terrible things people do are because of influence from (violent) video games. To me this video game causes murder Hate-Train is bull.
23556,also its not the gun that pulls its on trigger its the man they cant blame games
23557,i think the government should stfu its just a game people should stop crying its a game about usually winning in the end so the government really should say out of our shit
23558,"Lol. ""The press"". Implying Faux News is actual news."
23559,So it's fine to make films about real events but god forbid someone was going to make a game about it
23560,"Look at number 4. The women said ""my son didnt have a choice"" no one forced him to sign up for the army. And war games are good and a great way to realise how war is in the world. What a stupid bitch"
23561,Did anyone else notice that most of the press complaints were Fox news?
23562,"a story that pissed me off, that 8 year old kid that played grand theft auto then shot his grandmother in the face. the media ran with that shit saying how the game made him do it and how it should be banned because is causes real violence.
first and most importantly, why did that 8 year old have access to a real gun?
and secondly what retard parents got their 8 year old kid an R rated game."
23563,I'm so happy for living in a country without censorship and be able to walk freely without getting killed.
23564,"Whenever some religious nut tries to tell me that video game violence is the reason for real violence, I always point to the bible and say, ""EXPLAIN THAT!"""
23565,"I dont see why parents and people make a big deal about shooters, Gta, ect. Anyone in the right mind wouldnt think about shooting people, raping women, bombing people. Although If your kid has autism or anything like a disformity i would advise not to let them play."
23566,Thrill Kill... it was even banned
23567,"The people that blame video games on these mass shootings are fucking stupid, they don't know shit about gaming and video games, first of all unless you're not a total fucking psycho to begin with you shouldn't be affected in that way so you go out and kill people (wich is super horrible), video games ain't the problem, it's the people that blame video games on these horrible shootings and all that, i get so angry at people blaming video games."
23568,"Ppl need to SHUT the FUCK UP!! It takes A LOT for someone to kill someone, ESPECIALLY, SEVERAL ppl! It depends on how easy it is too get weapons, which in usa is ridiculously easy! Then the person, the persons mental state, the suroundings and ppl, and MUCH MORE! If your kid kills a lot of ppl, because he/she played a game or watched a movie, there was something SERIOUSLY wrong with your kid, BEFORE playing that game/watching that video, as SANE ppl, don't just start killing ppl, because they played a game, or watched a movie!! How about doing some fucking PARENTING??!! If your kid is underage or violent or have some sort of mental condition, or something that might not go too well with what your kid has, then DON'T LET YOUR KID PLAY OR DO THAT!! Get of your ass, stop blaming bad stuff on something you don't like, or don't care for, and start watching your kid! Humans are NATURALY violent, and that is why we like too play violent games! And, isn't it better that they get out there anger trough killing things in GAMES than in REAL LIFE??!"
23569,I got so happy when i saw that last woman :D
23570,This just makes me want to kill people
23571,Fuck the press
23572,"yawn jeezus, could you have made it any less controversial or interesting?"
23573,why do they keep blaming video games? a normal kid isn't going to go outside after playing grand theft auto and say I am going to murder 20 people yay! only a psychotic kid would do that.
23574,"I never understood the mind set of people who blame video games for violence. There is a rating system that is even shown in this video and parents are the ones held responsible if a child is going to get their hands on a video game THAT WAS NOT INTENDED FOR THEM (I wish there was a bold option so I can emphasize the importance of that sentence). Not only that, even if they did get their hands on a violent game It is highly unlikely that they will mimic what they play."
23575,Just from 35 years of playing video games I can say its all BS. TV is more likely to influence than a video game as believe it or not we gamers can tell the difference between real and not real. This is just my opinion based off of 35 years of playing video games.
23576,I hate the media I reallydo.. Especially because these guys who have no bloody idea what they are talking about think they can just go attacking any old thing. A mass shooting just happened lets blame video games even though there is numerous studies against it.
23577,There are no words to that describe how absolutely STUPID people can be. It's mind boggling.
23578,"Yeah!
But when the vast majority of videogames consist of you saving the fucking world of terrorists, monsters etc. and being a fucking symbol of human strenght and sacrifice yourself for the greater good media doesnt say shit.
Fuck all of this old people and their closed, conservative,retarded and wrong statements."
23579,"When are all this useless, confused and full of crap grandpas are going to fucking leave this world :(
Loses faith in media directed by +50 year old people"
23580,these stupid fucking news reporters and shit... ITS A FUCKING GAME GET OVER YOURSELVES
23581,"i figured like main banned games would have been on here ""manhunt 1"", ""rapelay"" shit like that but good list"
23582,Games will only affect u IRL if u let them don'tif only news networks will get this into their skulls
23583,"Make a game about humans shooting aliens with guns and it's okay.
Make a game about humans shooting other human, and people lose their minds."
23584,thank you for clearing that up people don't under stand it is the persons choice not the game or the gun
23585,"What I've learned over the years about games/movies If its popular, people want to complain. Nothing to complain about? Make something up."
23586,"Kill the hooker, get your money back"
23587,"Have the press though at least once that maybe, just MAYBE, violent games actually help violent people to have a place to safely drain their hatred in the game instead of in real life?  Well this countdown shows just how stupid people can be jyst to be on tv."
23588,"Despite multiple scientific studies disputing the claim, it seems that virtual guns are always to blame. There you have it folks. That's why our government is a joke. Accountability no longer exists because we have morons in office who insist on making decisions based on their view of morality rather than reality. That's probably why we still have under god in our pledge of allegiance despite the supposed ""separation of church and state"". You know, if these morons spent half the time looking into what ACTUALLY causes these violent rampages, like physiological disorders, I bet we'd be able to prevent more of these tragedies. But I suppose it's easier for a bunch of blowhards in suits to blame video games than to actually comprehend the science behind it."
23589,Mortal Kombat should have been #1
23590,Its always Fox News that starts the hype
23591,6:00-genocide
23592,"The one that pisses me off the most was your #1...I have given countless speeches on why video games do not cause violence in our youth and people in general. These speeches have always been backed up with the facts, yet it is still such a huge issue. Video games are here to stay and yes they will always be violent, but that does not mean we have to blame them for everything bad. I remember getting really excited for the Six Days in Fallujah and I'm still sad it never came out!"
23593,"Pokemon? Really?
WT Fuck is wrong with this world."
23594,How was BMXXXX not mentioned?
23595,"i remember the first time i played ""no russian,"" i can't sleep for a couple days..."
23596,this was a good video
23597,STOP BLAMING VIDEO GAMES FOR MASS MURDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is not the games fault it is the incompetence of the parents of the murders who never seemed to mention NOT TO SHOOT A GUN AT ANYONE. Also make a law that when a civilian purchases a firearm they should do a medical background check to find any Brain disorders that could lead to the shooting also congress just shut up and stop complaining.
23598,"so many people wanna blame inanimate objects ( movies, video games, guns) for the incompetent actions of a bunch fucking losers. here's a great idea, blame the fucking piece of shit that pulls the trigger at the school yard, not the music, nor the video games, and not the gun, just the fuck wad that decided to commit the crime."
23599,Bulletstorm might make you a rapist.' Google it lmfao. It's a real article.
23600,Notice how it is mostly the US covered here?
23601,"Mental illness is a big problem, that is called Democrats and liberals"
23602,"It just shows how damned stupid and shallow this world is. I've actually played Mass Effect 3, and it is a very morally engaging game. It is of the genre of art that is not unlike those ""choose your own adventure"" books from childhood, which when at their best required the read to make MORAL decisions (though it didn't always spell those out). 
But beyond this, and that the ""sex scenes"" were less suggestive or detailed than a PG-17 movie, the statement that the games sexuality emphasized merely a male perspective is utterly in error. The game itself could be played from either a MALE OR A FEMALE protagonist's standpoint. But these morons got paid to get so much screen time spouting off their ignorance. And the peasants bought it up and gobbled it down, as usual.
So, did Alice eat mushrooms to IN TO, or OUT OF the fake world, and is wonderland a place of fantasy, or is this poor excuse for a world the fantasy, and the REAL WORLD the wonderful Heaven that awaits only the Honest?
But the arrogance of the archon's media whore elite doesn't stop there. A war game was judged ""inappropriate"" because ""some people lost their children in that war""... 
Wasn't the war ITSELF the actual cause of the grief? Seems people forgot to be self-righteous about the right things when sitting all made up in front of a TV camera. You'll never hear that anchor-bitch actually go into the questions of why these wars were fought and why the blood spilled, or the suffering inflicted on so many, and whether or not she should be ashamed of having willfully participated in that conflict by signing her name on it, which she did by taking this political system seriously as an expression of her own life and choices, which she no doubt does."
23603,"If you do the same thing as a murder/Torture/Fps game, sorry but you are so fucking stupid. Then you say the game made you do it? If this keeps going i'm gonna mass murder people and blame it on School"

23610,"Are you kidding me? People are taking games to seriously. Games are for fun and are an escape from reality. Games are made so you can enjoy them. Its just a game people! It's not like once I okay GTA I'm going to go out and steal cars, shoot people, or go on a rampage. That's why games let you do those things because you can't do it in real life."
23611,"I have never understood why they always point to the video games first. I have always played games like this and have never thought about going to shoot up a school or anything like that. You always have to look in to their lives and see what they are going through. on the other comments saying kids use their minds less, that is a lie. I always played games as a kid and still made straight A's. Now i'm a nursing assistant and pharmacy technician. I still play games like this all the time still, and i am still doing good with mt college now. The studies usually have a lot of bias in them anyways thanks to good ol politics."
23612,84 AD News Coliseums are consider controversial for the mass of deaths of many Gladiators. NoRomanEver
23613,i wish people werent such cunts about video games...
23614,You see movies they can get away with many things but when its a game its prone to all sorts of controversy SERIOUSLY POKEMON? POKEMON? A game most of my brothers grew up with none of them saw it in any way satanic. and the battle of fallujah should have been released but no because of all the liberals who showed hatred for it and yes I know people lost there kids or spouses in that battle but that was 10 years ago I think its time to move on. (I know it may sound like im not being conciderate but I know how it feels to lose someone you care about)
23615,I love how this video ignores that its actually liberal politicians trying to outlaw violent content in video games. They show shortened clips from Fox News to make it seem as if that's Fox's stance when really they're playing devil's advocate with the guests on the show. Sure there is some conservative push back on some games but almost all laws against games come from Democrats while people on the right like Libertarians support their freedom of speech that the USSC granted them. Next time try not to make sure your bias is showing. Why not blame Bush?

23621,Artorias the abysswalker from dark souls ?
23622,i really dont get america... why would you blame a game for ppl killing ppl..... i dont know maybe the reason for that shit is that america is filled with uneducated morons controlled by stupidity and everyone of em gets a gun if he wants to... i mean thats some sirius shit going on there.
23623,Funny.. Conservatives attack gamers almost directly.. When gamers are the best hope to revive that messed up party. Why would you directly insult the young generation if you're trying to preserve the longevity of your party. I know several people who refuse to give the party the time of day because of their take on gaming.
23624,5:00 your son wasn't playing a fucking video game u dumb ass he was fighting for our freedoms 1 of wich would be to play fun & fucked up games... godamn!!!!!!

23630,Yhea i like killing masses of people in games because well i think its fun and i like chaos. But i also know that doing this inreal life is just stupid. Not only are you hurting lots of people its also really hard to do.
23631,"People will always try and blame video games for things that happen in real life because something always need to be at fault. In reality they should be blaming Parents for not raising children correctly, and not paying attention to their children often enough, Violent tendencies will show in kids because kids are known to do what they want when they want, If a kid shows physiological problems early take them to a doctor. Some People are born unstable, this is why parents should sit down with their kids more often."
23632,"its not always the game that is the problem, we have certain parents that buy m-rated games for their children. I wish ppl could see that."
23633,"with out violent video games the world would be worse off just think one guy comes home after a long days work of taking shit from a boss he does not like for no money, and he just wants to let off some steam so ingoes the bf4 or cod or gta, and hefeels better in a couple of hours. now take these away and he goes to a pawn shop buys a firearm goes in to work the next day shoots his boss, anybody he don't like and then him self, so I guess it was the video games fault that the government gives millions to company's for work but the workers don't see any of it right"
23634,No Russian is the best mission
23635,Not sure why you included Manhunt 2 instead of the first Manhunt! The first Manhunt wasn't censored and was pulled from the shelves whereas Manhunt 2 was just released censored and didn't cause anywhere near the controversy of the first.
23636,"Madam, I'm terribly sorry for your grief.
That being said, your son did have a choice, and he made it."
23637,"I'm not usually for game censorship, but I do agree that Manhunt 2 should have been banned. It was just OVER THE TOP gore. Manhunt 1 was fine, but in 2, he just gets out of hand with how he kills some of these guys. A lot of it is just needlessly aggressive."

Movies based on this shit are honored and respected, but when video games want to do THE EXACT SAME THING, ""it figures you would lose your funding because people's children lost their lives.""?! Just blows my mind of all the different things. What about all that news coverage on 9/11, making money on the backs of thousands of innocent lives. ""But we're just telling the story.""

It means that any little Johnny fuck up can grab there daddy's 50 calibre and go bat shit to his hearts content. It is complete fucking insanity! America you are doomed!

23657,I think JFK Reloaded should have got an honorable mention.
23658,where is postal 2?
23659,"If someone made a game about Satanism, people would freak shit and the press would be saying that it's horrible or bad, but if someone made a game about Christianity, the press would consider it's good. It pisses me off how if you're an Atheist or Satanist, you are instantly considered a bad person to the press.
I hope people understand what I'm saying. Btw I'm an Atheist, not a Satanist lel."
23660,"Fox news the leader of bullshit. Kids are allow to shot guns and own one but they blame video games. 5:00 that lady talks like only her son got killed. I had to laugh so fucking hard to the pokemon crap 1:35 the best ever BS .. American full of clowns in suits. This only show that Americans kids should stop playing games. Look at Japan Hentai, hardcore anime with blood and shit and the kids are not fuck up like the US only show they are fucking weak ass. Cowboys and Indians is allow. America history killing of the Indians"
23661,i always thought the black Jinx face was a shadow and not its skin.
23662,"How the fuck is Pokemon satanic? God damn news reporters have been stupid ever since TV was invented. They are part of why I hate saying to anyone I live in America I'd rather live in the UK, but you know what I love my family so I will just stay where I am."
23663,Whats the name of the epic song they use (if anybody knows)
23664,I'm glad the DBZ games are off the hook
23665,The thing is about the Modern Warfare Two controversy is that they don't make you shoot the civilians. That is a choice a player can make if you don't want to be a terrorist. The only people you have to shoot are the guards and they shoot at you first so it's just considered self defense
23666,Now man hunt I think is right to be mad at
23667,Fuck al the game controveries
23668,okay so millions upon millionsof people play game like call of duty but when one psychopathic kid goes on a rampage the video game he was playing is to blame? surely if that was true more kids would be doing shit like this
23669,I wonder what video games the Romans were playing when they massacared carthage
23670,"Violent video games do not make people kill. Crazy people having been killing innocents for years. They were doing it before video games, their going to do it when there are video games and they will still do it if the game are band. Crazy people are still crazy."
23671,why its a lll just games they shouldn't ban any game thats why its called a game something to have fun with not to take seriously but for the ppl who do well that is their parents/their fault mann fuck not blaming anything on you guys just saying though mann
23672,In my life playing violent video games makes me less violent
23673,"The problem is, your source is Fox News! Just wait until all of the racist, primitive octogenerians die, Fox News will also die."
23674,"the fact is, if youwent on a mass shooting in real life, then youwere probably fucked up in the head to begin with, videogames or not. I have played a ton of first person shooter games, and the only thing they have ""influenced"" me to do is support our military more, just knowing a small shred of what real life soldiers must go through without the option to simply ""respawn."""
23675,"Reporters: a massacre! Lets blame video games for no frikin reason! :D
Me: what's your frikin proof!?!?!?!?!??"
23676,who's gonna stop us now?
23677,i remember tht part in black ops i cudnt bring myself to shoot lol
23678,The Bloody Banning in Aus and Fucking blaming for massicures
23679,Manhunt 2 is to this day one of my favorite games ever.
23680,Same
23681,I have seen saints row 4 in Australia I live here and I own it
23682,"8:39 thank you for speaking the truth , in some country video games are see as the work of Satan , they don't realise that it's the player's mental state and not the video game that cause people to do things like kill peoples. It is juste more easy to blame video games so that's the first thing they do. ( Sorry for my english , i'm french )"
23683,violent video games cause violent behavior mostly because it's stupid as fuck.
23684,"I got Resident Evil 4 not long after it came out. Why do I mention this? Because I wasn't old enough to buy it myself. My mom had to buy it for me. The Gamestop employee explained to my mom that it was violent and was inappropriate for my age. Mom just said ""She's not an idiot. She knows the difference between real life and a video game. It's not going to make her run around and shoot spanish zombie people."" Video games do not make people violent. Video games make unstable, insane people violent, which most gamers aren't."
23685,"You fail(ed) as a parent if your kid(s) emulate what's featured in video games, most notably the violent ones. It doesn't take much common sense to distinguish real life from a virtual world and to behave accordingly. Congress should have no involvement with video games. By the way, Pokmon = witchcraft? facepalm I've had heard enough religious people protest Harry Potter when the books/movies/games hit the shelves. Video games help us escape the harshness of reality, allow us to break rules and more. I utilize first-person-shooters to alleviate the stress built up from dealing with ungrateful people at my job who sometimes give me a share of their bad attitudes. I play racing games because let's face it, the speed limits in the USA suck ass and cops hump my car bumper (because it's red, they likey I guess). With all this in mind, after a gaming session, I return to reality... refraining from beating up hookers, sniping off policemen, racing through public streets @ 110mph, etc."
23686,fuck fox news
23687,"0:20 went back to see if it said fox news.... yep, it said fox news"
23688,None
23689,"I play games because i would like to live out the plot myself, closest thing to it. Im not a casual gamer at all so im all over the place. I dont like games like GTA because why would i want to hear or see that shit? Zombies monsters all that bullshit is fine, but just running around bIowing people's heads off for kicks is for the dumbest of motherfuckers to find enjoyable. But thats just my opinion, at least i dont think the people who enjoy it are mental cases or school shooters, but i know something is missing emotionally to want to express yourself that way. especially just for fun -.-"
23690,"about the mass effect sex sences. anyone reporting that it shows women as sex slaves, the women are all badass soiders and one even sacrifces (maybe) herself. the sex sences were not meant to be about sex about about sheaperds connections with the characters, and it added much to the franchise. btw sorry for my shit spelling"
23691,They all pissed me the fuck off but the last one more than anything
23692,None of the aforementioned
23693,7:52 Jack Thompson.
23694,The media always blames games and tv when it's often their fault for violence.... talk about irony.
23695,I wish Pokemon taught me how to cast spells.
23696,opens google and types: manhunt 2 pc download ... :)
23697,In the No Russian mission it is completely possible to get through the entire mission without firing a single shot or killing anyone.
23698,"I think it's time for US the people to control what the Senate and House do, I'm sick and tired of them trying to regulate games, Government don't need to play parents to us..If we wanna play them we will, They can't stop us..We can just get them on the black market or Ebay. Life would be alot better of Government would but out of movies,books,and games. Just let us do as we please as long as we're not hurting no one or revealing national secrets..I say we end all censorship except for national secrets that need kept secret, And we severely limit what grounds people can sue for just because they get offended over games, Afterall they are just games..DO NOT forget this."
23699,people have to much time on there hands to cry about a video game. . . where the fuck do you find the time.
23700,love how my Toronto reporters at the end finally said you can't just blame video games. just based on that i assume that they are among the smartest reporters out there. TORONTO REPRESENT!!!
23701,mental illness now that is an epic line xD
23702,people are so stupid
23703,What about Medal of Honor?  They delayed the game and forced name changes resulting in a good game being trashed by the media.
23704,Did the narrator say its conservative media that keeps bringing up video game violence leads to real life violence? Its the fucking liberals you stupid narrator
23705,no wonder most of this was by fox news... unresearched bias..
23706,"lol, blame the guns and games all they want, but they act like people cant just be messed up."
23707,"Out of all of the Games, my Current Fave is GTA5, Ive got Young children, and although they want to play it, I dont let them because of the shear amount of swearing in the game,
But what I love about it is the amount of mums that come to me in the playground at school and complain about what their kid did in GTA5 the day before is Funny, not only are they letting their child play and 18 when they are younger, the stuff thats they moan about is what GTA has had in it since at least GTA3, makes me laugh,"
23708,i seriously sometimes dont get why people blame videogames for violence. I've played Saw and I'm not gonna go out and adbuct and murder people
23709,"The ""No Russian mission"" is not any different then any other mission.
If you believe that it is worse to kill one demographic over another, then shame on you. Both civilians and soldiers have families, hopes, and fears. The act of killing is immoral period. If anything, it is worse to kill the soldiers because they fight and sacrifice so much for their country and others. That being said, violent video games do NOT lead to violence. There was so much killing in history that this doesn't even compare. The deaths of innocent people is horrible and the type of people that perform these atrocities will always exist as long as they are unhappy. Violence has actually gone down since the interdiction of video games.
Thank you, and Good Day"
23710,"There have been mass shootings and pointless killing thousands of years before video games were invented, I love shooter games and have been playing for many years and never shot or killed anyone, blaming games is an easy way to forget bad parenting may be a major cause"
23711,"Video Games Dont Cause Violence! Penn and Teller did a short on it with a man who played CoD, and he didnt want to shoot another bullet after his first shot. Just Sayin"
23712,"Someone should make a video game where you have to go through the news HQ of ""KIT"" news and blow everyone away, then blow up the building...I'm sure that would go over great!"
23713,"The ""No Russian mission"" might have been a different kind of ""violence"" which makes it a highly ""inconsiderate"". I mean, sure, you can get to commit mass murder in most games but you specifically have to do acts of terrorism? I think the creators of the game just passed over the limit."
23714,is it just me or did this episode make u want to smash ur head through a wall
23715,"Here's another fun topic the military propaganda engine and the dirty corrupt corporate America. I think that should be a great topic to cover. Fox news lies should be shut down. That's not going to happen because the bankers, secret societies, corporations and the military industrial complex control the country. They run the government, news organizations, authority figures and the politicians. I think it's funny how it is not illegal to falsify the news and Fox news lies takes advantage of this."
23716,parenting is to blame when u here this bs media hype about fucking mass killings in schools is it really that hard to see people wake the fuck up
23717,"lol its funny when the gov cries over petty issues like ""Games"" lol little kids crying over violence."
23718,"So WatchMojo, I like your videos and all but why don't you make videos with atleast 720p instead of just 480p, I think it's a bit annoying."
23719,"lol, video game makes fun of adoption... what. Also who watches fox news"
23720,It seems that all the non-gamers have problems with gaming.
23721,"Oh the ignorance... It would be nice to see some numbers on what kind of believes these kind of censoring pieces of shit have. Fundamentalist christians anyone? Trying to take away other peoples rights in every fucking discourse of life. Pokemon is satanic? People claiming such nonsense should be locked up with straitjacket on the spot, no questions asked."
23722,god dang it you news reporter fu**s It's Rated M For Mature Audiance Not Magic
23723,"jesus christ, the torture thing in gta 5 wasnt even that bad, it was fucking nothing to me at least. people are really overreacting about that shit, i think we got bigger problems in the world than to fuss about little shit like that"
23724,Bioshock infinite?
23725,"I was really hoping that Night Trap would make it on here. After watching Game Grumps play it, I didn't see how controversial it was. Still don't."
23726,"all of us is not like that,respect us"
23727,"Its a GAME. If you wanted to stop people getting affected by videogames and killing in real life, FIX YOURSELVES and help these people instead of banning games. Your PEOPLE are the problem, not the Games."
23728,I was raised on pokemon and mortal combat haha
23729,Why does WatchMojo only upload on 360p. Its 2014.
23730,"This is why stuff like this is happening. Rather than deal with the actual social problem of real world violence, the media looks for a scapegoat, someone or something to blame. The claim that video games encourage and cause violence could not be less accurate, and video games actually have a wide range of benefits for players too (both health and psychological benefits). I hate how people just assume that games are to blame because they have gore and guns in them, it simply isn't true."
23731,"Fox News should just STFU with all there stuff, if they had U.S. marine testimonies, telling the events of the war who said it would be good or bad. But they should also say that this is what the actual troops who served saw what they saw and gave there thoughts and emotions to what happened. Also if shooters turned me into a psychotic killer, then why doesn't Madden turn me into a superstar?"
23732,Its actually a fact that violent video games do not make people crazy and killers instead it keeps them in a room playing a game and not making them killers...... BUT HEY NEWS REPORTERS ANDEVERYONE ELSE INTHE SOCIAL BUISNESS NEED SOMEONE TO BULLY
23733,lolz im playing pokemon while watching this
23734,"The news reporter from number 4 seemed like a bitch.I think the people that create the controversy with video games are the sort of people that cant distinguish real life from pixels on a computer screen, any reasonably smart person would know that a video game on a TV screen is not real life."
23735,"MW2, most fun level I've ever played in the CoD series.."
23736,"I remember when american news said starcraft 2 was a source of violence lol.
Korea, which made starcraft series into pro gaming scene, had no gun death in school for last 5 decades."
23737,"can someone please tell me the music at 7:37?

23739,5:26 Dumb Bitch.
23740,and like the media and the govt doesn't cause alot of there own terrorists acts
23741,that the press love attention cause there a bunch of assholes
23742,freakin Australia needs to chill the heck out cause seriously whats the point of an 18 and up rating when you ban most of the games anyway! this makes their govt look alot like a bunch of prissy-ass crybabies oh wwahh! grow a set and let people play them ya stupid hippies
23743,"It really pisses me off when the news media does a story on violent video games. They try to link it with every bad situation happening in our country today, especially mass shootings. 99.9% of all gamers out there (myself included) play violent video games as a means of escape from the daily grind, a way to blow off some steam. It's only the mentally disturbed guys that then go and commit these atrocities in real life. ""But no"", the news people say, ""that doesn't make for good ratings, so let's blame everything on video games without a hint of proof or any scientific facts to back up our claim."" It's completely bias and propaganda in it's worst form."
23744,"When I try to think about stupid arguments,9 out of 10 times the all time classic video game-mass shootings connection comes to mind.Are people really that stupid?Not to mention that humans have been slaughtering each other by the truckload for ever,but studies show that since the advent of modern video gaming such incidents are becoming rarer and rarer.Not only that,but I feel offended every time a publicity-hungry 50 year old douchebag or bitch who claims to be an expert on the matter and is concerned about the safety of the newer generations starts talking crap on TV etc about how kids who kill in video games will suddenly become mass murdering maniacs.I could understand that video game violence is fiction and that there's no relation to the real world since I was like 5 years old.I'm either very special or they are idiots.I'm inclined to believe the latter."
23745,"wow...just wow the news put portal on the news for a dark joke, comedians do so much worse but again because its a video game they will point it and that's just sad."
23746,"All of the conservative news fuckfaces freak out every time some violent shooter stirs up some controversy, yet they're the ones who are fighting to keep the fucking guns. This country is fucked"
23747,Thumbs up for yogscast kim making it to watch mojo :o
23748,ending segment = mind blown.
23749,Only fool that can't discern between game and real world
23750,"i hate the fact video games are always blamed for crazy people. the game did make them crazy, they were already crazy."
23751,People are dumb as hell and none more so than news networks. Which is why I don't watch any news I just don't care anymore
23752,"people need to chill. its a video game. you know to have fun with. like Metroid,Mario, Sonic,Halo, etc. if two kids liked one video game where you can kill fake people, ""it's the video games fault."" No they simply just snapped."
23753,"Fox news + FPS games = controversy
That's typical, whenever fox news conservatives see a game that they don't like, it must be controversial."
23754,Okay the torture scene in GTA 5 did make me cringe a bit.
23755,"That Terminal mission in MW2 was baller as fuck, played that shit dozens of times"

23764,Which game is shown at 3:25?
23765,"when religious zealots and Fox news give an opinion, one should just discount it out of hand. Never trust opinions and commentary from liars, morons, and willfully ignorant douche bags. Just a suggestion"
23766,This really pisses me off DX
23767,I would like to know where witchcraft or spells is in Pokemon.
23768,I like how it's always America complaining about these games and blaming shootings on them. Maybe if they didn't legalise firearms people wouldn't shoot each other on the streets. :P
23769,"People always seem to end up blaming video games for real life crimes but THIS is why these little kids should stop playing 18+ games, maybe except the ones who can clearly handle it. >8("
23770,"Lol games don't kill people, fucked up people kill people."

23772,Mental illnes is in America so who cares :)
23773,"People are afraid of what they do not understand, and in short, blame that very same thing for those misunderstandings."
23774,I played Wii bowling religiously for awhile and I have yet to spontaneously bowl a perfect 300. Maybe Ill drown my sorrows and pick up Meth Sim 2000
23775,notice that its all american news channels :')
23776,manhunt should be banned
23777,Sonic the hedgehog should be banned as the evil guy- Dr.Robotnic is a ginger.. also when sonic dies thats cruely to animals...
23778,"If someone feels the urge to go out of their way to murder an individual after viewing it in any form of interactive entertainment, then the issue roots from dangerous psychological issues that were already present, not the gaming industry itself. It has been proven that the majority of gamers are perfectly aware of the implications of real-world murder."
23779,"Cooking mama doesn't make me a cook, sims doesn't make me a father, so why the fuck would call of duty make me a murderer"
23780,Gotta love how 90% of the negative press is Fox News.
23781,Good ol' Fox News lollll.
23782,"Ahh... Mortal Kombat, I love you."
23783,I fucking hate people who think that video games =violent crimes
23784,what about movies i think thats worse than video games
23785,Hate p
23786,Love how Faux News is leading the charge in 90% of this video
23787,"While I am extremely against the conclusion that video games lead to violence, I still believe that it is still wrong of parents to buy games such as GTA V and Call of Duty for children. Those kind of games are rated M for a reason, and back in my day, I the most violent video game I played was Duck Hunt!"
23788,I didn't read many comments but I live in aus and own both state of decay and sr4. They both sucked dick anyway.
23789,"5:23
Kind of a bitchy move. She has to make a snide remark and then cut him off before he can defend himself.
1:05
Wow. First of all, the sex scenes are short and there is much more to do with the character's personalities. Secondly, you can't commit polygamy. And lastly, YOU CAN PLAY AS A FEMALE.
It's pretty obvious that all of these people don't play video games, so why the hell are they reporting on them?"
23790,"we would have a lot less of these people complaining about these games if parents didn't buy mature games for their 11 year old kids.
and to the people that think some games are satanic (like pokemon), do everyone a favor and just shut up"
23791,"That ""No Russian"" mission is really fucked up."
23792,if i had a lot of money i would make the mostviolent game the world has ever seen just to piss-off those peaceactivists
23793,no one plays the campaign on cod anyway
23794,I see a whole lot of Fox News complaining...
23795,watch my videos! and comment! please!!!!!
23796,"People can be real pussies these days. ""Oh no! A game with a gun and a little bit of blood!  The horror!!! What's my 12 year old son gonna do when he sees that gun!?""  My god!  Shooting games have been around for years.  And NOW they're concerned?  People need to toughen up!  And Pokemon being an example of WITCHCRAFT!?  C'mon, REALLY!?"
23797,For the last thing in this video a short gues...: 4 out of 10 Killers played Counter Strike... 10 out of 10 ate bread... we should forbid bread!!
23798,"(About #10) Big whoop, you get the option of intercourse once. With the rest of the game, you have to rescue everyone from extinction.Apparently saving the galaxy is a bad thing, who knew?"
23799,"find me one man of these there at the video who isnt 70 years old
and didnt complain about the game
just try"
23800,Video games are just used as scapegoats as a way of covering other peoples fuck ups. Its just another form of media being blamed for everything wrong in the world its BS and i wish they would can this petty bullshit already.
23801,"typical though, some psychotic kid plays a video game then flips out at mcdonalds when they get his order wrong, i'm surprised our media hasn't targeted ""Sesame Street"" yet for teaching our children to do drugs and rob stores.
The last statement in the video is by far the most level headed and sane statement i have ever heard on those incredibly biased news networks, ""had a history of mental illness""
talk to stuck up bitches and they will say along the lines ""because one mentally ill person played the game and did that, EVERYONE who plays the game will do it."""
23802,Oh America...
23803,Oh dat kid drop a cookie blame it on video games oh! Dat kid fell off a rock better blame video games
23804,Pokemon really lol religious cults are dumb
23805,"As someone who enjoys violent video games, particularly Call of Duty and the Grand Theft Auto series, I really did hate the 'No Russian' mission from Mw2."
23806,Fuck Fox News
23807,"Well i do like Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 but it pissed me off when i had to shoot serbian soldiers, because the game is full of propaganda! Serbs didnt spread geneocid in Bosnia, it was the croatian bastards!"
23808,"""Mass shooters were video game addicts.""  
Hmm...you know, I bet they all wore clothes while they did it too...I suggest a band on polyester blends....just to be sure. Cover all the bases..."
23809,"No Russian involves guns, this might lead to real life terrorism.  And GTA IV can be played like No Russian."
23810,People are fucking stupid. That's all I gotta say.
23811,"If video games made kids violent, you'd have millions of massacres a year.
And why is it okay to shoot up and blow up innocent people in other countries, but not here?"
23812,The one thing that's funny is that people find violent games were entertainment in ancient times(Roman gladiators).
23813,Ya I think the people who kill don't kill because of video games
23814,So what I enjoy COD and the BF Franchise just like any other teen because it's actions and gives you a chance to be a solider. Does that mean I'm gona grow up and become an Insane gunman or the crazed butt stabber? Didn't think so.

23819,I hate that video-games get the heaviest fucking hits like why!?
23820,lol just because it banned in Australia doesn't mean l don't have them THERES EBAY BAN THAT
23821,cough*cough (fox news sucks) cough*cough
23822,Why do people blame video games I mean its not the games or the creators fault. if parents and politicians think a game is too violent then they shouldn't buy it and also parents buy the kids games not the kids at GameStop they even ask the parents are you sure you want this game for your child. I have been playing video games since I was 7 and watching my brother play since I was 4 and we haven't massacred people in a violent rage.
23823,"are you serious? ""usually fueled by conservative media"" honestly people, why the fuck do you need to bring in political biases into videos like this? The weeks after Aurora's shooting, i remember seeing 4 segments on MSNBC about the correlation between shootings and video games. MSNBC is as blatantly liberal (if not more so) than fox is conservative. take your political biases out of non political videos."
23824,i dont get it not the fucking game that does this it is the player thinking of doing stupid things. Games are just for the entertainment.
23825,"Hey! How about the Resident Evil 5 or 6t trailer, in which you killed black zombies, and it was considered ""racist""."
23826,s/o mojo
23827,"what the fuck is this world coming too, has no one got the freedom anymore to play a fucking game without some cunt going around claiming that games cause people to go on rampages. its bullshit who doesn't like blowing a bit of steam on a violent video game, in fact i think violent games relieves anger preventing violent situations. the more violent the better!!!!"

23833,"They did this nonsense with dungeons and dragons too. They tried to tie D&D to some murder cases where there was no connection but the media took the story and spinned it. Why? Because being told that a game could make your children violent gets people listening. I hate the fact that some of this people are ""conservatives"" because real conservatives believe in free will and understand that people make their own choices."

sux even whose here in Australia its such a shitty country with so many games getting cleaned up or banned, just because of people who dont even fucking play them find them offensive. IF U FIND IT OFFENSIVE DONT FUCKING LOOK AND DONT LET UR KIDS BUY EM, why the hell should everyone suffer.

23840,this is the reason people hate people. this just proves we have no freedom of speech. all the games except custer's revenge are not horrible satanic terrorist cell games. people just find a reason to hate it then get famous off of it. it pisses me off that people overreact to stupid little things
23841,"Fuck the press and fuck you who say we cant put this and that intoa game. It's fake period, and this is why we play video games. These games aren't real period. It is a cop out when things in reality happen and have been seen in a game etc. We have come to an age when we have seen it, done it, and have nothing more to really pronounce themselves into a original anything. Don't hate people, like we have all said it before. You don't like it!? Then change the fucking channel and keep to you're fucking self's. You little bitch!!!!!!!!!!! You want less violence tan look at the statistics in Texas. Everyone carries a fucking gun and that's why there is 3% in crime. You fucking idiot's shave no idea what freedom and violence have to do with anything.To solve the situation in you're so called theory in games.

23849,I think games help you vent your emotions or anger its better to punch the tv screen than to actual punch a person (speaking from experiance) but i turned out alright not killed anyone.....yet
23850,damn watchmojo makes you just KEEP WATCHINGGG
23851,"I want to beat the shit out of every news reporter, preacher, and anti war activist in this video. especially that preacher, what a dumbass"
23852,violent shootings arent alwayse videogames. mabey it was bad parenting or abuse or just emotional trouble by going into puberty. people still murdured people when there werent even tvs for these reasons
23853,Who would think a country that let's people purchase guns with very little background information would have shootings?!!! gasp it HAS to be the fault of video games!!! (continues to drone on untrue things about people who play video games and why buying guns doesn't cause any harm in any situation ever)
23854,"i dont agree with the controversy surrounding MW2, it gave the player a reason to hate Makarov, and want to see his demise"
23855,lol i like 1
23856,so just because i played MW2 i have to go shoot up a school? (media you suck)
23857,Rapelay is a rather controversial game in my opinion.
23858,Jack's still relevant? hmm figured him getting barred from being a lawyer for wasting the time money and brainpower of everyone would make him no longer matter.

23867,games don't cause violence. please tell me what video game people were playing a 100 years ago were people still killed each other with guns and other massacres occurred
23868,I'm surprised Bully didn't get a mention. Seemed like there was a decent amount of controversy over that one.
23869,"A lot more people died in the world wars and all of the other wars that feature in gaming, but for some reason Fallujah or whatever is going too far?"

23879,"How could you possibly hate a game that educates people on the atrocity of war. It was backed by people who had really fought in the battle, was extremely realistic, and brought to light a battle in which not many people had even heard of despite it's significance."
23880,Your life must be dull as hell if you nothing better to do than demonize Pokemon.

23884,"here is what i dont get. somebody liked something that has violent content then they decide, for completely different reasons, to kill people and automatically everyone points to the videogames as the ""cause"". if there was a cult that would kill everybody who didnt like twinkies but also happened to play cod, arma, battlefield, or gta, then it is the VIDEO GAMES that caused them to kill others, not their beliefs. people need to listen to the scientists more often when they say that video games DO NOT affect behavior negatively."
23885,"Can someone explain to me, what is Australia's problem? I don't get it, why they are banning videogames. i understand that Manhunt deserves it but what about Saints Row? that game is i think just a joke (to me) and it shouldn't be taken serious."
23886,Oooooh fuuuuck yoooou.mortal combat was the shit.i played number 2  when i was about 6 and you dont see me rippin faces and pullin spines.
23887,Video games do in fact desensitize one to real violence and the outcome of it. This is why the American Military uses them to train Soldiers and Recruits.
23888,Jesus Christ we are living in a world like south park....fucking idiot adults everywhere.
23889,"Actually did a high school report on that last topic. It really bothered me how easily people blamed violence on video games in many situations where such allegations hold no water. Also, how was the game made completely about the Columbine shootings not on this list or the honorable mentions?"
23890,The Mass Effect thing was so fucking stupid. Here's people who have probably never touched a video game pretending they know everything there is to know about it.
23891,"If Call of Duty teaches me how to shoot people, Guitar Hero teaches me how to play guitar."
23892,"Amazing how the leading news ""source"" pushing these ""non-troversies"" is fox...."
23893,"Another thing... I somewhat agree with the modern warfare 2 controversy, but at least I know why the plot requires it! The CIA didn't know that they were sending Allen undercover just after Makarov planned to attack the airport. And besides, this game series paints a pretty good picture of the world... ugly as hell. There is no pot of gold at the end of THIS rainbow, just death, death, and more death."
23894,"Fuck you, you FUCKING BUREAUCRATS!!! Games are made to be FUN! I am addicted as hell to Saints Row, but do you see me going out and gang banging, stealing cars, or running prostitution rings? Didn't think so! So just shut the fuck up, and let us have fun in peace."

23913,They don't understand us gamers.
23914,"what about the movies based on war? what about erotica books? video games is just another form of entertainment which contains sex and killing. 50 Shades of Grey, Game of Thrones, Black Hawk Down ect. when it's a book or movie its okay huh? just saying..."

23919,"Censorship is a valuable tool for governments, news media, and politicians; it allows the creation of order within chaos, prevents the undermining of government authority, and flourishes the growth of accepted ideas. Yet at the same time censorship limits the ability of those affected to see the world as it is, and come to ---- their own conclusion--. Censorship inhibits the rights and liberties of people to share information, games, or whatever medium. Looking at the past and later the present, one may only speculate what consequences the restriction on information will have."
23920,"So I guess that the media is saying that people don't hurt people, guns don't hurt people either, video games hurt people... I say bullshit."
23921,ill tell ya i was an a violent asshole before i played video games and i will be after i stop playing them

23923,Fox News are idiots.
23924,Fox News sucks ass.
23925,"News channels like Fox love, like really love it when mass shootings happen since they get the most material to cover about it. they also don't lose since:
1. they get to blame videogames for violence which garners them more viewers since it's ""controversial""
2. people who are stupid enough to watch them have their support
but when in fact, they dont really care about anyone in both sides of the argument. they dont care if a thousand people die as long as they keep getting money"
23926,So glad i dont live in Australia. Gamers have it so bad there.
23927,Pussies :)
23928,"The Mass Effect claim is bullshit. It's a game where you can play as a woman if you decide, so it's not like it a game focusing on fucking whichever woman you want."
23929,Yeah Kim is in this one
23930,If there's something controversial about a video game you bet your ass the news will have something to do with it. cough Fox news
23931,"I think #4is a shame. The whole point of a lot of gaming (personally, but I also think this applies to most cases) is to experience a story, and to experience an almost completely true (obviously it wouldn't be completely accurate, since it's a game regardless) account of such a battle as Fallujah would be incredible in a lot of ways.
I also think it's incredibly hypocritical for that to be cancelled but not a lot of other similar games. 'Some people lost their children in that battle.' (More than just people's children died, people lost spouses, siblings, parents...)
Alright, fair enough, people died in this battle and that's upsetting, understandable.
But...I mean, let's look at the CoD series ALONE:
1, 2, 3, World at War: WW2
Black Ops: Cold War and Vietnam War
That is FOUR GAMES set in World War 2, which I don't think I need to point out is on a much larger scale than the Battle of Fallujah. One battle does not compare to a world war. And guess what happened in WW2? A lot of people, not just some people, a LOT of people lost their family members. So why didn't all these WW2 based games get cancelled? And that's just the CoD series.
It had the potential to be a heartbreaking and incredible game."
23932,yay l4d
23933,Why are religious people so fucking retarded?
23934,"damn, i must be a violent-cool-blood-wizard"

If we are really afraid about gun violence we should remove the easily accessible firearms.
And as for killings in general we have always had mass killings just look in your textbooks or go to the library.
We have always had serial killers, cannibals and psychopaths running around long before televisions and video games."

24016,"Stupid politicians. Always throwing video games under the bus because they are tired of saying that the causers of shootings and other crimes involving violence and or weapons, have mental issues. Most people play some form of video game or another. A large portion of that is kids and teenagers. Ranging from COD to Minecraft. And it's always COD's fault because they have shooting and it's in first person. More recently GTA, because it's a free roam where you can do basically anything. When one takes into account all of the facts that politicians and other anti-video game people do, it's not hard to see why so many studies have been conducted to see if video games are the root of shootings, violence, extreme crimes, etc., have all come up saying that it's not the fault of video games, but rather it's mental illness. So get off of the backs of video games, their gamers and their producers, and leave us the FUCK ALONE!"
24017,"Games are suppost to be fun and entertaming, not to be taken seriosly. And for it's parents job to look upon game what kid wants, M rated games are for reason for Mature, not for the 13-15 kids. Problem of this days is the parents who can't say no to kid and stupid laws that forbid to pull a child hair or somthing similar, back in my days it was a clear message to ""Don't ever do that again""."
24018,"For the game about the war, it really annoys me that it got banned because wouldn't you rather want a war game that was more realistic than Cod and Battlefield.To give people an actual taste of what war is like. Also real wars are somewhat dipicted in every FPS. So don't bitch and moan just because your son was in that war and ""doesn't get a second chance"" It also annoys me that they didn't even give it a chance."
24019,This goes to show how the world is filled with stupidity people that care about video game problems when there is a lot of real life problem going about.
24020,"Okay, i like fps's and mmorpg's asuch, but i've never considered picking up a gun and shooting people. We shouldn't be put in the same catagory as the ones who do."
24021,"If humans were so simple that one or many video games make you a killer, then theorethicaly we would be at the same as a less developed species. If psycology and general knowledge about people can tell one general truth, then it's that we are complex creatures where EVERYTHING plays as mush of a role as NOTHING."

24032,Fuck fox news. They suck cock.
24033,"Clearly you people haven't done your research. Jynx or Jinx a word meaning bad luck, was based on the Japanese tale of Yamauba. Yamauba has a black face and blonde hair w/large lips. If you do the extra research you'll find out that America is the least intelligent nation in the world."
24034,I fuck with you .
24035,"Rock Music, Comics, The ""Adults"" blame the thing that didn't exist when they where a kid. The dumb asses who gives their 4 year old GTA 5, CoD, and Saints Row should not be included to the statistic of gun violence and video games...."

24043,"Video games are not the cause for violence! There's violence in almost everything! Why not blame that too?! No, violence is caused by people. It's like saying someone died because they were shot, and the gun was at fault. Don't blame the gun, blame the person who used the gun."
24044,There honestly stupid if they think games make people shoot up schools when they are clearly mental in the head you might never know it may have even helped calm them down until they ticked I agree that some games are really gory and that they don't Inforce it so you can get by as playing the game while your 10 or something

24053,"People blame video games just so they don't have to do any real work. Video games are fun because you can kill without doing any real damage. As far as the mentally ill playing them, why don't we give a seizure victim the flashiest video games, why don't we, then after this irresponsible fuck ends up in the hospital, we'll start banning movies too. Although that terrorist thing was horrifying."

24055,"I really, REALLY hate that FOX News cunt who wanted to make it look like the developer of that Fallujah game is a politically unaware sadist when in fact it's the conservative press who sponsored that fucked up war effort in the first place.

24060,"one thing i always thought was funny was they said you killed hookers in GTA, now i don't remember that mission."
24061,I love this video. But the politicians and news things made me so pissed off. Took me a lot to make it to the end without ranting haha.
24062,"Ahh Pokemon,
Back when I was a born again Chrisitan I went on a youth trip with some friends from church. We stopped at a store along the way that had Pokemon products out on display.
My friend says, ""You know pokemon means demon in Japanese.""
I reply, ""No, actually I`m studying Japanese and I can assure you that Pokemon is just an abbreviation of the English words Pocket Monster""
My friend walked away silently and I figured I had convinced her.
Moments later I hear her talking with someone else in another aisle,
""You know Pokemon means demon in Japanese""

24063,"To be a politician is to be able to exaggerate and project profound lies to extremities in order to persuade. In the eyes of a politician, manipulation is power. Nothing but a mere suit and tie, hah."
24064,I wish developers could make any kind of game they want without any of the censoring bullshit. Put a rating on the game and let people decide for themselves
24065,it is not video games doing this it people that are messed up in the head
24066,I feel like stupid people like parents against games along with PETA and politicians need to lose their right of freedom of speech.
24067,Fox news is really pathetic
24068,"Conservatives piss me off, if they want to take all our shit away what the fuck would we have left??? Like what do fucking conservatives do for entertainment? ""You can't have this or that and we don't care about rules that have already been made"" fuck you conservatives"

24074,"People need to shut the fuck up about video games. I swear, politions, PETA and journalists will find any excuse to try [And fail] to shit on a good video game.

24075,"idiots talkin their crap about doom. Guess what, you kill zombies and crap. Not living people. You guys ever seen the movie?"
24076,"The thing is that no one is interested in the root of the problem, its easier just to prohibit. People have psychological disorders and by the pressure of society disapproval (been characterized as crazy) they lost the opportunity to get better, and in this case scenario they are more likely to get influenced by anything related with violence (people screaming in the street ... and so on), videogames happen to be in the wrong place for a more likely situation in this globalized world where products such as this are dream gifts."

24081,How racist Resident Evil 5 was should be on this list.
24082,Newscaster makes the most sardonic comments at 5:18. Asking the game producer a question and then cutting him off to finish it herself. Completely unnecessary and disrespectful .. She should readjust her attitude and give respect regardless of what kind of what kind of game is being produced.
24083,News companies just talk about video games as if they're a disease so they can get views. That's all they care about- and their broadcasts are convincing people that video games are the worst thing that has happened to this generation.
24084,Violent video games do cause violent behaviors. Anyone who denies that is uneducated.
24085,"Did anyone else bust out laughing when he started shooting in the Modern Warfare 2 ""No Russian"" mission?"
24086,"German politicians have claimed that games like CS teach you how to shoot a gun. Yep, a pixel gun that has absolutely no weight and recoil teaches you how to shoot a real gun with weight and recoil. What the monkey fuck?
For GTA German media claimed that you score points by raping women and they were quick to draw a connection between shooter players and Neo Nazis.
This happens when you allow career politicians and journalists who abide political agenda rather than doing actual journalism.
Sidenote: it took the German censorship office 20 years (!!!) to take the original DOOM off the index.
Also, why don't these retards whine about the Civilization series? By their logic they should realize it's a ""genocide simulator""."
24087,its funny to think that in the end those people who are calling us immature for playing video games are the ones being childish about this
24088,The preacher on Pokemon made me laugh so hard I had to pause the video.
24089,Fox News just loves to blame video games so they don't have their killing machines regulated/taken away.
24090,"It is really sad to see that parents and adults place child/teenage violence onto video games or movies. Hell...
I have been playing games since I was 6 years old. I watched my brother playing stuff like Parasite Eve, Resident Evil, Phantasy Star. I played fighting games for more than 20 years now. I also played stuff like Silent Hill, GTA, Dead Island, Doom, Aliens, Call of Duty and hey, my little sisters do so too!
None of us has become addicted to violence yet. We are jokey, friendly, helpful and strong political and religious critics. We love philosophy, animals (have a big dog, three cats and two bunnies) and none of us ever hurt a soul!
We are a gamer family. Everyone in the family likes playing video games and we still manage to stay NORMAL!
Ever thought about the fact that these people you accuse of violent behavior due to video games, have you ever looked back on their lives? Have you ever wondered how they are in school? What problems they might have there? What company they've got or which people influence them? Ever thought that it is the parents fault for having no time for their kids, so they have to stuck them behind a machine?? Ever thought about that they might had psychological problems?? Or that they have enough of our corrupt society?
No. The first thing pinning the eye is a console and shelfs stuffed with games, so the games are at fault here. Not the human. Not the parents. Not the society.
Congrats, people. You've earned the ""Turn your eyes blind"" Achievement.
Be proud sarcasm >_>"
24091,"Always, this same. Stupid american kid (for example 14 yr old) shooting in the school after playing Quake or Counter Strike. This is parents fault, not game developers. No more legal gun, no more kills, that is so fu***ng simple. All Americans, still eat tones of hamburgers and preparing for Zombie Apocalypse. Thats the true. Sry, my english lvl isn't well."
24092,"You said news network, not Fox ""News""."
24093,all of these pissed me the fuck off
24094,"the media can go screw themselves! they blame video games for mass shooting, maybe the shooter was a video game addict but the problem is his physiological state of mind. I have played violent games for 6 years, did i go and bully and hurt people? Hell NO! Thats why i never trust the media in anything, all they say is bullshit!"
24095,"the entire media is fucking ignorant, they just wan't something to blame for the people that shot up a school when the true issue was bullying that lead to multiple cases of suicide and school shootings, and another reason why blaming video games is bullshit because if a player gets mad they won't go and shoot up a fucking theatre, because i have gotten mad over CoD and i was pissed but i was fine 5 minutes later."
24096,"I really hate how ""Blind"" parents are to video games like GTA. I'm 14, and I have played through the game and I'm playing with my friends online, and suddenly my parents have taken the game away from me. Why? Because they claim that the only purpose of the game is to kill and wreak havoc. I insist to them that it's not, and now they are planning to play themselves to really see what it's about. I hope to see their opinions change."

Based on the media that's what is going to happen right? geez wonder when the news will stop blaming games for the public's inability to realize these people have social or mental issues that just need to be addressed sooner rather then later =_=.
24099,I hate all the contervirsey cuz I play games hell I played masseffect I played gta but I also shoot clays and I can tell you somthing have a controller in your hand is completey deferent to have a shotgun 12g in the same hands
24100,Fucking Christians fanatics
24101,"Ok first off blaming video games is utterly ridiculous.... That being said... how in the hell is Pokemon evil, satanic and about witchcraft???? So all the shootings we have is because of video games.... people must have gravy for a mind if they think that is true. Now, if a game has a lot of gore, violence and such no you shouldnt let a child or someone unstable play it. But I think their comments that video games invokes people to do evil things is not true. I am a gamer, I have been playing video games since I was 4( 1989 on the original NES) Now playing that didnt want me to go stomp on mushrooms and beat up a turtle... Yes I have a PS3 and yes there are games that are not for children that I play but that does not mean I'm going to kill someone.. Its like blaming shootings and stuff on movies or tv shows... When will people say ""Hey this person is a bastard for killing this person or people did something wrong and will pay for it..."" Instead of ""Oh its because he played call of duty.... thats why he did it..."" really.... its a flimsy excuse instead of placing blame where it belongs... on the person. If you think about it a gun has no power unless someone picks it up, points it and pulls the trigger. Other than that its just a piece of metal it harms no one until its used. Also, there is already a warning/age label on games for ages that is for. E- is for everyone, T is teen, M is mature and A is for adult. So its pretty easy to guess what game you should get for a child or an adult... It sickens me that we waist time playing an object or thing for killing people when it is a person or people doing it... maybe when people wake up and realize that maybe something will be done, instead of using video games and such as a scapegoat... end of rant- Sorry just pisses me off we blame an object for what a person does..."

brainwashed cracked zombies get conditioned by the corporations to shootup the schools,So every time your gun laws get questioned and everything seems fine somehow a mentally handicapped person or persons some how mange to get into places with ammunition and ample weaponry at their disposal some how its always the cracked ones that get blamed yet uncovered details from real folders have found that the CIA does this to take your guns away! your government wants you dead to prove a point, and your a statistic either way"

24109,All crimes that are blamed on Video games Piss me off to no end. Ive played video games all kinds since i was a little kid and i am not a violent person by no means sure its fun to go on a rampage in GTA or Saints row from time to time But thats to relieve some stress so i dont feel like hurting anybody who actually breaths air. Everyone i know who plays videos games like i do are some of the most passionate and nicest people i know. I hate how News media feels its always a good choice to blame something that has been proven over and over to not effect people negatively. But i guess its easier to blame Games than it is to blame bad parenting or mental disorders.
24110,the news are the main source of evil and bullshit
24111,"When I was at a military px, Medal Honor had came out and we weren't allowed to sell that particular game on base because of the multiplayer function that had terrorist vs us force. It was then change to ""opposing force"" if I wasn't mistaken. Yet, it sold elsewhere. The controversy came with being the military force (being the Terrorist) killing U.S. soldiers. It's no different from games such as the Modern Warfare series (especially the second one) but everyone was arms up in the air about the game being sold on base. Majority of all the customers who bought these games were military to begin with, so I don't understand the ruckus."
24112,"This is why I can understand why there are idiots who would do their damnest to spoil everyone's fun on a game by attacking it. But hell, they won't do that with a movie. Oh no! I mean go look First Blood. That was a pretty violent movie and damn good one"
24113,I have an idea how about the U.S. Governments stop being democrat gun hating pussies who blame just about every single school shooting or such on video games!
24114,Boars in WoW.
24115,People just need to play games like gta and Cod for the fun of it
24116,I think it's pretty obvious that if you go out and murder a bunch of people in cold blood it's not because you just won a battle in COD or completed a mission inGTA your probably already really fucked up. But that's just me I guess cause these fucking idiots go screaming to the world otherwise even though its been disproven by many studies and cold hard FACTS not your redneck opinions!
24117,"I hated it when they were going against MINECRAFT. That's right, the kid's non-violent game MINECRAFT. Fucking MINECRAFT!"

We live in a society where we blame everyone but oursevles. Like the woman at the end said (who is clearly the only one with any sense) there are other factors behind shootings! Mental illness, socio-economic factors what ever the case may be there is always more than one factor fueling it!

24139,"In the german COD Modern Warfare 2, you lose the Mission ""no russian"" when you hurt a civilian."
24140,8:08 And the fact that mass murder is far older phenomenon than video games. I mean was Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre a result of video games? I also doubt that Withman something who shot people from the Texas clock tower played video games back then.
24141,"gosh, these people who blame every violent event on video games are so stupid. They are so stupid that they dont see that violent actions has been discreased since 1950 about 30% and something else...i have been playing a lot of violent video games like fallout, cod and amnesia since the age of 10 but every time i see a weapon or even a simple tool like the kithen knife i become really nervous...how could i kill someone because i play video games?"
24142,"Why would Doom be satanic? Demons are the bad guys that are killed by the player, that doesn't sound like something Satan would like."

Manhunt isn't allowed in germany too -.-
Germany = Australia"
24148,"Uh, I played call of duty since the first modern warfare and although it is apparently quite stunning I did not see a need for CoD2 to be in this controversy video because of a russian shooting. The big CoD controversy is over graphical violence in general from what I hear. Not an act of terrorism. Being a simulation of World War 3, I'd assume something like that would happen. In true military knowledge he was just doing his job. I played the mission and thought that he was being what he was, a CIA agent trying to get closer to his mission, I guess that would be assassinating Makarov. In not doing that, the game just went on a lot longer until makarov dies. I played it through to the end so I know this well. Sure, killing of innocent life is one thing, but what about terrorism? I don't get that. I would say the worst part about the entire situation was the mass killing. And as far as I know, it was makarov's plan/idea... not the players. And then of course you are later in that part of the game killed by Makarov for doing it, which sinks the whole idea that you got to enjoy the killing, leaving you tasteless and upset. I don't see where this is any act of terrorism but an act of evil on makarov's part."
24149,"This people are fucking retarded, why they so interested in forbidden videogames??? Its just games, nothing more. If they want their children more safe that forbidden the weapons in USA, not the videogames"
24150,"Shit, I had never heard of Six Days in Fallujah before this. I didn't except one of these controversies would actually be for a good reason. I did also expect them to talk about the accusations of Mass Effect promoting bestiality. I would say ""I guess those allegations were too dumb for any sane person to take seriously"", but given the nature of most of the controversies I really shouldn't put anything past the general public."
24151,just teach yo damm son self control and all those shooting wount have happen i play every day(im not a no life) without break i started when i was a kid and i dont feel like grabbing a gun and shooting people
24152,"No1 absolutely fucking shits me. Cunts that say that shit are basically saying that before video games people didn't kill each other. Bull fucking shit. Who the fuck are they to say what we can and cant do. Look at some of the movies that have come out!! The violence and sex in some of them!! Not that im complaining bout that.
Humans have been fucked in the head long before games. Its time to look at the individual and make them take responsibility for their own actions instead of allowing them to pass their actions off on something else. That includes drugs and alcohol."
24153,I can't believe people are still blaming video games for real world violence.
24154,People like to play games that let them do things they cant do in real life (excluding the Sims). Stop giving kids so little intellectual credit as to assume they would want to kill and rampage because video games made them lose their grip on reality and morality.
24155,"Anyone notice how it's always the Americans getting all worked up about the games? Like CHILL OUT! Those games don't make us violent, Lag does!

24156,fox news can be asses
24157,"Ok here's how the blame game works, it's the NRA being blamed for loose gun laws and they divert the attention by pointing the finger at video games. Damnit NRA deal with this bullshit and stop blaming videogames when it's your own fucking fault"
24158,Fox news is the asshole of the planet
24159,with games banned in Australia its not thatwe don't like or want the games as a lot of a lot of the games that we want to either get banned or censored due to a ridiculous ratings system that really needs an overhaul
24160,Yeah i think its stupid how video games are blamed for shootings. I agree completely that some games should be rated for 18+. But thats down to their parents if they choose to be bad parents. The only thing that is on around my godchild is cartoons
24161,"I totally understand the days in fallujah thing, it is a very specific event so parents who try to forget might cringe at the idea of it being interactive entertainment. and as for the no russian mission, shocking as it was, it definitely made me hate makarov. its shocking in the right way"
24162,"The only thing games made me want to do is stay fit, Dante from DMC, Kratos from GOW, ect. Obviously I can't kill demons and gods but the thought of being someone that strong and badass just motivated me"
24163,i love how rockstar push peoples bottons to get gta in the news on purpose to promote it extra and show thay really just dont give a fuck...rockstar really cares about fans.. LMAO i love rockstar.
24164,I am from Australia I know we mite not get some games other states have at least we don't have deasies like other states
24165,"i hate when people blab on about something that they DO NOT KNOW SHIT ABOUT..... pokemon? Witchcraft and magic???? Bullshit. there is not one IOTA of mention of magic! (unless you count the hex maniacs) but they all revolve around a world of animals born with extreme natural defenses! and if they mention ""potions"" those are MEDICINES to heal and or aid the body in growth.
and it's... a... GAME"
24166,People need to grow the fuck up. Just because its a violent game it doesn't mean im going to go on a killing spree. I mean come on people. Goddam...
24167,I laughed at all of these.
24168,"It's a fucking game, these people should eat a cookie and shut up."
24169,Its not games its the retareds who make the decisions to do that typ of shit in real life.
24170,interactive pixel sex!
24171,"Games are made to entertain people not to tell people to do it. If a person do something like from GTA, that does not mean it's the game fault, it's that person who decide to do it."
24172,"Manhunt2 ""Quite literally murder for entertainment."" So COD, Battlefield etc... are? :P"
24173,wiy  woild  you  Bring  This up   you  idynt
24174,"I'll be honest, I've played so many games. Call of Duty, Fallout games, GTA 3-5 and all of the GTA games in between, and others as well. I don't think that they make me violent. In fact, I've never been in a fight, I've never taken drugs, murdered people, stole cars. None of those things. I know so many other people who play them as well and have never done anything like that."
24175,"I remember playing Manhunt on the PS2, it was brutal, so far i've not murdered anyone real life."
24176,the news people are retarded becuz video games aren't killing people its people that are mentally insane so by playing m rated video games they think they can get away with killing people
24177,Sand hook was nothing but a play
24178,You can still get manhunt 2 un censored on pirate bay!
24179,carmageddon damn i remember that !!!!!!!!
24180,The media makes me sick when it comes to this...
24181,01:32 that guy is a waste of oxygen
24182,"What a controversial subject. In my opinion, I don't think a video game can corrupt a normal person, average minds do know how to difference the virtual life from the real one preventing any impact of their thinking...However, if you have a person with unusual psychologycal trends plus a violent videogame, just a bad combination..."
24183,Mortal Kombat and Manhunt FTW
24184,they accused pokemon of being satanic....and in the game they used witch craft -.-
24185,People need to calm down
24186,"fuck those critics violence, abuse, offensive stuff existed since the dawn of mankind"
24187,How about dantes inferno... that was one of the best games ive ever played and yet it was based in hell. There were dead babies in it. Countless nudity and sexual refrences. Yet just because it was based off of literature it got no attention. That tells us how much BS is in the world and how if you dont like our media than just dont pay attention to it.
24188,fox news: GO AWAY
24189,The media will do pretty much anything for a news story. with out news they have nothing to report and they dnt get paid
24190,"i think its bogus, video games are an easy blame, i and many of my friends have played violent video games since we were young and not once has it crossed my mind to shoot up a school"
24191,Here in the uk modern warfare 3 was nearly banned because one mission looked similar to the 7/7 attacks in London. Some stupid ones are battlefield 3 gained controversy because you killed a rat in a mission and it was banned in iran because the game was set in iran. The same happened with spec ops the line because it was set in Dubai. I have heard pokemon was controversal because it was apparently anti sematic
24192,"Oh look, a group of feminists and politicians with a huge napoleon complex that have nothing better to do. its almost as if they are trying to be the dickweeds we all know them as."
24193,"Jynx, Popo and a lot coming out of Japan and S. Korea was racist as all hell. They really have no idea how to depict brown or black people without being horribly offensive. Japan in particular was really bad with the whole gankuro craze."
24194,"violence has been round for centuries, did games warp peoples minds back then? No, so the government need to wise the fuck up!"
24195,The woman at the end actually isn't stupid. Good.
24196,5:29 Give the guy the chance to justify himself!
24197,"Manhunt was good Manhunt 2 was a little lame, I beat it in a day one freaking day!!"
24198,"Its funny how Homefront gets a pass since that game is depressing, well the last 2 levels were pretty cool though."
24199,"seriously, the media is just blaming a new thing for the violence today. 15 years ago they were blaming tv for violence, now video games. what next? fuckin heavy metal for Christs sake?"
24200,you serious? state of decay was banned in austraila? that's one of my favorite arcade games! and yet it's so cheap to buy next gen consoles there!
24201,Seriously? pokemon? WHAT THE FUCK! I GREW UP WITH THAT GAME! THIS IS SOME BULL SHIT IN THE WORLD!
24202,"played mw2 ""no russian"", killed almost all of the unarmed people, but I didn't do it in a real airport later lol.
games are just games. If someone kills another person after playing gta, he certainly didn't commit the crime because of gta. mental issues maybe?
you, as a parent, are supposed to know your son, so you also should know if he's not able to play certain games.
why do they allow ww2 games and not modern war games? Because the publisher lost a son? I'm sure she would have allowed it if the dead son had been someone else's."
24203,"I think everyone misses the point of the act of shooting a person in a video game. Regardless of what type of person the victim is, they are STILL an unrealistic thing! Shooting a 'civilian' in a game is the exact same as shooting an enemy/opponent. Political agendas annoy the hell out of me."
24204,The people that like playing the blame game are the liberals. Conservatives sometimes do too but it is usually the liberals You can not tell me that I am wrong. Think about it.
24205,"Its crazy how parents and officials bash video games and say they are linked to real life violence. I mean, how stupid can they be? Games are meant for entertainment and money for our wonderful economy. If don't like the game, please consider not complaining to the government and telling video game companies how to conduct business."
24206,I hate Australia's classification system. We're missing out all of the good stuff.
24207,at this rate video games will be outlawed
24208,Isn't there an online game where you actually play as the Columbine shooter?
24209,Most of them piss me off but the main one is the first one.
24210,"Honestly, people blaming murder on video games just sickens me"
24211,I live in Australia and I've got both state of decay and the full version of saints row iv.
24212,Konami Fallujah military game that would be incredible
24213,I hate how people like shootings to games games relieve stress and actually REDUCE violent acts
24214,notice how it fox news
24215,And people say the Fallujah Game was shocking but in my opinion it would have educated the world what happened there. There might the few sad bastards but don't let them ruin it for the rest of the gaming communities
24216,"They always blame these mass murders on video games. WHAT THE FUCK DID STALIN, HITLER AND ALL THE OTHERS BEFORE VIDEO GAMES CAME OUT. WHERE DID THEY GET IT FROM?!"
24217,who can hate mortal kombat?! Best game ever
24218,"People are so ignorants, video games is a new from of art going through the same rips as comics once did. Sometimes killers play video games and sometimes victims do too. Saying video games causes violence is the same as saying books, comics, movies, or anything thought provoking causes violence. Maybe the news causes violence too since everytime it saying teens are doing a new stupid fad that fad spikes"
24219,Pokemon world is a world of the demonic ! LOL
24220,I still own the GTA: San Andreas hot coffee version for the Playstation and Game Stop refused to buy it from me when I went to trade in a bunch of games. Was a little shock to know I had that one.
24221,Custer's revenge lol oh man i'm laughing so hard. That's AWESOME. You dodge arrows to bang an Indian chick. I swear game designers are the most twisted people.
24222,Gee I played 2 much cod better go on a mass killling spree a
24223,America is so stupid. You guys have wars going on constantly and a kung fu video game and some nudity get you all excited. Bunch of Bible thumping SQUAREs. No wonder the English had enough and persecuted you out of their country.
24224,"I don't freaking understand American. When someone cause a mass shooting with a automatic rifle (and he was playing video game like everyone else), they will blae the game, but will never blame the fact that you can get a weapon almost everywhere and that's totally legal. If they would stop selling those freaking gun, maybe they will have least school shooting, or least mass murdering. (and to conclude this post, let make a little prayer for all the kid and adult who died because of the congress stupidity of not banning assault rifle on gun store. Oh, by the way, i'm Canadian)"
24225,"My favorite part of No Russian is that, not only do you not have to actually partake in the massacre, you can actually engage the terrorists and kill THEM instead. Then you fail the mission because you failed to gain Makarov's trust..fascinating considering that he's dead and you've just averted WWIII."
24226,"Silly social media,you never realize you are the ones who instigate controversies."
24227,"To be honest, the Call of Duty level was a seriously idiotic decision. Not ONLY was the level boring as fuck. But it served no purpose whatsoever. It wasn't entertaining, It wasn't story crucial. It wasn't shocking. It was just ""What the fuck is this, why the hell did they even put this in the game?"""
24228,if you don't like the games don't buy them for your kids. If the majority of parents do this then the games become less popular and will be weeded out by the market. The root cause is us.....not the fucking game.
24229,Playing video games can somehow trigger this but it is the lack of proper parenting why there are such cases
24230,What that lady said at the end was the truth about everything...
24231,the # 1 thing on the list you hit spot on. I've played multiple shooters not just fps's and i'm just fine
24232,whats up with FOX 11 always bitching about shit they do not support. They make it seem like the world is going to completely fall apart if they do not like one thing.
24233,It bothers me because of some idiots
24234,Wow must of been a slow news day for one of them idiots blaming portal 2 on making fun of adopting wow
24235,I'm pretty sure everyone of these reports pissed us all off
24236,"all of clips are from fox, and we all know fox is full of it"
24237,"God Damnit. I don't know about any other gamers, but I for one am mad as hell at people thinking that the reason for violence everywhere nowadays is video games. I am 14 years old and I have never thought a violent thought from video games. the first experience with a violent video game was when I was 9, and I played with a few of my friends on CoD4. I have never done anything violent in the past 5 years of my life. I can honestly say that this topic is one of my least favorite topics. I am just so sick of people blaming things like sandy hook, and other mass shootings like the navy yard shooting on video games. WW1 was about 70 years before the first video games came out, and then the second world war happened, which is one of the most infamous events throughout human history. During the great depression as well, the KKK hung innocent black and white people just because they were different. That was a time when not a single video game was even thought of. And most video games from the 80's didn't contain a single drop of blood. The infamous 'No Russian' level from CoD MW2 was A VIDEO GAME. it is FICTION. Modern Warfare 2 was supposed to take place during 2012 and 2013. Has it happened? NO IT HASN'T. JESUS CHRIST PEOPLE. WHY ARE YOU SO DUMB?"
24238,"In the MW2 one their was also a choice at the start up of the game warning people and giving them a choice to play it so that's not the game, or game makers fault."
24239,"I just think banning violent video games is bullshit :/ So every CoD player will plan a terroristic mass shooting after playing the ""no russian"" mission? Yeah if that's so every guy who watches ""Saw"" will build traps to kill people. . .=____= Liked the lady at the end which brought up the mental illness of the most shooters, finally someone who understands the problem . . ."
24240,the news just need to fuck off
24241,"bullshit, that war game looked awesome. if those people don't like itthen don't pay attention to it bitches"
24242,"Most of these are horse shit, all you need in games is the age certificate (and why it's given that certificate on the back). Any bad influences on people should be blamed on parenting"
24243,man i bought 2 copies of manhunt 2 before they pulled it outta stores.... that game is straight up the most intense and graphic game out there
24244,Why is Fox News still considered a news source?
24245,"Conservatives: No, there shouldn't be gun regulations, but yes, we should monitor every videogame individuals buy."
24246,I don't believe that using violent video games as a global scape goat is a good solution to our problems. I think that instead of blaming violent video games for everything that goes wrong in this country and the world for that matter the world governments should put their time and effort into actually trying to solve the problem. Oh my god people trying to solve problems instead of taking the easy way oh wow such a shocker
24247,Custard's revenge? what in the actual fuck is that? I wanna play it now.
24248,yes but you cant also blame the guns either
24249,"Australia does have R 18+ rating on video games but they just but on the cover MA 15+ but on the disk it has 18+ to stop the government from bitching. (P.S. Im Australian, and we dont all sound like friggin sheep e.g Baarn (barn) we sound like Americans but we put less emphasis on r's. that is the only difference. That escalated quickly."
24250,"no fucking russia, had to go back on pg fighting games and back to arkham city, then bioshock now back to mw2"
24251,virtual guns are the cause of the problem or maybe real guns are the problem?
24252,"In call of duty ""no russion"" mission, i sweri didn't kill one single people ... and i was crying ... really"
24253,woooww ya pokemon is deeefinatley anti-religious and totally about animal cruelty. dumbasses
24254,"I like the (I'm sorry) Black Woman said in the last of the Vid, yes VidGames support violence, but it also war/action movies, Television, actual war on going till right now, pornographic on magazine & movie & some game. Every aspect could be considered support twisted mind. So do American & the World ready to get rid of everything that shows Violence & Pornographic. Well, Im just smile while drinking my hot cocoa ..."
24255,it just de-sensitises people to murder and gore
24256,i live in australia and it really pissed me off when they tried to ban the new aliens game because it was too graphic and realistic i got to play it and it was no where near as graphic as they made it out to be
24257,"In ancient japan they boiled people alive for torture, that must have been because they played violent video games, OH WAIT NEVERMIND :3"
24258,Videos games are meant to be fun BUT if you compare a first person shooter to real life YOU NEED TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!!!! Video games are very unrealistic THAT'S WHY WE PLAY THEM TO GET AWAY FROM REALISM >:(
24259,"The last news report was the only one that provided both points of veiw (which is what news is SUPPOSED to do). These stupid parents don't regulate THEIR OWN CHILDREN and then they wonder WTF happened. Until you parents can show me that it truly wasn't your fault, that your child was brought up with morality and perfection, I will continue flaunting your own stupidity and hypocracy."
24260,anybody notice how many times fox news appears in this
24261,people r so silly when they blame entertainment for bad things that happen
24262,"The media seems to just be looking for somehing to blame, when radio started the media maid claims to oppose it. Same with television,  and video games are still fairly young so there will be blamings that may be unsupported by factual evidence and studies.  For the shootings, I have noticed that the person is usually mentally unstable."
24263,"the ""fps games causes shootings"" is total bullshit and the news likes that shit. No matter what people say the studies will always be the same"
24264,Who ever told news networks to blame mass shootings on the fact that the shooter just happened to be a fan of violent video games was obviously not thinking straight that day.
24265,"Yeah, I agree to that. Video games are not the very first communicative entertainment of violent the media released to mankind. They have forgotten the very first resource of everything they created and only look at what their very narrow eye-can-see space that projected before them. Book were written about horror stories, violent fightings, tortures, man-eating organism, etc. After that movies were made and as we can as far seen, that the most hit movies fall in the category of Action. A.k.a Violent. I still could not believe in my eyes those idiots that judge on video games are actually worthy of knowledge to even work in the government/white house/congress/etc."
24266,Holy Fuck the Government and Media are so ignorant when it comes to these games
24267,"It's funny how all these idiots that constantly piss their pants over violence in video games never say SHIT when movies or television shows do the same things only with more realism... Also the fact that it's ok for somebody on TV to be brutally murdered with an axe, but if there was a tiny 5 second sex scene with full nudity people would absolutely lose their minds..... Really? Is sex really more obscene than cutting somebodies head off with an axe? Wake the fuck up people..."
24268,"Don't blame everything on video games.
Blame on your shitty parenting."
24269,"Guns and games doesn't kill people, people kill people . And there are a LOT of people that play really gore games and are very normal, stop blaming videogames of the mental disorder of some group"
24270,Old people are fucking stupid.
24271,Manhunt 1 andThe murder of Stefan Pakeerah
24272,I think the one that made me the most mad is the one about the shootings the parents are to blame to if the game is because is your under 17 years old you can not buy it without permission from parent or garden I mean theres aage rading on it for a reason
24273,"Think about this; the game Cooking Mama does not make me a master chef, the game Mirror's Edge does not make me an expert in parkour, so why the fuck would a game like Battlefield make me a mass shooter or a relentless killer? It doesn't make sense."
24274,man fuck the news
24275,the only news story that I agree with is the No Russian mission. I've always skipped it because thats one of the things that I'm most afraid of. Getting shot and possibly killed with tons of other people by a terrorist.
24276,Video games also don't portray men as anything else but a Conan build killing machine
24277,"Yet again another blame on games. It's the country's fault for allowing mental idiots to buy guns in the first place. Like in sandy hook, the dudes mom got him a gun. WTF does that have to do with video games? The mom was a retard and got her mental and angry child a gun. Just because I spend some time shooting people in games like Tf2 or Bf4 doesn't mean i'll grab a gun and shoot someone. When the press wants answers for a shooting they blame it on games instead of the country allowing people to buy sniper rifles and AK's in the first place. Why would you let the public buy guns then blame it on games? When there weren't games people massacred each other a lot too. Yet again the country lets people have weapons easily"
24278,"I remember trying so hard to get 'night trap' for sega cd after the controversy.. then when I finally got my hands on it (you couldn't buy it any moreat that point)... what a disappointment. terrible game.. nothing shocking about it. just boring.
btw, this video could be used as proof of faux news being a over sensationalist network that tries to play on ignorant peoples emotions to cause outrage and anger."
24279,six days in fallujah would have been a good game if some concerned assholes hadn't stopped it plus on number 1 guns don't hurt people people who uses guns hurt people
24280,lol of course Fox News and conservatives would say some shit about games
24281,"I hate when people shit on a game because of stuff that happens IN REAL LIFE.
War, torture, murder, rape it all happens in real life for fuck's sake."
24282,"Guys, lets see if you notice something in common with most controversies, They are because of the stupdity of fox news..."
24283,"If video games cause violence, then what the hell kind of f*cked up games were they playing thousands of years ago?"
24284,all the shooters were gamers! yea and all the shooters were white too. COINCIDENCE!!!!!
24285,i didnt kill single russian civilian in mw2. not ever. now if it was a beverly hills mall or something i might have gone nuts...
24286,"WHY DOES FOX ""news"" HATE FUN?????"
24287,"if we are never allowed to see through the eyes of so called ""bad people"" how can we ever pretend to understand them? thats why games where you play as the ""bad guys"" are really a learning experience."
24288,pokemon is dog fighting. not satanism.
24289,"HA! fox news clip... how dare they call that bullshit ""news""..."
24290,Those people are stupid how is pokemon satanic
24291,"#1 is just an excuse coming from the mouths of baby boomers that can't think for themselves. This is a constant thing that our generation will become once we go ""over the hill"":""blame the new technology for all the ills of the world"". My grandparents blamed comic books when my dad did something at my age, and for my dad, he blames video games for the same reason when we do something. It's a cycle that will never be broken!
PS: Never quote any politically-biased sources, such as Fox News, when trying to prove a point...EVER! It just makes you look like a zombified political bitch !"
24292,I feel the only reason that people blame video games whenever violence happens is because the people are to scared to admit that they have a problem so they blame whatever they can just to not look like a psychopath which everyone thinks they are anyway.
24293,It's a game!!!!!?
24294,"On that call of duty level, you can actually not shoot anyone. The game does it all, weather you pull the trigger or not. That's what I did. And the level progressed as normal."
24295,How About Fox During The Time Of Six Days In Fallujah Take A Look At Battlefield 4.
24296,Why are there only 4 comments?
24297,I remember seeing man hunter on the news it got a lot of bad crap.
24298,Battle of Fallujah: Men died for freedom yet we are not free to play the game...oh the Irony. Feel free to drink as much booze as you want while watching 1000's of graphic war movies though.
24299,yeah these are 18+ for a reason...
24300,I'm most disappointed with the 6 days in fallujah controversy. this was a venture for games to rise beyond simple entertainment and as a medium help tell the story of a modern historically significant event. was working with men that had boots on the ground there and the studio themselves worked on simulators for the military. it was an amazing opportunity
24301,"The Six Days in Fallujah case was just pathetic. There are a bunch of games based on real life conflicts where people lost their lives, why did they have to pick so much on this one?
Shame it got jumped by the retard bandwagon at Fox News and a bunch of people who didn't even know what they were talking about..."
24302,So sad....
24303,"I hate how the press blames practically ALL violence on video games when they obviously don't. It's only SOME mentally ill people who actually bring actions they have seen in video games into real life (to be honest I don't even think that it influences mentally ill people, but what the hell). Any way around 2 in 200,000,000 or something to that effect, kill people because of video games. 'Nuff said.
...Oh yeah, f*ck you if you think the opposite of what I just said
JESUS THAT'S A LONG COMMENT!"
24304,"Murica, country of muh freedomz and muh gunz. And whiny bitches complaining about games 'cus of their boring past..."
24305,"If I had known that so many games in Australia are banned, I wouldn't be moving there next month =("
24306,"Violent video games shouldn't be banned, they should be promoted because they are a true reflection on what society is really made of. War games uses the stupidity of war to actually have fun with it. Your son died in a war, that's fucking tragic but why the heck was he there in the first place?! To protect the country? Please be kind enough to remind me when the country was in a real danger to be invaded or fully destroyed?
Games are here to entertain and we love them. Fuck all of you religious cunts, fuck all of you conservative bastards, you won't fuck with my mind."
24307,"Conservative media? Hillary Clinton, Tipper Gore, Chris Matthews? Little biased there mojo...? It's not ""conservative media"", it political groups and media as a whole..."
24308,"the no Russian mission, don't think of them as civilians, think of them as Jewish people."
24309,"At the end, though - ""...mental illness is a big problem"" and this is why you keep the mentally ill - that are incapable of distinguishing between reality and fantasy - away from violent video games meant for mature, mentally healthy audiences.
Yes, what a big shock. ""M"" rated games with clear warnings in the game, with warnings in the games marketing itself, warnings, basically, everywhere - including the gameplay - are to be kept from the hands of the demented, impressionable children and, naturally, conservatives - because they're idiots.
Also, Australia - the North Korea of video games."
24310,....but is now no longer available. That's because you don't know how to get it.
24311,I play gta and now i want to steal a car grab a gun kill people then maybe jump in a helicopter and fly lol
24312,"This is why video games have ratings, for example my mother went to by me CoD 4 for my 15th birthday. The guy at Gamestop upfront said ""Are you positive that you will allow him to play this?"" Following with reading the warnings. If someone has a mental illness to repeat something drastic, then they should not be allowed to have the game period!
That is my opinion on this topic.
(The press is always looking for something to blame so why not blame technology?, Oh wait they already have!)"
24313,"Well I think these people are just frickin dumb why would they want REALLY got into the gaming problem? Why wouldn't they solve the world problem ? because they don't look at themselves,correct themselves what they doing? They SH*T all day in same game why wouldn't they argue with some adult adversitements in kids channel I wish they would know that. It's okay when that game is going too far extreme but WHY pokemon? are they jealous just F*ck themself up. Game is a game not REAL LIFE so don't wish it to be,don't blame the maker tell the people that the game is for matures or whatever in it because we have to get crazy and fun sometimes because we were stressed like that.You only live once you know. And please no more Pokemon problem because it's created by YOUR OWN MIND do not cause anymore sh*t like that,satanic demons witchcraft? play the game first what you will feel? if you addicted that's what our feelings like! they don't know what is being a child that playing games.Game about made from real life ,is teaching us to know what happened from people who died in war. Sometimes games made us know what it was like being in a terrible war being such a jerk.Teaching us, so we know the consequences what they do in real life. Like internet, video games have good either bad things and parents too they should be responsible like don't letting their kids playing too much, or observe first what age is allowed to play the video game for you children before BUYING.Games some can be educationing many good behaviour but sometimes bad and misleading too.Man...I think these people could do better than us but then some of them were just dissapointing....they just want to get themselves in camera so people would notice....money all day along...that's what they like to eat until their belly is fully big like a whale. I'm not too crazy for games anymore but I'm just telling you. Money cannot be brought to afterlife you know...[sorry for the long post]"
24314,"this is a typical ""tobacco kills"" scenario"
24315,"And this is why I find people who believe everything they hear on the news are crazy as fuck. If anything, I just hate the news. It's the most popularized form of entertainment misguidance ever created. I'd say the news is more at fault for violence than video games are for god sakes."
24316,i think these people need to play games and loos the stress of them being bad thay are just games!!!

24318,I was playing supermario now I have to jump on mushrooms
24319,"For the argument aboit Six Days in Fullujha, I dont get it. Why should that game based on a real life operationwhere sons and fathers ofliving people were lost (tragic of course I respect all Heroes who serve for their country) be so controversial? It seems to me that these people don't care about their Grandparents and Parent whofought in the Conflicts and Wars of the 20th century. Also they seem to have a few games, what about Black Hawk Down a game and film based on the conflict in Sierra Leon where too many young American lads lost their lives on a mission gone horribly wrong. And then the two most recent Medal of Honour games which are supposedly based on real life special operations that have happened within the last decade. Im not saying these games havent had scrutiny, I just think that people should actually think about the games already out that use real historical events to make their story line before they judge just one. The big question is ifthere been a film made about this conflict would tge game have been allowed?"
24320,"A lot of these critics are just pissed off because they didn't have video games when they were kids, and had to entertain themselves with yo-yos and bat and ball.
Most adults are probably envious that kids have better toys than they did."
24321,"Let's all forget about the mind altering pills such as anti-depressants and ADHD medication that have been found in almost all children, and even adults, who have performed random acts of violence over the past decade. Not like their bottles say, 'Warning, may cause suicidal thoughts or tendencies' or anything. Totally not that. It must be video games using magic brainwashing sciences to tell kids to shoot up their schools. Not their parents pumping psychotropic medication in them. Lol."
24322,what was the top pick? duke nukem was great with stripper's and cops as pigs !!
24323,"Dear world, you would have to be an idiot to kill people because of video games. Sincerely, a person who has played several violent games, yet still knows the difference between right and wrong."
24324,I completely understand the one about Six Days in Fallujah.
24325,fuck fuck fuck
24326,I grow up with gta and the sims...weird huh?
24327,Anyone who thinks violent games make you more violent obviously never played them personally I think they're very relaxing when I'm in a bad mood I just play a violent game like The Darkness 2 or Shank and it calms me down pretty fast
24328,why is it that whenever i heard these fear mongering broadcasts i want to drive down to their studio and crack some skulls?
24329,HmmFox News seems to be in most of theseI wonder why.
24330,its proven that video games actually make you smarter or have no effect
24331,"If you can think that playing a game like assassins creed turns you into an assassin, then I could watch jurrasic park and be t-rex."
24332,"If you can think that playing a game like assassins creed turns you into an assassin, then I could watch jurrasic park and be t-rex."
24333,all of those were FOX news
24334,"I am not a violent person but I have a short fuse, I use video games to vent my frustration using missions like ""no Russian"" to take out my anger without there being any consequences. If children who play these games understand what's happening in these games and accept the consequences of rein-acting the content what's the problem?"
24335,I'd rather have mentally ill people shooting people on a screen than in real life.
24336,"Anyone who says that violent video games cause violence in real life are complete idiots trying to find excuses for everything. I play GTA and battlefield and I am no more violent for it. I play to have fun; I know the whole time that the game is not real and that killing in real life is horrible. The only truth is that it might affect people with mental issues, but the real question there should be how we allow those people with mental issues to get guns and other weapons in real life."
24337,The news really gotta hit the DAMN FUCKIN brakes they only do this cuz nothing happens so what we play bloody games some do and the gamers and YOUTUBER gamers (the ones who play and put the game they played on YouTube) and we still today play FUCKIN BLOODY WAR GAMES  (and they did do a avatar last airbender game but they should do another one bigger and bader and same as the show)
24338,fox news is a great comedy tation
24339,video games dont cause violence there an outlet to get anger out if anything but there really just meant for fun and competion it realy pisses me off that politician and stupid conseritits use video games a scape goat because they dont want to face the real fucking issues
24340,I FUCKING HATE THAT SHIT THEY BLAME VIDEO GAMES ON MASS SHOOTINGS WHEN ITS THE MENTAL ILLNESS ON THE PROSECUTORS GOD
24341,Key work MENTAL ILLNESS
24342,P.S. Murica news wink wink
24343,Australia isn't called hell on Earth for nothing
24344,Yogscast Kim cameo :)
24345,video games and computers in general used to be the domain of extremely intelligent 'geeks' who were smart and handy enough to make these game work with non optimal setups..games like early leisure suit larrys would've gotten negative press like this had it not been only the smartest individuals who had it running on their 1991 apple..individuals smart enough not to take offense or make waves about such trivialities..when the pc game market and hardware/os/software/peripherals became dumbed down enough that mouth breathing chimps could pc then games a percentage as offensive as other earlier games suddenly became news
24346,Also the contreversy with Medal of Honor which was Usa vs. the other team in multiplayer. And on resident evil 5 where people got offended because Chris was shooting Africans
24347,GUYS I HAVE A PLAN! If we get rid of all video games... then we won't ever have any mass murders! Because there were no murders or killers before video games were invented!
24348,OF COURSE DOOM HAS SATANIC SHIT! It has the player fighting the fucking demons from Hell to save the world! I swear these morons in the media never even play these games...
24349,"i had no idea about no russians, until i play the mw2 mission lol.. kinda fun"
24350,"It's normal that this might affect Americans , they are over-sensitive and over-protective of their children , that's why their children are fat and unable to do anything . These games wouldn't affect any normal person."
24351,Don't you just love the media scaremongering? I've been playing violent video games for years but you don't see me killing anyone!
24352,that's SHIT
24353,"Why does cod take all the blame. Battlefield is more realistic (I play cod don't hate) why is it cod? To me battlefield players should be thanking us cod players for the ones taking the heat, not bashing our game, yes ghosts is bad. I'm not mad, please don't hate on this, yes it is the parents fault for having a weapon where the mentally unstable child can get them. These are all JUST QUESTIONS. Please add something if I have forgotten something."
24354,mortal kombat is #7?! that's nuts. that was a huge deal back in the day
24355,haven't watched vid yet. I'm predicting that number one is when everyone freaked out when Mortal Kombat came out
24356,Fox News just needs a scapegoat to blame video games for anything bad in the world.
24357,imagine if the people who thought mortal combat was violent saw modern games...
24358,"So the #1 video game controversy isn't a video game?
#1 should have probably been Super Columbine Massacre RPG!"
24359,"She said it! Mental illness is a BIG problem. And all we do is ignore them, jail them, or drug them. If video games are an issue, what about movies? HBO, Netflix, and the dozens of other ways that people intake this violence?
Why are we trying to stop this crap, lets stop the real life issues!"
24360,"Video games aren't the issue and those who blame them are as intelligent as a chimpanzee jabbing a fork into a electrical outlet. Video games aren't the problem and they never have been. It's idiot parents with poor parenting skills. The Connecticut shooting at the elementary school; the shooter was mentally retarded and ill, he wasn't a gamer and his mother bought him a gun. It's her fault for the shooting, she gave him the tool to enable the horrible crime, it wasn't video games. I could go on and on about the other cases like this but all I'm gonna get from some of you is nothing but grief and bullshit cuz instead of seeing the obvious truth you side with media who 95% of the time have their heads up their assets. Then it takes one idiot say something about video games and then all the sheep follow the idiots words and then you here about it on 7 different news stations...."
24361,"I see what the video is saying but at the same time it's not like these games are super clean there's too much pointless violence. You can't just act like there's nothing wrong at all. Some blame should go to video games but not all, most should go to the parents for allowing there kids to play these games."
24362,TELL THAT PREECEHR TO STFU POKEMON IS A DAMN GAME!! I SWEAR THEY THINK EVERY IS DEMONIC LIKE GTFO LBS!
24363,mw2 was incredible
24364,I honestly don't think shootings are a big controversial thing in the United States anymore.
24365,"True that there are some murderers who liked FPS's, but what about the tens of millions of gamers who do NOT kill real people?
Did these fear mongerers ever think that the people are murderers who like video games, and not gamers who like murder?"
24366,i just realized they only go after popular games
24367,"pokemon is a game of how to cast spells? i found no witchcraft in it. I must play it till i find some magic!!! :D
any one else realize only adults could find jynx's color racist( which makes me think the people who say it's racist are a little racist)
and then they lie and make a horrible parody game which makes them horrible for thinking or making that
because i see pokemon as another dimension with amazing creatures with special talents"
24368,"those people annoy me, they just blame all violent things on video games and other things because its about war and other things. Then they go and say it's ok to send soldiers in and have war, and get angry at the other country when soldiers from the USA die when they don't remember or support the soldiers or their families or the ones from the other countries who have families and friends. Also the parents shouldn't buy or let there child buy the game if they think it's to violent. they might just blame violence on books and comics next instead of taking responsibility for themselves."
24369,"Haha they're all idiots, talking about things they don't understand. I don't understand care homes, lets get rid of them."
24370,"It has nothing to do with video games, STOP LETTING CORPORATE AMERICA TELL U HOW TO RAISE UR FUCKING CHILKDREN< BE A HUMAN BEING AND FUCKING RAISE THEM UR SELF U FUCKING LOW LIFE BOTTOM DWELLERS"
24371,"Falujah IS STILL ALIVE, it is just called INSURGENCY"
24372,"If we look at the overall trend since Mortal Kombat (1992), we'll see that violent crime has actually DECREASED, so if there's one conclusion we can draw, it's that violent video games as a whole actually help get the violent side of us out in non-harmful ways."
24373,they should make a game where u and others go into a school and kill kids
24374,Hey about right wing nut jobs and left wing crybabies both shut the fuck up and leave our games alone! Can we shoot for that?!?!
24375,how about you tell me what the number 1 most controversial game was as you neglected to tell us the number 1 because of the news stuff
24376,"Yes, video games cause violence, there is obviously no other reason the crusaders murdered many innocent people because they played video games ri... No, I'm fairly sure they didn't even have a grasp on electricity back then."
24377,i like your voice better then the girl
24378,Studies show that Kids that play video games at a young age turn out to be very good problem solvers.
24379,No i play black op mw 3 and it do the same
24380,I swear that if I ever get to debate against the media on that video games cause violence I'm going to make the media look retarded
24381,"Which moments pissed me off? I'd say all of them. Don't know if anyone else feels the same, but I think they attack games after mass shootings because older generations are always looking for ways to make new technologies look bad and it draws attention away from bad parenting. Also, if people have such a big problem with these games, wouldn't not buying them be more moderate than spilling your hatred onto potential buyers? I shouldnt have to worry about being able to find a game because it offended some little pest."
24382,rated r movies are made for adults = rated m games same deal. so while these people are at it why don't they just bitch about every offensive art form untill there is nothing left! unbelievable
24383,Fucking media and how they use video games as a cause for real shootings
24384,"So if people were upset about the MW2 level of killing Russian citizens, how do they feel about in BO2 where you play as Menendez and kill American soldiers, or the level where you are Farid undercover and kill even more American soldiers? I mean I know they're not civilians, but stillyou end up killingyour own team."
24385,omg pokemon? really pokemon?
24386,"Fun fact about the MW2 mission, the original mission took place in an airport modeled after a real airport in Russia, until they deemed that too inapropriate"
24387,7:37 is total bullshit!!!!!
24388,I wish we lived in a world where people understood that a video game is not a reality and that no should baned!
24389,"Lets take a moment to remember all those who died following the epidemic of neatly stacking boxes that Tetris caused.
Video games = Murder!!!"
24390,"I hate to say this because I live in America but most Americans don't know how to take responsibility for they're own actions so they find something to blame like video games for using real guns. its just mid evil times all over again, you will be thrown in a river if you float you are a witch therefor we will bludgeon you with rocks if you sink I'm sorry you drowned."
24391,but the pokemon gambling was pretty addictive.lol
24392,"If violence is blamed on video games and its true, dont blame the person blame the parents for letting their child play GTA 5"
24393,I find it ironic that alot of the controversy was coming out of Fox News.
24394,3:50 - was that Kim from the yogscast?
24395,I think that making a true military based story like that into a game is a big no no.
24396,"Be glad that the videogames are a multi billion dollar industry. The industry has so much power that it can prevent laws that censor or block videogames from seeing the light of day. If some naive senator or congressman tries to introduce a bill that blocks or tries to censor games, our corporate buddies will come to the rescue."
24397,"Violence in video games I feel is what's keeping usfrom killing eachother. Back before we had fictional entertainment, we hanged people, watched them tortured and beheaded, had World Wars to fuel our bloodlust. Now, we have a virtual playground to vent, and countries that don't or disallow such fictional carnage are some of the most violent countries. Eyes set on the Middle East"
24398,"Bored, boring..."
24399,similar to died out comic book controversy and because it was so far off eventually they looked past the medias manipulation that actually enforced their claims unlike batman and robinI just hope massacres don't become legal in the next 60 years
24400,very strange I guess this is what encouraged treyarc to give resnov a bigger spotlight made me wanna know more bout Russia resnof was a bad ass
24401,the mass effect was bullshit stupid woman femenists and pretentious priks
24402,"All I've got to say, other than those in charge of Australia's games need to grow the hell up and the media should have a small inclination of what they're ""reporting"" on when it comes to games, is that the game Six Days in Fallujah looked more like a serious game meant to honor those who lost their lives in that war, not some fictitious kill 'em all kind of game like Call of Duty. Yes I know that there's more to Call of Duty than that, I'm just trying to prove my point and I'm saying that that's more what it feels like compared to what it was when it first started with Finest Hour and Big Red One."
24403,"Def agree with the MW2 Russian mission. Completely unnecessary. But who does the shooting? People. Who makes the violence? People. I have not once wanted to go steal cars after playing GTA, fight with people after playing Mortal Kombat, or shoot people after playing Call of Duty. Everyone wants to have something to blame. We should be blamed for not helping those who are creating these issues."
24404,"Typical media-fed ignorance. Do you understand that literally everybody can be classified as mentally ill according to the current DSM of the psychiatric community? And guess what that means? If fucking morons allow themselves to be convinced that mental illness is the key issue, in mass shootings, and that preventative measures must be taken, then legislation will be passed, and it will be possible for everyone to be prevented from owning a gun, and that is exactly what a handful of manipulative fucks want."
24405,its not video games that make us violent its everyday bullshit that has to do with REALITY not some fucking disc that goes into a console. The way i see it is that the only reason people kill other people is because of a psychological problem that was developed due to an abusive childhood or constant bullying or something long those lines
24406,"They take video games too seriously. I have many friends play 1st person shooters and other games such as GTA or Manhunt. But in reality, these games are just meant for fun. They allow the players to calm and have a good time playing. Video game creators have no intentions to manipulate child minds to do things like this. And it's not the video game's fault either. It's the parents. They're allowing little kids to play these types of games which are not meant for them."
24407,"Actually, the PSN break-in did not involve people taking credit card information AT ALL. That data was encrypted and stored on a different server. However, email addresses, homeaddresses, and PSN names were POTENTIALLY taken by the criminals. In reality, all they did was drop a text file on the server with a message to Sony."
24408,Fu
24409,"Always bright insight from ""fair and balanced FOX ""NEWS"""
24410,damn it news stop ruining all the games
24411,Fox News
24412,"This video pissed me of i mean games made for entertainment just because here happen to be a shooting you can't blame the video game and the mw2 one really annoyed me since it does this mission contains graphic violence do you want to skip what's next, you'll be a bank robber because you stole $100 in a game of monopoly"
24413,I blame the Govenment and Religion of causing violence. And I blame Video Games of letting me discount all my fury into the game instead of going around stabbing people with a Machete. And the News for sucking the Government's Dick.
24414,Minecraft is the root of all Mass Shootings! The vicious violence against pigs is to blame!
24415,"I vote yes on making games 18+, then games don't have to be censored. Game companies don't want this because then parents might wake up and not buy their 5-16 year old kid these mature games which would make them less money. Game companies would be more willing to produce more games with violence or sexuality if news companies/parents didn't attack it so much. When parents are SO surprised on how violent a Mature game is and complain about it, ticks me off. It doesn't shock me anymore since the reason is clear. Putting the blame on someone else is pretty easy and they don't want to be known as parents who don't know how to do their job so they shift the blame. Parents may say, ""It may be easy for you to say, but I have a full time job, chores, while also taking care of the kids."" Well if you don't have the time to do those things and worry about your kids, then you probably should not of had a kid in the first place!"
24416,"Cod is supposed to REPRESENT what it's like being in war fighting for what's right, but the media just turns it into people murdering for fun and laughing at it. What's next? Them saying Minecraft and Mario is racist? And that slender will turn you into a stalker and vandelizer? People play games in order to do the things that they know they can't do in real life"
24417,i fucking hate these game contraverses i mean they are just video games its not like playing gta will make you go out buy a gun and kill loads of people or playing pokemon will make you go make animals attack each other sure there is a lot of violent scenes in video games but who cares that's what the rating system is for (although no one follows it including me) and i think that anyone who believes in these contraverses is just being plain stupid.
24418,thats annoying that war game looked realy cool
24419,"You can't run away from violence, so that's why most of these games are here for to make fun OF violence, especially GTA its just shoving in your face tones and tones of parodic but yet violent humor. Most of these creators of those games make it that violent to piss off people who are very sensitive about it. It's like any movie or book if it has your attention you bought into it not the people who made it."
24420,Why the fuck would the spastic US/AUS Government censor a VIDEO GAME!? A game that was meant for entertainment? Just happy to live in the fucking UK...
24421,"ive played mk9 on the ps3 and quite honestly, the fatality back in the day were much more violent. im looking at my shelf of games rated T-M and it's not violent at all. idk why the media even bothers blaming us gamers."
24422,i think its more disrespectful to the soldiers when they are brought out or used like a propaganda campaign. they chose their lives. and to be used against something like this is disrepectful to those who live and died for us.
24423,"I was seriously pissed off when I heard that the media was blaming violent video games for shootings. I'm not a big fan of FPS games, but I have played a fair share of graphic violent games, and I turned out fine. Would they also say that Monopoly make us successful in business? Or that playing The Sims make us murderous (come on, who doesn't kill a few Sims every now and then)? It's bogus."
24424,"0:19 Video games need a warning on them? Like the ESRB rating system Steve Doocy? 5:17 And Gretchen Carlson... oy...(sigh)... Oh Fox & Friends, you sad, pea brained ditzes. If only you worried about the wrong people getting their hands on guns... the same way you worry about the ""wrong"" people getting their hands on video games, healthcare, welfare, etc. See what I did there?"
24425,The media are faqs they always blame games let's say kid stabbed his arm they blame games
24426,Omg people are dumb it's a game fuck off
24427,"lol 0:56 ""most realistic sex acts ever conceived"". Well I guess kevin is a virgin then"
24428,"The best way to kill a video game, is to simply ignore it. By granting it media attention, it will sell more copies."
24429,The media has too much time on their hands.
24430,"It makes no sense when people blame acts of violence on games. I've played games where I kill for fun, commit just about every crime there is and in some games yes I'll have sex with another character. You don't see me going crazy and killing people on the streets."
24431,"Fucking bullshit. So many games gone to the bin. Because these parents, these fucking activists can't shut their damn mouths. It's a game, not like it's damn real and they're literally going to punch your goddamn head off or something. Jesus. Some people are just so stupid."
24432,"Stupid, most of people who talk negative about video-games (in this video, but might be true for everything else too) know little or nothing about it.
Football has caused mass riots that have killed many people, why don`t we ban that?"
24433,Humanity is the biggest controversy.
24434,i can agree that the Australian classification system fucking sucks and i want it to be more like the US one but no they have to fucking does this shit
24435,As an Australian I am particularly frustrated with the ratings not allowing Saints Row IV off the bat while they have let GTAV straight through. I understand that the lvel of seriousness is different but it's just plain ridiculous
24436,"Don't blame the game. The shooting are a shame.
But It's not the games fault that the shooter have a mental illness."
24437,"Australia's rating system is so BS, If they don't like what's in it put an R18 rating on it."
24438,rly america blame video games for rl massacres..maybe dont let ppl buy so easy realy weapons?
24439,"I love how news reporters always point out that a person who commits a mass-murder played games like ""World of Warcraft."" It's obvious they've never even LOOKED at WoW if they think THAT ONE is the catalyst for the horrible things they've done."
24440,"Ok so i'm Australian, i am so fucking sick of the pricks who ruin our entertainment, they have released movies with more gore and sexual content. Like Jesus fucking christ it is just a game, GET OVER IT. honestly L4D2 is not the same without the gore and all that, it feels very watered down. and Saints Row IV, you have an OPTION to use the Anal Probe Weapon, there is no part in the game, that i'm aware of, that requires you to to use this. Micheal Atkinson need to get the stick out of his ass and realise that it is just for entertainment. I do realise that he is doing it for out protection but read the second half of the first sentence."
24441,Blame video games for their fail parenting.
24442,notice how a majority of the complaints are coming from fox news
24443,i wanna play manhunt
24444,"Nice thing to close on, but who was the gal that said it?"
24445,"pokemon...really....out of all the games in this world, pokemon..."
24446,I have Manhunt 2 for the Wii. It's boring and the controls suck.
24447,what about postal 2???
24448,"what's the difference in watching saving private ryan, and playing a game set in ww2. what's the difference in watching texas chainsaw massacre, and playing manhunt. what's the difference in watching a porno and seeing sex in a video game? it's all bullshit.stop blaming the gaming industry rated M is for mature meaning do not buy for ur stupid kid, that's why everytime you play an online game thats for 18yrs or older, theres always that 6-12yr old kid on there. = dumb ass parent, probably doesn't care. FOX NEWS blame them, I hate Fox news."
24449,"KIM, wait, they really think that pokemon is demonic REALLY"
24450,"So... Basically, this should just be a top 1 list?
1. Dinosaurs trying to keep us in the 20th century since the 20th century."
24451,"You can play through the No Russian mission without ever shooting civilians. My brother and I did on our playthroughs. You do, however, have to shoot the guards once you get out of the building."
24452,#1 is annoying. yes links to counter strike was with the combine shooting (or what ever it was called) and the sandy hook one was with a kid with an interest in mass shootings (his favorite game must be mw 2) but don't go pointing the blame on people who rather sit in front of a screen as a pass time instead of doing such acts.
24453,what about resident evil 5? pretty controversial
24454,"Thieving bastard politicians must love video games. Anytime they fuck up, they can use it as a diversion and make people forget about the real problems going on.
Violence has been around since ancient times. It's nothing new."
24455,Video games are for entertainment so ppl need to stop taking this shit too seriously
24456,"Seems legit. We lost few men in Fallujah, but I honor those who died. It's not fair that they ban this, when we get vietnam and WWII games. You can't just automatically assume this game is to mock the military. It tells the story of what happens."
24457,Published on my Birthday :)
24458,Lol! Fox news and the GoP make everything a controversy...
24459,"Holy shit! Dude, you're very good to comment on the news!"
24460,gta5
24461,"the people who blame games for real life events are just naive. they ignore scientific research and straight up facts. I play call of duty at my friend's house a whole lot, but neither me or him have ever killed anyone or have even gotten near a gun."
24462,"the man from florida who shall not be named...... we all, hate you jack"
24463,I think that the 7 year old shooting should have been on somewhere of coresit is all GTA's fault not that a gun was in a kids reach
24464,people think games causes this explain this when there weren't games
24465,mad father!
24466,"I remember when Cap guns were the rage when I was a kid. Personally, despite the warning on the box, I feel it's more psychologically going to affect a child than a video game. EVEN then I blame parents. Parents don't know the difference between a rated M game to a rated E game. These games have specific content details underlining what that game is about and even a detail of what the game displays. If you honestly think just because a kid plays a video game he is going to be a killer, blame the parents for not censoring and warning the child about the content, it's their responsibility as parents to monitor their child's behavior. This is why there is parental control, passwords, and all other sorts of methods. Also this is why, when I was a child, when Cartoon Network played an ad for an online game it said ""please ask for your parents permission before going online"". Why? because then the parents can set up malware removal, run security scans to protect their computer and adjust parental settings. Even as an adult, you alone as an adult have to monitor your own thoughts and feelings and your friends should also monitor if any of these games are indeed getting to your head. Again, it's not only choice but there are specific labels that tell whether or not the game is appropriate for the user."
24467,Obviously Kevin McCullpough never played/found the god of war easter eggs
24468,#1 I like shooter games but your not going to see me go on a flipping shooting rampage. Obviously it's people who are mental
24469,My jaw dropped at #3
24470,The slaying of sandy hook elementary.... I fucking hate it.
24471,you think video games cause violence? please explain all the violence that happened in the last few million years.
24472,"Six Days in Fallujah being cancelled is stupid, in my opinion. What the parents are basically saying is ""hey, you can't make a video game about war because someone died in that war."""
24473,"Let's just keep playing politics WM..way to go...
"" pushed mostly by conservative news outlets"" followed by showing clip after clip of liberal news outlets blaming games on mass shootings"
24474,i HATE stupid people who like to destroy fun i want to scare them so bad they shiz them selfs on tv showing what jerks they are.
24475,grand theft auto is cool
24476,"Man, I think my favorite game has to be, oh, I don't know, the Slaying of Sandy Hook (just go search that up)."
24477,"They probably should have kept making Battle of Fallujah, the controversy would have doubled its sales, plus after the game was actually released (which they didn't even wait to see what the game was like before they condemned it) they could actually prove that they were trying to present a story that would respectfully show what soldiers went through. Then win/win for them. Although people would still raise hell because they don't understand video games.They probably thought it was just going to be Frogger with dead bodies floating down the river instead of logs."
24478,people can't do anything today without making someone offended. They're video games?Really??people get upset over this??
24479,No I live in Australia
24480,People need to grow up!
24481,"With the hundreds of million people that play video games, a select few have decided to go on shooting sprees, so obviously they're linked. You know, cause everyone that has cancer has at one point breathed air, so obviously air creates tumors. Everyone knows that.(EXTREME AMOUNTS OF SARCASM, in case you didn't catch that.)
   It takes a special kind of asinine ignorance to assume that having a press badge makes you capable of informing others. If video games caused violent acts, with how many people play cod, halo, gow, mass effect, or so on, there would be way more, and I mean way more acts of violence going around.
   Cars kill far more people than guns every year, but not a single group that I could name lobbies for ""no cars on the street."" How convenient, that necessity out weighs tragedy. I'm not saying cars are bad, but video games aren't either.
   The number one cause of death, is life, so why whine about it. In a world run by statistics and laws -- insert ""the Joker"" here-- ""every one loses their minds"" when a free radical appears. People need to stop trying to understand every little thing about life and accept the simplest and truest statement ever made: sometimes, s#!t happens. Grow up and move on."
24482,"If the video games people played made them into what they are, i'm pretty sure a huge number of people would be farmers. (farmville)"
24483,"People always bit$* about stupid shit like violence in video games or in movies or blah blah blah if video games weren't around they would blame all the shootings and crap on movies and if movies were not around they would blame it on music and if music wasn't around they would blame it on bad parenting or they would say its because of different races or different religions that we have violence. People whine and piss and moan about the stupidest things. Oh no a game referenced war that's bad or oh no a guy was smoking a joint in that movie and it made my kid start smoking pot. Human beings are animals and like all animals were violent only difference is we are violent for no reason or stupid reasons. Animals are only violent or only kill when its for food or to protect there young and family. Human beings kill for stupid reasons like money religion race war or because someone called them a name or said there ugly or made fun of them in school. The really funny thing is human beings murder there fellow human beings and then try to justify it with stupid reasons like oh this war is necessary or oh that guy stepped on my shoe he assaulted me so i had to chop his head off or rather they kill for religious reasons and say there doing gods will. There is so much more violence spawned and caused by religion and racism but they never report on that they always try to blame it on the movies or say the suspect or suspects played video games or had allot of horror movies or that its because they watch Anime or something stupid when the plain and simple answer is humans are the most violent animals in existence and they don't commit violent acts because of a movie they saw or because of a game they played there just violent and sure once in a while some extremely violent human sees something in a movie or a game that gets his rocks off and says hey I'm going to go do this. But the fact is that even if that game or movie was not made the same person would just go do something violent regardless and if the media or some politician sees something they can relate the violent act to they will. For example if the murder involved a person with non white skin they would blame it on some movie or game where a non white person was killed. And of course you will see people dislike my post and say oh i know someone who was killed because of a violent movie or video game but again people are violent animals who kill there own kind for no reason or stupid reasons then there are people who exploit the poor people who were killed and use there death to fuel anti game campaigns or anti movie campaigns or to fuel some religious movement like how they said Pokemon was satanic with witchcraft and blah blah blah when its just a game where you catch creatures and befriend them, and anything can sound negative if you put a negative spin on it. Also FYI Pokemon was originally called pocket monsters. Here is an example on how anything can sound bad if you say its bad or only point out the bad stuff that happens because of it. Religion is bad and will get you sent to hell because every religion wants you to kill in the name of your god and hate anyone who doesn't think just like you or who doesn't follow your gods rules, if we didn't have religion there would be no more violence in the world because people always kill in the name of there god and say that i am doing gods will or they say the devil made me do it, religion is the cause of all the problems in the world and why there is so much violence in the world. Now here is an example of how anything can sound good if you only point out the good. Religion makes the world a better place, it helps people get through the bad times and it helps people find there way when there lost. Religion helps people be good and good to others and it also makes people better for having it as a part of there lives, if there was more religion in the world and more people had faith and accepted some sort of god into there hearts and souls there would not be any more violence in the world. See anyone can put a positive or negative spin on anything you cant take the medias or one or two peoples person views or opinions on something to heart you have to think for yourself and experience and judge something for yourself. Also i hate people who say oh my house was robbed and i don't like how people think its funny to do that in games like GTA its not right when the truth is they just want to tell there sob story and make people feel sorry for them and get people to hate something that had nothing to do with what happened to them. I have been mugged in real life and i still enjoy playing games like GTA or other games. People need to stop complaining about how other people live there lives and the games they play and the movies and shows they watch, because the truth is if something horrible happens to you I'm sorry but that sucks and that's how life is, your not the only person who horrible things happen to, just because some bad crap happened to you doesn't mean you have to go on a rant on how its wrong for other people to get enjoyment out of games that have things in it that happened to you, if you don't like it then don't play the games or look up any information on them and don't watch those kinds of movies or shows."
24484,"8:40 The best statement I've ever heard for someone defending video games. You ma'am are too correct. And I thank you for having some damn sense and speaking the truth. So many politicians and people with their heads up their ass constantly neglect the fact that you rarely find a mass shooter, whether it is an adolescent or an adult without some type of mental illness or instability. Constantly pointing the finger at games like grand theft auto, COD, Mortal Kombat, etc, is the same as pointing the finger at some ofthese killers who just so happen tolisten to Marilyn Manson, Eminem, Slayer, etc. It's done before even with comic books that were graphic and could be seen suggestive towards something negative. I agree certain games, lyrics, and images in movies, tv shows and even comics can be really graphic, I know Doom always gave me chills, but it is all based on perception and what the hell is going on in your head. Another thing people tend to disregard is how well the parents taught their children about morality and general common sense and a sense for having somebit of humanity in their bones. Funny how you're so quick judge someone else's work that they deem as art and a form of entertainment but neglect to take a look at your own job as a parent or guardian. Who's really the one at fault here?"
24485,why do they never talk about violence in movies and on tv when these people go on shooting sprees?
24486,I wonder why media get so butthurt over games when movies show way waaaay worse stuff. And most of the times they dont even know what they talk about.
24487,"gta 5 is not condemned by americans coz its a money maker, yet you can kill loads of innocents if you choose ,who didn sign up for war,then a wargame gets cancelled before its made as a scapegoat to keep some people who cant even play happy,maybe it wasn't meant to be made"
24488,why did the battle of Fallujah game get bad press. Why because people lost their lives. But historic war games are fine. Stupid people that game would of been cool to know about that battle. People are so stupid.
24489,"someone just sue peta
they're bunch of drugged hippi bastards who can't have a good time, i hope everyone agrees with me on what i'll go on to say:
i'm find with the fact that they don't like it, but don't be a bunch of pricks and start ripping off games, pokemon isn't some fucked up blood sport, they don't die, they don't even appear to get hurt that much apart from fainting with no visible injuries, same with mario, it's OBVIOUSLY not a raccoon skin in mario 3, AND EVEN IF IT WAS WHO CARES? mario stops living mushrooms (the main food of everyone in peta) and jumps on turtles, oh and what about the frog suit, they only care about the furry animals?
oh and THEN there's the fucker's worst crime yet, making super ""tofu"" boy
i'm just happy that team meat mocked these vegan twats by making him shit in the game.
someone, please, SHUT THESE SATANIC NUTJOBS DOWN, if we wanna eat meat, WE'LL FUCKING EAT MEAT, we wanna kill animals, IT'S BEEN LIKE THAT FOR GENERATIONS, WHY STOP NOW?
and don't even get me started on A.R.M, (animal rights militia) poisoning people? are those fuckers TRYING to get people to eat meat? they make it look like vegitarians are all violent pricks who ether stand outside super markets throwing red pain on fur coats OR they smash up labs, poison people and ROB THE GRAVES OF FACTORY OWNERS WHO MADE THINGS LIKE DOD FOOD"
24490,WOMAN! You can be a female SHEPARD!
24491,"While I have and haven't played some of these games, I absolutely hate it when people blame video games for this new era of violence. I don't want to hurt anyone, and I don't want to be a terrorist (although sex would be nice :-)). Children grew up for decades playing all sorts of other games that could nowadays be misconstrued for violence such as war and cops and robbers, and everything was hunky dory for the most part (minus the three wars started by that generation). A lot of parents that I have talked to even disagree with the new's opinion too. Lastly, even if I don't play certain games because they're not my type, I still support their existence."
24492,6 days in fellujah was pulled cause real soldiers lost their lives? What about medal of honor. Normandy beach.
24493,Surely RapeLay should be on there.
24494,"The murderer drank water, thus all who drink water are murderers!!!"
24495,"People don't realize how sick they are. They have reach the point of having fun by killing people in a video game, or having sex like in GTA San Andreas. I miss the old games, when programmers weren't this sick."
24496,"The smartest thing parents can do nowadays is look at the ESRB ratings that is what the rating is for.There is an ""M"" 17+ rating on the front, back and game instruction manual. I've read stories from store clerks that parents buy games like Grand Theft Auto 5 and Battlefield 3 for their nine or twelve year old child, come back and complain that the game is too violent for their kids. What is even more funny is parents will watch crap like Miley Cyrus music videos and not complain about her."
24497,No Herobrine?
24498,People look for every little tiny morsel of something to be offended by! What's wrong with people!? It's a kids game!
24499,Pokemon world of the satanic my ass!
24500,"the media is so fucking dumb... that's why they are losing to the internet at such a fast pace... you will find all the news you want IN AN ACURATE FORM even days before the media gets to pick it up, in the form of a gossip by the way"

guess duke nukem forever and playboy the mansion"
24504,mass effect is not banned in USA lol
24505,"I love Australia, video games are evil and should be banned all together!
If only Michael Atkinson had more power to ban all games then Australia would be a peaceful place with absolutely 0% crime"
24506,It pisses me off the most when they blame video games for mass murders. I believe that they blame video games for things they don't have control of or don't understand. I also believe that most people want a wrong answer when they don't want to hear the real answer.
24507,What's the game at 2:27?
24508,"Just finished Pokemon guys, let's go cast some torture spells on animals !"
24509,"I remember in 2004 in Poland there was a controversy with Stormregion game ""Codename: Panzers - Phase One"". Before the release Stormregion released a couple of screens from the game and briefiengs. There was a one with the fake, which propadlly were for the better roleplay as Wehrmacht officer, order which stated that german army is responding for the polish troops crossing the Third Reich border (simply meaning the Poland started WW2).
And maaaaaan it started. So many people write so much crap, like the game shows Poles as drunk and cowards, that in the game you play as Waffen SS and kill civilian and on and on. Even the former president of Warsaw Lech Kaczyski, like he always do, called to boycott this game. But almost NOBODY even BOTHER to get a copy of actual game or even check on the Stormregion website."
24510,some people are just to way sensitive.
24511,All of them
24512,Would have expected that Pokemon-bit from the intro being explained in the actual video as it looks like legit footage...
24513,come on there just games fuck
24514,bullshit pokemon is awesome
24515,People need to stop bitching the world is so fucked up and you blame it on one game
24516,I fucking hate it when News channels start to talk about how the shooter of a mass shooting would always blame video games. Wouldn't it be common sense when you could tell the difference between a video game and real life? Wouldn't they check if they were mentally unstable or just wasn't right in their head?
24517,"u guis forgot hotline miami. im not sure if that is controversial, but it might be. it still is a AMAZING game"
24518,"Um, they do that it is a game? It has no reality based. Must looking for a epic story to tell. It is easier to blame the media, which is in fact controlled by the parents. I know that a lot of parents have no idea what there buying for their kids. When these parents ask me is it a good game to buy.
I say is it for you?
No.
Is it for your kid?
Yes.
How old?
ten
than no.
But sometimes the parents don't want to listen to facts. See these game publishers are creating games for themselves not for little johnny. It's a mess"
24519,"Here's the thing: violent people play video games, video games don't make people violent. Now, I'm not saying that everyone who plays video games is violent, I'm just saying that the people who play violent video games a lot and are violent were violent before the video games came into play."
24520,"I play games to shoot people so I don't go shoot people. Nah, it's all about story. Some video games can be considered artistic, but of course, the bad always speaks louder than the good."
24521,"5:21 yeah lady? well how about those dozens of video games about World War 1 and 2? In which death tolls reached hundreds of thousands? Didn't get a lot of backlash about those, did we?
While we're at it, why not say Stratego the board game is offensive, because it makes child's play of the real life battlefield?"
24522,I hated the controversy of black ops 2 I almost couldn't get it because of that
24523,Thank you for being the only media outlet to cover this subject equally and mostly unbiased.
24524,"Let's use some media logic. My uncle owns a Barrett .50 I also play Call of Duty. Therefore, I must be preparing toassassinatethe president and every member of Nato."
24525,i love how all the complaints came from fox news lol
24526,"When There is ever a shooting, murdering, anything wrong, they ALWAYS blame video games. I Play A Shit Ton Of GTA V, and I don't go around jacking every car I see, robbing Every 7/11 in New York. No! The Media is BULLSHIT!"
24527,Hated that bitch that was talking about mass effect sex scenes. I saw it live. None of it was true and she admitted to not ever playing the game so how can you even have a pov let alone talk on Fox News.
24528,I saw this one comment somwhere that said minecraft was one of the most violent games ever when there is no blood in it unless you mod it
24529,Had to put this somewhere where were the badgames that influenced people 500 years ago or more where they choped off peoples heads and people came and watched?

24533,"On the subject of ""Battle of Fallujah"", it was actually created in order to remember the battle, not disgrace it."
24534,0:21 gee it's not like these games have an ESRB rating or anything? Am I right?
24535,"I can stand these news highlights who blame shootings on video games, they just want to get out a quick story and don't even care to find out what actually happened. It's like ""OMG that guy has a gun and he happened to own a video game, but wait those video games also have guns in them. Alright boys we got a story."" Come the fuck on! Maybe...just maybe they had a mental illness, did they ever think that."
24536,Australia doesn't like anal probes because apparently they have too many sticks up their ass's already.
24537,"Uh-oh, I guess I'm some evil, sadistic murderer now since I play FPS games."

24540,What about Postal 2?
24541,"all the cops i work with play videogames so should they be stripped from duty cause of potential crimes, its just like when you do drugs some people freak out, some eat all your food"
24542,That portal 2 adoption thing was just plain stupid
24543,"video games kill people? well how about a big sack of cancer down your throat?
water kills people too but you're not banning that... fucking retards ( not ment for you WatchMojo )"
24544,"I don't even play pokemon and I think #9 is so fucking stupid.
Yes mindless fanboys want pokemon to be real, but unless you have other mental problems nobody's gonna try and capture animals in a small ball"
24545,"Pokemon teaches kids to cast spells? I realize I haven't played the most recent games but... how the hell do you go from 'little animal things that fight each other' to 'WORLD OF THE DEMONIC'? I get the connection to witchcraft and Harry Potter (I think it's silly, but at least I understand the thought process) but Pokemon?????.... where the hell is the connection?"
24546,"So, what I got from this is that the people in Congress and the news networks are a bunch of fuckwads who talk out of their ass about something they have no clue about so they can seem important."

24551,"People have been killing people since before video games, movies, or TV."
24552,"I am sick of the parents on the news ranting about ""This game is too violent and I think it should be banned"" but there is a really simple solution: DON'T LET YOUR KIDS PLAY IT! And when news reporters blame video games for shootings, they just want something easy to blame it on. They're too lazy to investigate to what caused it, so they just say, ""Oh we know it was video games"" but that's BS because you don't know, you're just assuming because you're too lazy to get off your lazy rear and INVESTIGATE!"
24553,oh my fucking god i mean WTF? i don't give a fuck about your son! this a mother fucking game yo
24554,"I honestly think that parents who complain about violent video games becuase they don't want their kids to know are just lazy, like seriously you can't just keep them away from it?"

24556,"Anyone hear about how PETA was saying Mario encouraged killing creatures and skinning them? The tanooki suit in Mario was said to be a reference to the Tanooki ""raccoon dog"" in Japan. Another Youtuber, Brentalfloss mentions this."
24557,Conservative news media as they show msnbc in the background. Lawl.
24558,"So conservatives don't like violent video games? Then you show Chris Matthews and other MSNBC pundits... When it's been the Liberal media who have been actively trying to quell free speech, video games and rights to bare arms."
24559,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but the first video game invented came out in 1958. So technically, guns were never used against people before 1958, right?
I guess my history teacher and all history books are full of lies. All wars occurred after 1958, and people like Billy the Kid never existed.
The same people that are so heavily influenced by video games are going to be the same people that are heavily influenced by fortune cookies, writing on the bathroom stalls or by some ridiculous dream they had."
24560,wow it is official san andreas is the best gta!
24561,"witch game is at 3:25 to 3:31??
anyone??"
24562,geez people hate war games why not just ban every war game ever (plz don't its a joke)
24563,Lol pokemon thats the funniest one
24564,"FPS video games do not cause real life shootings. Just look at Japan. Japan has just as violent [and sometimes even more violent] video games as the United States but there are WAYYY less shootings over there because they have strict gun laws. omg I hate when people blame real life violence on video games. Given, the call of duty 'no russians' bit is really shocking, but because it is skip-able, I feel like it's not really as bad. If you had to go through the game and kill the pedestrians, I feel like that would be a step too far. I know that if I ever played that CoD game [which I wouldn't because CoD is terrible] I wouldn't go through with that part because it really is horrific, but I don't think the entire CoD franchise should suffer for a scene that is in bad taste.
(These are just my opinions on the subject, I'm not trying to argue with anyone or start a fight so please don't get offended by my personal views.)"
24565,"Manhunt 2? The first MANHUNT by Rockstar Games was worse. Where you can ""saw"" a guys head off with razor wire, or stabbing them in the eyes with shards of glass, none of it censored...and it came out way back in 2003! I still don't see or hear about it, to this day."
24566,WOW WTF is with American press so over the top!
24567,"So, video games do NOT cause violent offences. As they mentioned, there is little empirical evidence to support that gaming causes violence and there are a hell of a lot more studies that suggest that video games are unrelated to violent offences"
24568,"i knew ""No Russian"" would be on there"
24569,The media are idiots and jump on things they know nothing about.
24570,"I'm probably going to get a lot of hate mail for this, but I think Six Days in Fallujah should have been made. There are games like Battlefield, Call of Duty, and Medal of Honor, and nobody pays them that much mind. The only shooters I felt really showed us the horrors of war was Call of Duty 4 and Battlefield 4. That's just my opinion though, what do you guys think?"
24571,"In regards to #1, I hear talking heads on the MSNBC side of the table run their mouths too, guys. Be fair."
24572,"I'm 17 and when I used to watch and play pokemon animal abuse never came to mind! If anything it taught me to love animals! I remember in the show bonds between trainer and pokemon were always emphasized, the vid game too."
24573,05:30... that bitch.
24574,some people are just soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo stupid
24575,what about the double shot from zelda twilight princess.
24576,wow blaming real shootings on people playing shooting games is so pathetic and just goes to show that they dont actually have a clue.
24577,i would like to see a game where you actually perform a mass school shooting but i think it would get cancelled before it could be developed just like the Fellujah game.
24578,So many moralfags in americas tv
24579,"Lol they blame games for murders and crimes...well people have been killing wayyy before games were released ..and really parents too,there is a damn rating on the video game yet they still purchase the game....later on complains.??"
24580,"You lost all of your creditably by saying that it's only conservatives that want to ban video games, especially when you showed clips from MSNBC as well. Have you never heard of Jack Thompson? He's in the top tier list of people against video games and he's on that network all of the time. Banning things is a thing that big government does. Conservatives do not like big government. Get your facts straight."
24581,"Both Liberals and Conservatives blame videos games.
The NRA doesn't want the blame put on them and ignorants want an excuse for why people do bad things."
24582,"While the rest of the world suffers from starvation, war, and ultimately death, Americans find these things funny, especially when they get to do it in video games."
24583,"No Warriors.... Really? That is the only game I wasn't allowed to play as a kid. You mug people, rob stores and cars, graffiti, beat and stab people, and snort narcotics to get health, not to mention ever other sentence had a curse word"
24584,So true it's always the video games fault if there is a shooting but in games like Assassins creed and Cod you lose for shooting civilians even in MW2 if you shoot civilians in other levels you fail video games don't cause shootings people where killing and shooting each other a long time before any video games came out
24585,AAAAAAAAAAAG! I HATE THE MEDEA! >:O
24586,People need to stop bitching.Nuff said.
24587,Med-x in fallout 3 and later in fallout new vegas was originally called morphine but changed because Australia refused to sell the game.
24588,I can't believe that people blame gta for violent crimes I think it gives people a safe controlled atmosphere to do what they want I play gta all the time and have never killed anybody
24589,poof
24590,When they said you 'cast spells' about Pokmon that pised me off F#CK UM UP
24591,"By ""Press"" it only shows FOX NEWS, haha its insane how retarded they are."
24592,Don't people know that they are just video games
24593,"it pisses me off how fox blames video games on shootings and shit, but support the jackasses who want a gun in everyones' hand"
24594,fucking politics need to leave video games alone!!! let the rating labels do the work!!
24595,1:35 is that guy fucking serious?????! NO WHERE IN POKEMON DOES IT SHOW WITCHCRAFT AND VOODOO!!
24596,fuck fox news
24597,when people say grand theft auto incouriges rape
24598,"I fucking love Manhunt and Manhunt 2, yet I'm always so careful with knifes and scared of guns, what is wrong with me?"
24599,People always blame games because it is easier
24600,Somebody should make a game of the Sandy hook massacre.
24601,People just cant be evil now adays.
24602,"All of these mature oriented video games inspiring people to do stuff like hurting or something has been proven wrong a group who has been studying that for 10 years, fuck these medias. And fuck Fox Corporations to for making video games look bad, well they are a stupid company. :/"
24603,"Why do people get so butthurt about video games... if you don't like them, don't buy them."
24604,Blaming the games is like blaming the cars for car crash i think
24605,are we forgetting Postal 2?
24606,The controversies of videogames ended when they started to wear a nice +18 rating. End of discussion
24607,"Where is Postal 2, you know one of the most violent video games ever? It's banned in 13 country's."
24608,SHUT THE FUCK UP FOX NEWS!!!
24609,That woman in the end was so right on. You can't just blame video games for everything that goes wrong in this world.
24610,number 3 was just horrible who is the idiot who came up with that mission
24611,"things blamed and talked about after Mass Shootings:
Guns
Violent Video games
Things not blamed and never talked about after mass shootings
Mental state of shooter
Relationship with Parents
How shooter was Raised.
Relationship between shooter and other persons."
24612,"What I think is funny is that you used to go to a rated R movie and be able to see a fully naked woman (maybe you still can, I haven't been to the movies in awhile), but on TV it's considered less intimidating and more acceptable to show blood and gore. Oh, it's fine if kids accidently run into a gorey comedy show or horror movie, but when there's bare tits the censorship gets all offended. If I were a parent, I would rather my child accidentally walk in on porn than a twisted gorefest. Sex is natural compared to murder. What's so wrong with sexuality? God damn."
24613,Lol @ Stephen Merchant
24614,"Really? Your #1 is... Okay. I see it. People do bitch and moan about that. But where is JFK: Reloaded? I do recall that was a HUUUUGE controversy when it came out. And, unlike most of these, the opponents of that one actually had a point."
24615,I think I hate all kinds of media. They're all equally retarded about this kind of stuff.
24616,"Sure, the violence may have been in Mortal Kombat, but that's no excuse to found the ESRB. Forcing game developers to rate their games according to arbitrary standards is wrong. Plain and simple. If you don't like violent video games, don't buy them. The ESRB needs to be abolished."
24617,"People are so Fucking Dense, if one person gets offended they have to take it to the news and get other people to get on there sides. Even if they say that a school shooting happened because of a video game. As a gamer i played a lot of games that had killing in it but i never went to my school and shot my friends, people just need something to blame stuff on and mostly its the video games."
24618,I say NOT having my video games makes me pretty fucking violent.
24619,leave it to fox news to up the fear some more..
24620,"Horrible, you didn't include Carmageddon, Wolfenstein 3D or DOOM in the list - just included 2 of those games as notable when they caused more controversy than any of those games on the list. Whoever made this list is fucking stupid... but oh wait, it has to be newer games for the kiddies!"
24621,"hey look mum I just cut this mans head off and spat down his neck ..
hmm yes that's fine honey
hey mum I just hired a hooker and she did thigns that I couldn't see because it was cencored and bluured out And wasn't really shown
hmmmmm !!! game is banned"
24622,Video games really have been the scapegoat of media lately
24623,"I think I'm going to enter a code in my cell phone to spawn a tank and go on a rampage. Later, I'll shoot ice balls from my bare hands and freeze people, then knock their heads off. All I have to do is lose about 150 lbs. to be able to walk around; but video games are so violent, they give me magical powers, so losing that weight will be no problem!"
24624,fucking religions
24625,fucking conservatives
24626,"Well if you people are offended then just ignore the game than going around telling the whole world, probally including africa."
24627,The only difference between an shooting video game and an action movie is that you get to be the main character. It is basically the same thing and feel.
24628,"Even TF2 makes fun of Australia's ratings. One possible Soldier domination quote against a Sniper is ""Your country did not prepare you for the level of violence on this battlefield!"".
Hmm... no mention of Germany's policy towards games? I've heard from a German friend that it tends to be violence that gets censored and sex left alone, and I personally think that's more of a correct attitude than the USA and Australia. Well, I say that.... no censoring would appear to be the better option, imo."
24629,What is the name of the game in 3:34?
24630,I thought that Postal 2 should have been mentioned in the news more.
24631,"If they really think that video games are responsible for real violence they should have payed more attention in history class. For instance romans did some pretty nasty stuff, I wonder what video games they had been playing..."
24632,"""Oh no! GTA has a sex scene, my child might see that when he's playing!
Solution - Dont let your child play the fucking '18 +' rated game"
24633,"Fahrenheit's interactive sex scene, that got some attention. But it's renaming was stupid, they thought it was too close to Fahrenheit 9/11 so it was changed, idiots. but Alan Titchmarsh's attempt at hating was the worst."
24634,That Modern Warfare one makes me sick!
24635,Yay Kim from Yogstcast!
24636,I live in australia and i own saints row 4 i bought the game at gunnedah in new south wales.
24637,"In the German version of that MW 2 scene when you shoot somebody it says ""Mission failed, you mustnt shoot civilians"" ;)"
24638,Six days in Fallejuh would of been awesome. Just like the WW2 games history is history and its something we could learn from
24639,"Games aren't to blame for shootings, it's the fucked up governments and senators not enforcing heavier gun laws, although we have biker gangs that shoot up the dumbest of other gangs, Australia hasn't had a major massacre since 1996, that's almost 20 years ago. Since the formation of America; gang violence, racial acts, mentally ill cunts and kids who are too fucked up in the head, have got easy access to guns in the U.S.
Bring on the pissed off rednecks and trigger-happy freshmen from the army, because there's a 100% chance that one of them will be butthurt."
24640,"so what, are they just gonna blame all of the shootings on mental illnesses or are they going to blame it on the game making companies?"
24641,#1 definitely deserves its spot.
24642,i love video games but i know what games to play and not to play and you don't see me killing anyone
24643,"those danm politics blaming games? fricken thats why they have ratings for a danm reason. the reason is the parents of how they raise their kids. with just moral teachings, dicipline. monkey see monkey do, that stuff is the problem. so dang ignorant. i cant believe they are blaming video games for this crap. its stupid, i play hella a lot of voilent video games and im not psycho, u see me killing people ? no , its knowing whats reality and whats fiction. using video games is just a lousy pathetic excuse for those stupid congressmen on the fox news to use against it."
24644,"I hate it when number 1 happens, FOR FUCK SAKE NEWS MEDIA SHUT UP! Thank you."
24645,This stupid
24646,"Games are less violent then real life, just think about it that society kills faster to it's own people than a game. You get responds and try again, life doesn't give you that choice- news and politics media needs to cool there tits."
24647,"I absolutely love how none of the outspoken news channels and politicians actually thought any of the games were offensive. They only spoke against them for publicity and rating for news, and to look like a hero and get votes for politicians. And the people that actually believe any of it truly are the reason why my dear America is becoming populating which idiots and their disease known as stupidis dumbassis."
24648,"#3 is the reason why I kind of ignore CoD, not because of the violence but because I sold quite a few copies to parents buying it for the under aged kids. I see it as polygons killing polygons but I wouldn't expect most kids to see that or understand the story."
24649,Fox News can BURN IN HELL!
24650,The mw2 was a little unsettling
24651,people blame games for the horror of some people action just because they played a violence game without remembering that a sane person would and could differentiate between life and a game. just because i play a lot of violent games ( all my games are M rated) mean that i will go on killing spree in public places.
24652,I remember that mission in MW2.. It was pretty brutal.
24653,So much Fox.
24654,Just a game people...
24655,BUT what we dont care its a fucking game wtf
24656,"I guess all these ""experts"" in the Government believe that real, perpetual warfare and violence is safer for our society than the virtual version.
Also every single one of these ""holy"" people have had sex in real life, but some how it's not ok to do in a virtual world.
If they don't like these games they don't have to play them. If they want to tell other people how they should spend their time, they can go fuck themselves."
24657,Does anyone else find it unusual that when they put sex in video games everybody in the media flips out as if sex is a big crime or something?
24658,5:27 eegeeegbee
24659,What? a video game has a sex scene in it? How dare they put something in a video game that has been in movies for decades!
24660,"Fuck Jack Thompson, it's fun to murder you."
24661,"ok that thing about ""People having fun with war games even though they are offensive to the U.S. Army or whatever the heck"" yeah....THAT IS CRAP!!!!! They must have seen Call of Duty games and they are 100% directed to war and they are freakin' famous, and another thing......THEY ARE STILL MAKING MORE!!!! I guess 1 game about a actual war is WORSE than 21 games about FAKE war. Fake or not it is still war so I say the congress were tripping on acid or something.(btw I am not trying to say they should stop making CoD games I freaking love them.)"
24662,"I really hate the press for hating on Six Days in Fallujah. That game sounds like it's telling history, not bullshit national superpower wars."
24663,Yeah... only the conservative media.
24664,only old people who never played video games think it makes us want to kill people
24665,Well I saw number 3 coming a mile away.
24666,"aduls be like these video games are destroying our kids
well who are the fucking retarded people buying GTA 5 For there 10 year old"
24667,"i agree that some games are too violent for little kids, but thats what ratings are for."
24668,"Australian government is so fucking stupid, our economy is going to fuck and it's ran by retards -_-"
24669,you'll notice that fox news are the idiots fueling almost every single one
24670,"The thing about gambling in Pokemon, or most games for that sake, is that it's incredibly hard and time consuming to actually make a profit. In the games the currency is practically unlimited so when they encounter real gambling with real money at stake, they already know the risk greatly outweighs the reward."
24671,/when i was 10 i tried making the deadrising 1 franks zombie slugger dont ask me how it went
24672,iff i didnt ever meet with video games i be a profesional bascket ball player with a scholarship
24673,now i feel bad becuase of all those marines that lost their lifes and im just sitting around like a fat pig playng war games and laughing when i die
24674,"lol i like how this video tries to pin video game blaming solely on conservatives. and a lot of the media personalities he shows shutting down games and stifling shit are liberals
next time do yourself and your credibility a favor and just say news media instead of conservative or liberal cuz they both do it to the same degree. liberal media more so because there is simply more networks of that bent and a slow news day being what it is.... well you get the picture.
for the record Im a conservative and i found most of the controversial games to be quite entertaining.
i considered no russian to simply be good story telling you didnt even have to really pull the trigger the henchemen you were with would kill all the innocents for you if you were inclined to not shoot them and it added to the story.
i can say iv seen worse shit in movies then what was in no russian or GTA but ofc hollywood is a liberal institution for the most part and is above slander besides the more controversial a movie the more likely it gets an award.
while many conservatives will not play some of these games on religious principle. more still will play them with the common sense realization that its just a game.
and id have to wonder how many violent situations have been avoided in the world cuz the guy who would have committed them blew his stress off at home pwning 8yr olds at their own game."
24675,But thats gay that te media is trying to stopthese games they can just go
24676,This is so true i play these games but it is getting out of hand with the killing like people are going on masscares in real life and i have played the modern warfare 2 airport mass killing one of the worst things i have ever done
24677,i think its bs that people blame stuff on MW2 it says it is graphical and u can skip it
24678,"What about ""ShadowMan"" for the N64 ... ?"
24679,"""Women in Mass Effect aren't seen as anything other than sex objects""
AHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHA"
24680,Before watching: I predict Postal will be on here somewhere.
24681,"this same shit is in movies.
i almost rarely people cappin' on those."
24682,"Alright, here is something. Video games are not to blame on real world violence. As a matter of fact, video games get that from real world events. Now, some people have a mental illness that causes them to go out and actually do something, but thats because they don't know when a video game ends and real life starts. Before I ramble, I just want to say that the game should not be hammered, but how some people interpret that game, and if they know the difference between life and a game. There is a lot more, but I feel this needed to be stated."
24683,"I hope the people know that a kid who plays video games isn't gonna go ""OH WOW! THIS IS SO FUN KILLING PEOPLE!"" and go kill someone. You only do that when your just really messed up in the head. Kinda like how on one of the school shootings it says he shot up a school AFTER playing Call of Duty. They make it seem like he shot up a school because he liked playing violent video games. Just wow media."
24684,"all these dumb people ahh my brain hurts, really. And hunters kill animals because they.played gta 5 ..."
24685,I love how in most of these clips its always some shithead brainless retard from Fox News talking about video games
24686,that's just a game stop rage bitches
24687,Fucking shit
24688,WTF!? people will crab about any thing it's just a game. the only thing a game does is entertain.
24689,a child is only a reflection of their parents.
24690,"I've played almost every version of Pokemon, and I have NEVER, (I repeat, NEVER) seen them depict anywhere how to perform satanic rituals or cast spells!"
24691,I like how he instantly knewthat everyone ofthese pissed everyone off lols.
24692,hot coffee?! whatever most people didnt even wanna go through the hassle. first you had to have the pc version. then you had to find the mod which was pretty hard. then you had to sift through the directions to figure out how to install it. then you had to play through the game up until that point and when all the dust was settled it was crappy and they had clothes on anyway. Chances are if they were smart enough to manage to get through all those steps to play this crappy mini game there most likely nothing stopping them from watching actual porn :P
24693,"all of these annoy me, especially the mass effect one. Saying that the game is about having sex, not at all! It's about huge sentient machines wiping out the galaxy. There's a slight difference"
24694,"The woman at 5:20 is such a bitch! She wouldn't even let him talk. ""Obviously you knew you might get some blowback because some people lost their children."" People lost their children in every war you moron"
24695,"I love how it's always Fox News that has issues with war in video games. A republican news network being against anything that has to do with war? Amazing. AND that one game that reenacted a real battle, there are video games that include real battle from different war eras. People lost their children in those battles too but nobody seems to care for whatever reason. Mysterious."
24696,by playing shooting how can u learn to shoot if you can't load a gun in real life i under stand man hunt 2 for wii but the one that pissed me of that in 1999 the columbine shooting people thought that the 2 people practice the game doom to train for the shooting and the game columbine massicare rpg caused the college shooting i dont know where i forgot by looking at the game columbine massicare rpg u see u choose to kill the people its like pokemon but there is guns no animals ya u know
24697,"What's the difference between imagining it (shown to be common and therapeutic) and virtually acting it out? How about the real cause...mental illness. Let's address that elephant. Oh, but we can't, because it's far more dangerous to label something than to just ignore it. Sorry, but before we can change something, we have to admit it needs changing. The world is moving so fast now, and there are so many people neglected or deprived of social support and other resources. There will always be the people who look into new ways to make their careers based on BS data. We started off needing each other and in cultures and tribes where all work (hunting and gathering) was redistributed equally among the peoples. Now, people are taught to ""take care of number one (the self)"". We are far too dependent and connected to successfully carry on with this ignorant and self-serving trend. You don't have to go out of your way to help someone, but don't go out of your way to hinder someone's achieving their success/health just to be politically correct or to refrain from ""insulting"" them. That's the true insult, ignoring that the fuse has been lit and it's just a matter of time before an explosion."
24698,woo...my favorite topic...politicians flippin out.
24699,pokemon is demonic lol
24700,You guys should do the top 10benefitsof video games
24701,"Wow clap clap Media -.-
You know most of this stuff you mentioned happened in the movies too? But why dont you talk about them too?!?
Video-Games make fun of adoption well South Park makes fun of gingers but there never was such a big deal about it
Why?
Because South Park is a show
And in Mass Effect its part of the game to choose the girl you wanna be whit .-."
24702,"You should've seen the Half-Life 2 Mod, What was it called. ""North American School Shooter 2012""?"
24703,"Its clear to everyone that video games which you kill is always going to be something the media and parents alike will gladly use as a scapegoat... And i know some people will disagree with me here, but Video games hold no blame to these shootings, nor to the violence in the world.
You can tell me all you wish, and it will be your own opinion, and i will accept you believe i am wrong, you are welcome to believe i am wrong here, but do not tell me i am wrong and should agree to your way of thinking, as this is my opinion....
First off, Video games only existed recently. many forget that this is 2014, and games came to be in the 50's thats only 64 years, our current grandparent generation would remember when games first made public view. We can trace human kind and our current evolved state back to 10,000BC. That's 12,014 YEARS of human expansion. Were we docile herbivores back then who liked butterflies and sitting round campfires singing kombaiya? No.
We were out killing animals for food, and beating eachother with clubs for kicks. Let's not forget the romans throwing humans into a pit and watching them fight to the death for fun, and what about the crusades? genecide of a people over land? What video games were they playing to think of such ideas? When pirates went to pillage plunder and do all those things to innocent people, what kind of handheld did they have to be thinking booze and blowing stuff up with a cannon was fun? i doubt al capone made his entire organization stop running for ten hours every day just to play video games to make them more violent.
Video games are a scapegoat. The reason people blame them is because they are an easy target. The real reason kids grow up angry, the real reason for these shootings is not video games. The video games that are attacked are mainly rated M for mature, and last i checked any distributor of video games, gamestop blockbuster or any video store, is REQUIRED to ask for ID to be 17/18 or older to buy a game or rent a game, meaning a kid has no access to GTA or MK. they cannot get those games on their own, the parents have to buy it for them. the PARENTS buy their kids a game that is CLEARLY marked M for mature, with warning on why it is M for mature, be it sexual content graphic content or others.
so even IF the video games make these kids turn violent, IF, and its a big if, the reason they even HAVE the game is careless parents not caring. And how the heck are these kids getting guns? you need a license to buy a gun, that takes time, and being of legal age. If a 7 year old has access to a gun, then it means the parents CARELESSLY left a gun within their reach. the parents put it on a low surface without a care in the world, and got their kids a video game clearly marked for older audiences, and they are not blamed for any of this?
Even if Video games were to blame for increased violent behavior, the facts do not fit that they are the only things to blame. Parents buy the games, parents leave guns within reach, careless parenting has been the reason bullies are made in school and it is the reason there are all these news reports.
Agree or disagree. these are the facts i found that make me believe what i do about this whole controversy. it is still my opinion regardless, and am just throwing it out there. tear me apart, agree totally, or anything in between. your opinion is yours, mine is mine."
24704,"I hate censorship in games. The PAL version of Last Of Us is significantly different from the NTSC version; there's a lot less gore, no guts or decapitations. It's a game FFS.
Only a complete moron would think that kids are going to go on a killing spree in real life after what they saw in a game."
24705,Anita Sarkesian is a controversy all on her own.
24706,i fucking hate media
24707,Why is Falluja a controversy while their own military develops war games? (America's Army)
24708,"News people, we're not mindless idiots. We're not going to play Call of Duty, then say ""Hey, wouldn't it be fun to do this in real life?"" Anyone who believes video games are the cause for violence is retarded."
24709,"Video games aren't what give people ideas to commit mass shootings, or something of the sort. Any person who would even THINK about shooting up a school or mall obviously already would have serious mental problems from the beginning. That's my theory."
24710,what about the Haitian issue in Vice City?
24711,lady at the end = smart
24712,"this is stupid, just like guns, videogames dont kill people, people kill people."
24713,"There hasn't been a Mortal Kombat Killer...I said it in 1993 in the 7th grade, I'm still saying it now.  I blame the parents and their inability to raise their kids right and discipline them."
24714,"ESRB, there are people today that still don't know about it, call of duty for a 13 years old kids, crazy"
24715,Stupid ass news reporters
24716,people need to get the sand out of their vagina's and pick up a controller
24717,"the way i see it, is that all those who say that the games are this and that is because they dont understand that its just games... it will never be more than that and the reson why they dont get that is cuz they probably dont play videogames at all... not like we gonna do like peter griffin, play gta for 8 hours and then go out in the street and do whatever we do in gta... and these bad criticts about that kind of games are pointless and dumb..."
24718,"The rating for games like manhunt, gta and mass effect are all their right so why are people so shocked. The esrb system is there for a reason. Also if people do not want kids playing graphic games then the parents should do something. Videos game are an art form then should not be banned or censored if a few people think they are bad."
24719,"I play video games like 5 hours a day...i have been playing like over 10 years now.
I kill humans and animals INGAME.
I have never even had a fight in real life.
Hitler never played video games.
So blaming video games for real violence? trols..."
24720,Three things these news channels need to do 1. Do their research 2. Play the game in question 3. Shut the fuck up.
24721,Who is that sexy newscaster at 6:44 ?
24722,You don't know how much we Australian's suffer. I JUST WANT TO PLAY ALL THE GAMES
24723,fox news would say that bullshit about as affect
24724,I've spent the last about six years trying to remember Night Trap's name and I gave up a long time ago then I stumble onto this video. xD
24725,Im happy to learn that some people are deciding to look at the big picture.
24726,"If I remember correct at least in Mass Effect 1 and 2 (haven't played 3), you can pick a female Shepard and do some (alien) guys. And seriously - marking Pokemon as a source of animal abuse and witchcraft is rediculious."
24727,Everyone knows that anyone who hates video games has never tried one!
24728,"I love how most Americans are retarded enough to blame games for killings etc, but not smart enough to realize that maybe just maybe if there were less FUCKING GUNS at every corner shit wouldn't happen as much. No offense to the reasonable Americans."
24729,"I'm sorry, but Manhunt was just a fucked up game."
24730,"This entire subject of video game controversy is pretty alien in my country (Denmark). This is a country that has only ever banned 1 game: EA Sports MMA for the sole reason that commercials for energy drinks isn't allowed here! That said, no matter how violent, graphic, sexual or offensive a game is, it's protected by the freedom to express your art. So we have access to the same, or even more offensive games then anyone, but i can't recall a single case where videogames have ever been brought up in the news! And no cases of them being linked to violent events have ever been made! It astounds me to this day that some people can't make the connection, that people do these horrible acts of violence because of mental issues, and not because of the games! If you can go out and shoot 20 people, there were something seriously wrong with you BEFORE you started playing videogames..."
24731,"Do your research Watchmojo (I know, how useless of a statement) Australia had all those games you listed, they were just altered."
24732,This should be top 15 or 20 instead
24733,3:42 is that YOGSCAST Kim? Because i knew she used to be a reporter.
24734,"I hate people who blame stuff like guns or video games for killings.  Face it, some people are fucking crazy. If they want to kill a bunch of kids ina school they are gonna do it with or without video games or guns"
24735,omg @ 02:50 it's sylar lol
24736,How was Doom not explicitly listed? Every news report about video game violence throughout the 90's and beyond has had clips from Doom.
24737,3:46 KIM FROM YOGSCAST
24738,The controversy is true and just because you can differ reality from fantasy doesn't mean everyone can so dont be so foolish
24739,"Mass killings were around long before guns. Guns, nor video games, are the problem. It's metal illness, in my opinion. I think we can all agree that anyone who is willing and capable of doing such awful things is mentally unstable."
24740,"people who are actually mimicking violent video games are either
A - stupid
or
B - really fucking stupid
since you never here ""little boy shoots friend screaming BOOM HEAD SHOT!"""
24741,Postal is more violent then any here xD
24742,"OH MY GOD. I hate news anchors and anyone for that matter that blame mass shootings or any form of violence on video games. What did serial killers do before we even had televisions. Everyone just uses video games as an excuse for it all because if that don't blame it on something, then they don't have a story for the news, I have a word for it, LAZY AND STUPID."
24743,"So about the whole ""six days in Fallujah"" thing, why is it that someone decided to say ""Oh hey don't make a video game of that, my son died in that battle"" which is a terrible thing to happen, it really is; but hasn't anyone considered to ask about making games from other wars? I don't mean just showing Americans being killed is bad (because that'd be a really ignorant thing to say) but why hasn't anyone asked about all the people you end up shooting at in games? They're still someone's kid too. But y'know, never mind other people who've suffered through the death of their child too. I don't understand people..."
24744,Oh my god! So because I play mine craft then I am gonna buy a diamond sword and go on a stabbing spree!
24745,I wondered if the Florida lawyer who-shall-not-be-named would show up. Very classy to erase his name. And fitting.
24746,Only people of our generation understand video games. Everyone else has no clue because they weren't invented yet.
24747,"i hate when the news blames video games for violence. i use games such as gta call of duty, battlefield to vent anger and stress. i have played at least 200 violent games in my life and i have never even had the thought of killing someone in real life even though i find it fun to kill in video games."
24748,"Anyone who thinks that FPS video games affect people's behavior is, and I say this in the nicest possible way, a 1st CLASS RETARD. and don't even get me started on the fact that they have nothing better to do with their time then yell at plastic gaming disks for ""curuption""."
24749,"I have alot of fun with games like GTA5 Mortal Kombat and man hunt, and im usually really calm and suttee and try not to bash jerkish peoples heads into the desk to often."
24750,"I love how this video specifically targets conservative news when in all reality it's also liberal news stations that cover these kinds of controversies, too. Smh. I've watched Fox on covering mass shootings and video games and there are people on there that actually defend video games saying that there is no link between the violence in video games and mass shootings. Whereas, in the liberal news media, they cover that violent video games should be banned or censored. I'm a little disappointed that WatchMojo didn't cover a ""all-inclusive"" media outlet."
24751,"it just comes to show ya, people will find any way to ruin your fun. Remember the Backlash World of Warcraft gotten during its first 2 years?"
24752,Pokemon is satanic? what kind of retards are those people?
24753,"If there is one thing i hate, it is religious cooks >_< witchcraft. please -_-
and also feminists... i love woman but..feminists.. just STFU >_< XDDDD"
24754,???: hey bro video games are bad... they are creating killers. Me: hey you see this controler ? STICK THAT UP YOUR ASS AND SHUT UP
24755,"i think MW2 would have sucked without the no Russian mission it shows to sometimes be a hero, you must do things you don't want to. it doesn't glorify soldiers has perfect people, I was a reporter in Iraq, once i saw a soldier shoot a child a suicide bomber. Too have to commit terrible acts like that and be treated like a pefect angel must feel awful"
24756,games are for entertainment :| and killing people on games is entertaining ... for me anyways :3
24757,"I wish they know that gta,Pokemon or call of duty that it is FAKE because video game are not to blame there just crazy people out there."
24758,"I LOVE POKEMON,MORTAL KOMBAT also all games are banned in Austraila"
24759,"people kill people, not video games if anything a gamer is less likely to kill"
24760,mw3
24761,Gta is awesome and fan so f#ck you controversies.
24762,"i dont think games like that influences violent behavior, if that happens that person has something wrong in their brains"
24763,if video games can cause actuel violence then im all for it.
24764,Omg i used C4 in BF3 someone on the news gonna flip out about that?! WTF?! I play games all the time minecraft and zombies are going to make me do this?! BULL FUCKING SHIT
24765,"wow, that last bit about the mental illness got me.
I play violent video games AND have been diagnosed as mentally ill.
so according to that lady im gonna go and killa whole bunch of people?
yeah. bullshit.
you wanna know the scaryest game in the world?
it's called 'life'"
24766,"This is normal,if the game developers take all money,for our entertainment and making our life happier,then what will government steel?!
That is because they start shutting down people,that actually do something not only sitting and stealing..."
24767,manhunt was great
24768,"they dont just blame video games they blame everything from music to movies and then some. if a person thinks that it would be a good idea to mimic something violent in any of them then they aren't right in the head. now their argument is "" since we cant control whether a person with a known or unknown mental illness gets these violent examples then get rid of them all together."" thats understandable, but just as impossible. i guess scientific evidence still has the same standing as it did when people were burned at the stake for being able to swim"
24769,Video games = violence is bullshit. There have been mass shootings ever since guns were invented. Wanna blame the games for those too?
24770,I sense a cowboy bebop at his computer.
24771,"What about the ""No Russian"" mission from Modern Warfare 2?"
24772,Just because I see Scorpion rip off some guy's head it doesn't mean that I'm gonna go around ripping off heads.
24773,05:27 what a colossal bitch.
24774,"I remember there was a PS game called Thrill Kill that was cancelled due to it's extreme violence and obscenity such as gratuitous dismemberment, gore, nudity, and acts such as pissing on corpses. I remember reading the controversy over it in nearly every major gaming magazine there was. It was a big deal back then, so it's kind of strange that they didn't even mention it."
24775,"I like Fox News, and I watch it on a semi regular basis. But DAMN do they piss me off at this crap."
24776,miss one thing.. might have been just big over here but when resident evil 5 came out (or about to) it was concidered rasist against the black
24777,"C'mon, that Russian mission was fun."
24778,"What I just don't get is why do parents buy games for their 5 year old children, who have no concept of right and wrong, then wonder why they grow to enjoy violence? And how comes these news story neglect to mention that almost every single mass shooter has some kind of mental disorder?"
24779,what about TOTAL CARAGE!!
24780,These conservative freaks piss me off so much. I wonder if they realize how stupid what they're saying is or if they're really that delusional...
24781,Game at 8:30?
24782,Where is postal 2 ???
24783,"they completly miss the points that this can influence good hand to eye co-ordination, ability to think outside the box, ability to work as a team. There's is so many GOOD points to video games. People who cant/don't play them are the ones who QQ. A shame really, they'd probably enjoy letting some of that frustration out by mauling some people on GTA xD"
24784,"I'm still mad that people said that kids under 13 can't play minecraft because it's to violent (I'm 13, I'm not a complaining spoiled 10 year old). HELLO?!?! 10 YEAR OLDS PLAY GTA 5 AND 1st PERSON SHOOTERS!!!!!!"
24785,"ignorant... well, i think that pretty much sums it up"
24786,"unfortunately i would agree about manhunt, cus its just sadism, with no overarching goal"
24787,"not sure if I should laugh at the stupidity or the fact that they're saying pokemon isSATANIC,and furthermore its so annoying that when children commit crime and they hear that they play games they just label games as the cause WTF!. they need tolook deeper into the childs history as well as the parents historyand then they might find something that'smoreplausible"
24788,"Weapons do not kill people, it's the people who wield such weapons that kills."
24789,AT THE END OF THE DAY IM THE REAL WINNER BECAUSE I GOT THE GTA SAN ANDREAS!!!!!!!
24790,Reckless to say that these violent video games influence the mass shooters' subhuman actions? I say it's pretty obvious there's a link--to say a link doesn't exist is to deny reality. Every one of these shooters has been linked to violent video game playing!
24791,"2:25 ....game #8,Is that the girl from Different Strokes!? I bet it is... I forget her name though"
24792,if it is true that video games make people violent (and i'm not saying it is) what video game have mankind and indeed most living creatures been playing since they were first noted on earth
24793,"6 days in Fallujah funding pulled... Tragic! It'd be OK via film, TV, novel... Ignorant people see the word ""game"" and freak out. It's a legitimate medium to convey a story."
24794,"This just reminded me how my mom told me that if I keep playing video games, then I won't be able to tell the difference from real-life and a video game. I wasn't able to face palm hard enough..."
24795,"I've played a shit ton of video games in my life, and I have played the MW2 airport mission many times and had fun doing so, but I have not gone out and killed a bunch of people in a mass shooting. Video games are not at fault for those horrific shootings, the people who commit the crime have something major wrong with them, it's not the game's fault."
24796,I live in Australia and seen both those games on store shelves millions of times
24797,MURRICAA (and for once: OZZIES)
24798,"A Carmageddon shout-out, hell yeah"
24799,"and in the end, she was right. everyone goes: ""oh! the fucking [insert a game's name here] is the culprit for all delinquency & violence"", ""the stupid anime is the cause why all the children are turning satanists"", ""teenagers go bat-shit-crazy because of what the tv shows today""; instead of being realistic and say: ""everybody please calm down & think of something to blame our bad parenting to, but let's be really careful no one notes that, who said we can't be good parents even though we're a bunch of good-for-nothing, unemployed or sub-employed douches or(unintended... yeah, right!) teen-parents!?"""
24800,It makes sense for people on TV to try and destory the image of videogames. Videogames are a competing medium that drives audiences away from TV (you're not watching TV when you're playing). It makes perfect sense that they wouldn't like videogames.
24801,I've always hated manhunt smh
24802,"i hate how people blame video games for things like violence but ""artists"" like drake do drugs and post about it and miley who basicly tells children be sluty games are for fun in my opion its for venting its a game you have to understand that when im so pissed I just go home and play grand theft auto murder a few people and feel better"
24803,"considering human history and human instinct killing, murdering and war havehappened before computer games ever came to light"
24804,Yogscast shoutout!!!
24805,"In the end of the day, it's just a damn game."
24806,"It is not the games fault people are killing it's the stupid ass kids these days thinking they have ""swag"" or they're ""gangster"" by shooting people. It's not funny, sorry to tell you."
24807,I think that it is really stupid how people think that its the video games that are making people do shootings... i ALWAYS wanted to go and shoot assholes before i play call of duty or battlefield... i mean come on. The people that go do the shootings are messed up in the head before they play... its the parents fault... If i thought that my child might ACTUALLY go and shoot someone i would 1
24808,"What really confuses me, is how virtual female breasts are worth censorship, but graphic, virtual murder is not. This applies in all forms of entertainment."
24809,"Very good list. I knew MK would be on there somewhere. That was cool to see footage from the highly unappreciated Madworld at the end of the video.
There are some very crazy controversies surrounding video games. That Pokemon one was pretty crazy, but I had a feeling animal abuse would be mentioned there."
24810,"The ""no russians"" one is the only one that seems inappropriate"
24811,"Pokemon don`t cast spells... They just use their abilities that they were born with to battle other Pokemon,and PETA can`t say it promotes animal abuse,because they are fictional animals,and they don`t die,they just faint..."
24812,"Ppl blaming Games on mass shootings is so fucking stupid. They had the ESRB ratings for like what? 20000 years ago? Like really they made that so ppl could tell if a game is inappropriate or not and to stop ppl from bitching on a game. The Pokemon one is so retarded. So if ppl fight,wrestle,box, sports it's not abusive? But if two animals fight it is? So if I hit a punching bag with a baseball bat it's object abuse?And that's a dumb topic cuz ppl EAT animals and fish. Anyways if you kill ppl cuz of games you're a moron. If your child kills ppl cuz you BUYED them a game that was TOO violent it's your fault. And stop with GTA. That game has a M Rated ESBR rating and the game is called GRAND THEFT AUTO FIVE. Don't just buy a game without knowing what the game is. You look at the rating, know the game, know the risks, and READ THE TITLE OF THE GAME. Really stop with this shit."
24813,"Regardless if I agree with your views or not, if you skew the subject to fit your opinion then your credibility is outta here."
24814,"Number 4 is a perfect example of stupidity and cowardice in the face of truth, those Marines who were a part of the project were trying to tell the real story, rather than some reporter's pointless babbling over clips taken out of context."
24815,"I hate how in movies they can show almost anything like in the saw movies but then
stuff much milder like saints row gets a flat out ban its not even that bad im like really it seems there's different rules for different forms of entertainment how can developers innovate while they are censored so bad. on another note not even a mention for the first manhunt?"
24816,"Violent video games cause people to go out and gun down unsuspecting crowds? Biggest pile shit I ever heard.
Take Charles Whitman for example. He didn't even have an option to play violent video games (none had even been invented yet) but he still killed his wife and mother before he climbed up a bell tower and shot a ton of people only to later be gunned down by authorities himself.
He's proof enough that violent video games especially shooters aren't what makes people grab a gun or two and go out and start shooting into crowds."
24817,"Gotta love people with nothing better to do then bitch about things that they are too uneducated to even understand. I mean seriously now its the 21st century we cant censor the world. What is the difference between animated blood in games and theatrical blood in movies? Movie blood is more realistic. You ever consider the fact that kids who shoot schools and other public places have a different issue? Bullying, shitty parents who beat their kids, or neglect? maybe the world should be more concentrated on how we treat each other rather then jumping to conclusions to save your own ass."
24818,All of them pissed me off
24819,Course fox news is the one complaining.
24820,What's wrong satanic stuff? U don't hear satanists going around calling things wrong cause they are Christian!!! Wtf maybe it is satanist if u don't like it don't play it and worry bout urself dumb bitch and I'm not talkin bout the guy that made this video don't get me wrong I'm talking bout the fucking media!
24821,i want that saints row room
24822,the government should keep in mind that GTA 5 made a billion in 3 days. not bad for the economy
24823,"I wont lie, the no russian mission sickened me."
24824,"I think video game controversies are stupid, if anything, these games make you less violent by letting you take your anger out on people in the games. But in games like Mario I seem to find myself punching a lot of stuff IRL"
24825,"Man, politicians are bitches."
24826,"Ug, just ug. I hate the news. And the, to be blatant, story whores that work for it."
24827,5:28 was that the guys voice making that noise?! What the fuck is that noise loll
24828,GUNS DONT KILL PEOPLE PEOPLE KILL PLEOPLE
24829,So much bullshit...
24830,"Those poor ""Battle of Fallejuh"" developer's, they were going to show a moment of history, through the eyes of the soldiers. It would've had you seen the battle a different way, experience it somewhat to how they did. People over-react too much.
Fuck that FOX news reporter."
24831,"Fox News, everybody. Always goes for the easy targets that their audience, old people, won't understand and will readily demonize."
24832,You have to admit the no Russian level was fun AF
24833,"What frustrates me the most is that the media never looks at other forms of entertainment. So many movies and tv series these days show horrific violence, which can now be accessed 24/7 thanks to the internet and tv recorders. As well as this, you have the constant news stream of death and despair, not to mention the fact that music, in particular forms such as rap and hip-hop, sometimes promote extreme violence. For example, remember Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines (I know you want it)? That song is immensely popular, and it's entirely based on the supposed blurred lines between consensual sex and rape! Death, violence and brutality are so heavily ingrained in our culture these days that it really has become difficult to avoid it, and to blame any particular area of entertainment would be ignorant."
24834,"U.S government, Republicans and P.E.T.A. The holy trinity of bitching and whining"
24835,5:17 bitch! Imma smack a ho!
24836,i dont care what other ppl think about video games they are just fun to play
24837,omg screw the government hating games!!
24838,"Oh we all know what's wrong with the world today... but no one wants to go and blame government officials, corrupt politicians, and other people who put money in their pocket... So let's blame video games!
The news media is whats fucking wrong with the world today if you ask me...."
24839,Most realistic sex acts ever conceived??????? jjeez im so sorry for that guy's wife...
24840,the press are filled with idiots
24841,"You what gets me: That PETA has the nerve to put Pokemon on blast, but says nothing, and I mean nothing about Monster Hunter."
24842,I really hate people these days lol
24843,We dont know why he killed 10 people so lets just blame it on video games.
24844,NEWS ITS A FUCKING GANE
24845,why play video games and kill people when the US govt pays you to in real life?
24846,"real, sane conservatives: Americas problems are caused by (insert legit reasons here)
Fox news: VIDEO GAMES AND HOMOSEXUALITY WILL BE THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!!!!!"
24847,wow. #3 is disgusting.
24848,ABACABB
24849,Busted a gut laughing at the Pokemon one.
24850,im sorry but iv been playing the total war series of games since they were released...yet i have no urge to gather an army and wipe out every other nation
24851,"No one talked about the level in Postal in which your objective is to go to an elementary school and kill all the children on the playground, but they put coverage on a war game portraying fake war (as if it were the first war game ever created), as opposed to actual war scenes and other violence constantly plastered on the news(...uh) and every other form of media as unacceptable?
Does not compute.
Also worth mentioning about Australia: They gave Atelier Totori (the Vita version) an R18+ rating for ""references to sexual violence"", and after playing through the game twice and unlocking almost every scene, I'm still wondering which one includes that. It was rated T in the USA for both versions."
24852,games do have warnings silly media (sarcasm aint it)
24853,I wonder when we get to play as a kid who walks into a school shooting classmates and teachers. Maybe I'll ask for that for Christmas next year.
24854,Since when was Pokmon ever Satanic
24855,I'm still lost on how Pokemon is Satanic...
24856,"After the columbine shooting the news reported that the shooters had modded doom and built a level based on the school. theres only one problem with that they never planned on entering the school so why make the level
people take a hint you cant just blame video games because you shoot people in them"
24857,Battle of Fallujah sounds a lot like the Black Hawk Down game from mid 2000...
24858,"I get some games can go over the edge, like say man hunt but you telling me something which is not real can spur so much negativity.
But what I find fucking amusing is all those yanks crying about the violence and quite right so in some cases, hand their child a fucking bible, which as more horrendous deaths, child killings in and out of the womb and that's ok!"
24859,"To the fox news guy, The bible needs a warning becauseit can be addictive and psychologically damaging just look at your news readers ;)"
24860,"I must admit, i understand how parents find games like Call Of Duty and GTA inappropriate especially for their children to play, but they keep saying ""video games are bad"" and ""Let's ban all video games"", not all video games that are good have violence, hell, most of my favorites have none! Look at Journey, The Stanley Parable, LittleBigPlanet, SimCity, Portal and Kerbal Space Program. All of these game promote either creativity or discovery, but they have no (to minimal) violence. Many games also have very strategic focused gameplay. Minecraft is also a good example of this, it promotes discovery, math, creativity, focus, memory and much more!
And people say video games do no good to the world, but there is a youtuber called ""Athene"" that has raised over 10 million dollars for starving children, through VIDEO GAMES."
24861,notice how f*cking fox f*cks over these videogames and claim false statements. God I hate fox news
24862,you forgot adding Portal 2 thats an awesome violent game hahaha you can pee on people
24863,"Everyone to Balkan,no banned games at all lol"

24869,think the whole racist shitstorm about resident evil V should have been in here... that was just hilarious.
24870,"Wheatley points out that adoption means lack of parents. Well, what the hell else does it mean?! Over sensitive morons."
24871,I think some people are stupid to copy games they give games bad credit for stupid acts which end up pulling themfrom stores they don't have the mentality to think its not real
24872,i think all games must be seen by her or his parent not any games good to children or teenages :)
24873,"If you're going to go on a murderous rampage with what you learned in video games, don't shoot people. Been there done that. I'd pull a kerbal space program and crash a giant rocket into the moon."
24874,"4:43
people are fucking ridiculous. a video game is a form of media just like a movie or television show. for a company to make a video game based on a real event is no more rude/insulting than if a documentary were made of said same event."
24875,What i dont't understand is if you do not like said video games in the video. Then why do you play them and its the parents choice to let their kids play violent games
24876,"Whenever a shooting occurs , video games especially GTA are always to blame"
24877,1:43 Miss POPO
24878,How is Gears of War not in this video?
24879,"I reckon, you're looking at 0.0001% of gamers who lose it and go on a mass killing spree. And obviously it isn't because they're gamers, they also have influence from film, music, TV, etc.
So, what I'm saying is: ""I accept your premise, I reject your conclusion.""
Now excuse me while I go play Sims 3. If I am to lose my shit and keep redecorating my house afterwards, will someone please contact the media and call for an end to this atrocity."
24880,Pokemon being witchcraft? get real 1:32
24881,The fact is that the floating devil that you say was a bird in 1985 was a real thing. The fact is that you stole the relics of it all including my inheritance is the biggest problem ever. The fact that you thief the lottery money and say its a carpet is the biggest problem and the fact that the moon stays on my side of the earth and the spontaneous beams of light above my house is the biggest problem! The fact that I will continue to think harshly about all of you because you do not try to remend any of the issues besides employing violence is where my harsh reaches beyond the limits and brings in the biggest problems you all can ever know upon this earth!
24882,Yay! Pokemon and Mass Effect :D
24883,People are way to damn sensitive now a days or they just blame the media instead of taking responsibility because you're the one who lets the watch or play these things
24884,Guns don't kill people video games do.
24885,"Just so you know, you're not helping the case by swearing, ranting and blatantly insulting the other side. Just because they're wrong doesn't mean you have to attack them. You'll never convince anyone video games don't make you violent if you're screaming like a madman. Lay down your arguments and present your facts like a proper human being."
24886,That girl at the end is right there is something wrong with their mind
24887,"I'm sick of stuff like that. One you were little and there was a scary part in a movie your parents probably told you that it was not real its the same for video games!!! Video games are not real. Have you ever seen Chucky. That's about a vodo toy slitting peoples throats but that's fine but shooting a person in a video game is just horrifying. When that woman said my son didn't have that chance about that war game I laughed. People's children died in WW2 so we have to destroy all copies of Saving Private Ryan. If you go around shooting people you are mentally unstable!!!!!!!!!! I hate that they think that these games are ment for kids and only kids play video games. A few months a go I saw a story about a 96 year old lady that had been playing video games for 40 years. They showed video her playing GTA4,and mafia 2. And also there's an ESRB rating on all games look on the back of the box and open your ducking eyes guess what there's a rating. This is completely stupid."
24888,"That ""No Russian"" mission was not enjoyable in some sick way for me at all. The anchor made it sound like that was the point of it. I think it did a good job of getting the horror across. 24-hour news channels are the worst. They cover the dumbest shit because they need to fill time and get ratings. They don't have any knowledge or experience in most of what they're ""reporting."" You'd think we were living in a peaceful and prosperous time, so much so that we could talk about non-issues all day on TV."
24889,"pokemon usecontroversy magnet, wild peta used insane f^(&ing game. its supereffective. pokemons reputation was bashed"
24890,the lady at the vary end is the only smart one out there
24891,"You know, if the media were right about video games making people violent, I, and about 70% of the world population, would be blood-thirsty, trigger-happy, raving murderers. If every person I ever killed in a video game counted as murder, I would've gotten the death penalty a LONG time ago."
24892,"I don't get that Fox News guy. He thinks Video Games are sick and potentially psychologically damaging. I'm sorry, but how many SAW films are there now? Or TV shows about crime and murder? Books that describe in detail things that are too graphic even for a film?
Games are just one more form of entertainment. For every game that involves something like that (GTA)there are many more that do not (Kingdom Hearts, Soul Calibur, Ratchet & Clank, Monster Hunter, etc.).Get over it."
24893,3:42 OMFG ITS KIM EVERYONE ITS KIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
24894,Video games are supposed to be violent. If you do not like that do not play it.
24895,"That's the problem with the media in this damn country: They will outright REFUSE ANY scientific study if it doesn't match their political agenda like global warming is a myth, video games make terrorists not the fact our redneck state you can buy an assault rifle with no background checks, etc. Hell Faux news is known for being stupid bubbling down to when they tried blaming the naval garden shooting on GTA5 which wasn't even available yet and the NRA will never say that allowing armor piercing bullets in which the shooter was able to kill a whole swat team was their fault, they got it from call of duty, fallout, etc. Moral of the story: If they start talking about video games during a school shooting, switch the channel because they are f*cking retarded"
24896,How is pokemon supposed to be witchcraft? I mean... the pokemon are in little pokeballs comfortable of course and if you want to call them out they can fight for you... no witchcraft involved...
24897,all of the contreveries pissed me off...
24898,"I personally absolutely hate the ""game guns blamed for real guns"" thing. Most of those reports of games blamed for shooting go like ""this guy killed 30 people, and he also played a game with guns... SO THAT IS THE ONLY REASON HE SHOT 30 PEOPLE!!!"""
24899,Pokemon? really? ppl are so butthurt
24900,5:27 stupid fucking bitch has no idea what she is saying.
24901,I don't get the controversy about war games. Kids have always played war with fake weapons. Video games are just the most popular fake weapon right now.
24902,"Although some games are pretty bad, just because I play shooting games doesn't mean I'm a mass murderer."
24903,3:46. Yogscast Kim?
24904,That Trevor torture scene made me cringe a little but I actually liked it being in the game. But I've seen worse in movies so its not even a big deal to me.
24905,OK manhunt I can understand being banned but it's just a fucking game for shitting out loud geesh
24906,What about the controversy in Cuba about trying to kill Fiedel Castro in Black Ops 1? Cuba was in outrage because of this? Wouldn't this come on the list?
24907,I love how almost every single clip is from Fox.
24908,"Remember Left for Dead? They removed the ""Missing Finger"" from the cover for all Australian copies :T"
24909,I would like to see a top 10 cartoon andchildren'sprogramming controversies.
24910,"The right wingers who blame mass murders on video games are as dumb as the left wingers who blame mass murders on guns. The problem is the people doing them. Trying to take away something that may incite violence is just stupid, unfair, and will accomplish the opposite of what you are trying to do, by inciting violence for taking away rights."
24911,"people are blaming games like it is a terrible past time, satanic, etc. I mean come on! it's not like virtual weapons kill REAL people. It's the people who kill people, not games."
24912,maybe if america wants to stop shootings they should stop people from buying assault rifles rather than just blaming a game that's like saying TV chefs are the reason people are fat
24913,"Nothing makes me want to choke the fuck out of a news anchor like seeing a highlight reel of ignorance when it comes to the gaming medium
clarification for all the idiots I don't actually want to choke anyone. it's verbal illustration of my frustration. That apparently needs to be said given the ridiculous nature of some of those reports.
The claims made by a lot of these news anchors are baseless and ignorant. Oh it's so graphic! so are Stallone movies... Oh it's so realistic!... yeah and so is CGI blood in virtually every hollywood movie for the last 10 years. As for stepping into the role of your character in games... you don't instantly lose your morals the second you pick up a controller... god these people are morons."
24914,"-_- people are morons. in most of the instances, you are ending/activating codes and programs within the game's hardware and such. you aren't killing real people, just lines of codes."
24915,I hope some day they will make a newManhunt :/
24916,"I have played Grand Theft Auto since I was a kid, I have played the most gruesome, gory, and violent games you could play at the age of 6. Never in my life did I decide to shoot up a school or try and kill someone because I did it in a video game. Why? Because I had parents that taught me right instead of parents who ignored, and neglected me. Video games aren't the cause for violence. If a child is taught and mentored by their parents like they should have been, they will not harm anyone and will understand what happens in a game is fiction, not fact."
24917,"you gotta love fox news and msnbc, i tell ya."
24918,super columbine massacre rpg
24919,Fire Temple Theme
24920,"I guess Fox News should boycott sports too, since they have tendencies to provoke riots . Or do they not have an agenda?"
24921,Nailed it.
24922,us banned war video games hahahahahaha ohh you fat fuckers are so twisted!
24923,Come on guys. You can't put together a list of controversial video games without mentioning Phantasmagoria!
24924,Video games are stupid and a waste of time
24925,"COD, realistic XD about as real as their brain cells, COD is fun, but not realistic..."
24926,"@1: Don't blame the ease with which a teenager can get possession of a gun, don't blame their doctor for not noticing the kid might have mental issues, and in most cases, don't blame the other kids who take the piss out of the victim. Blame Videogames instead. Honestly, I have played a lot of violent videogames and have never harmed a human being unless it was out of self defence, but even then, we're strictly talking about keeping the attacker away."
24927,"Just like how people blame a gun for a shooting and not the.. Hmm, you know. Shooter."
24928,I find this stupid. Gaming is a big hobby of mine and i would never have the nerve to shoot someone.
24929,Manhunt 2 is a great game and you can pirate the uncensored version.
24930,"the pokmon ones I can understand, but the one about Jynx isn't racist."
24931,"Oh, and fuck Jack Thompson."
24932,"The media is so half assed. They blame video games for every little thing. Some of those fuckers should realize that some of these video games are realistic fiction and could happen, such as Call of Duty and GTA. It happens in real life, but the story is fictional. Oh, but video games are to blame. What about movies? You don't bitch about movies! What about books? You don't bitch about that either. Also, Hilary Clinton is a cunt. Of what I heard, she is going to ban M-Rated games if she becomes president. Fucking passive aggressive ugly snatch whore. No wonder why Bill Clinton cheated on you."
24933,"Sad thing is, Fox News is a news organization full of hypocrites and liars, yet people watch and listen to them."
24934,its the same every time some kind of new device is released it is just a way for the press to keep us scared for our child's safety
24935,Heres what I don't understand. so if we can't make that army game why have we been allowed to make games about the vietnam war where millions died.
24936,i thought it was awesome to be a terrorist on mw2 i loved killing all them people on it.
24937,"It seems that video games are the scapegoat for just about everything these days.  Person is shot, video games are to blame.  Car crashes, video games are to blame.  Furries, video games to blame...  That last one may or may. Of be true however..."
24938,I wish the media would stop blaming video games and gamers for violent people in most mass shooting it was revealed the shooter was mentally unstable yes loads of video games are violent but are we no
24939,"I am Australian, and the only reason good R18+ games don't get in the contrary is because of the old aged government we have. it is a 200 year old system originally set up to look after prisoners. also, the people that work out if a game can get a classification do not live in the real world, or keep up with the times. I have to order in the games that get banned, it sux."
24940,I agree with the women at the end of the video. People always blame video games for violence around the world and not realizing that most of these people who commit these acts of violence are not right in the head.
24941,"The media and some public are more offended by non-real games than they are about actual rape, murder, and terrorism"
24942,"How long will it take for those fucktards at fox to realise that THEY'RE JUST GAMES, and that they're not real"
24943,5:05she is a dumb bitch that doesnt know what the fuck she is talking about
24944,"In some cases, a violent video game or movie can inspire already sick or damaged persons to imitate the scenes that they witness or take part in. A normal person isn't going to be turned into a serial murderer by a violent video game. But a person already prone to violence may be moved to act when they see their video game heroes acting in a similar sociopathic way. However, banning a game because certain individuals may derive inspiration from it is as stupid as bricking up the doors into a bank because robbers may use them to enter."
24945,Murican Cults and their anti Pokemon rants though. Surely that was a laughing stock for the American Public to laugh at?
24946,"I wish people would stop blaming games for all the bad things that happen, and realize that bad parenting, mental illnesses and such are the real causes. Because normal people don't become crazy murderers because of games, since they can differentiate between the games and real life. :)"
24947,"I love FOX News, but in this case they are so wrong."
24948,"Did they ever stop to consider that maybe it's not the ""Video Games"" that are the problem, but the people who actually play them because oh...just say they were...Bat shit crazy to begin with! & the Parents who buy their mentally unstable 15 yr olds games that are clearly labeled ""Mature"" or give them free access to Amazon and ebay where they can order these games without id. and the lazy parents who never bother to see what kind of games their bat shit crazy kids are playing!...just a thought :)"
24949,humans need to stop bitching about games blame it on the parents
24950,"i bet you that if at leasta fraction of these people who complain about these violent games actually shut up and played them, videogames would all of a sudden be good, and notthe cause of every little problem in the world."
24951,call of duty's the best and im still a normal everyday kid
24952,parents just dont get it
24953,top 10 fictional characters when they get angry
24954,"well yeah fuck christianity,simply cant stand those people hating everything thats fun and new"
24955,3:26 what game is that?
24956,games are the only thing left that keeps me from shooting with REAL guns!!!
24957,The one factor alot of mass shootings have in common that ive seldomly seen an emphasis on is that most of the shooters have mother issues. Plus the cases where a legally armed citizen puts a stop the the shooter are seldomly mentioned on national news.
24958,oh this stuff always makes me laugh i dont what it is but these morons are just so funny espicialy the guy who thinks pokemon is teaching kids how to use witchcraft you would think he would point the witchraft finger at a game like world of warcraft but no hes attacking pokemon forget watching comedy central these morons are the real comedians
24959,I think banned in Australia because I am half Australian and I hate these sorts of things
24960,"Most of these things are ridiculous to me because I'm a gamer, but... yeah, that No Russian section was kinda heavy even for me."
24961,the woman dressed in pink at 5:28 is nuts she is the one getting all madd about the sinefield festivus pole in 2013
24962,What about bully?
24963,"what is it called when people/life irk you? i don't like people that unjustly hatred towards things living or non-living. especially when their research is done on a small focus of people and then they use that as a general guideline to follow, i.e. the populous consensus. adults only? please... aren't we having issues with adults (government) making decisions already? anything that is perceive by the human senses regardless of what is about: video games, music, education, politics religion, can be form of terrorism on a person's mind. i do agree that mental issues is a big problem, but i doubt it comes or starts from a game nor that alone if it were the case. why? because me as well as anyone that has a mental issue would agree that the problem started from human interaction(s). so... what is it called when the people that you interact with in your life causes you to have a mental break down when you hear their name, them talk, or see or know about their presence that you would want to... for a lack of a better phrase... ""cast them out""? if you ask me how i feel... i'm disappointed"
24964,"Don't blame video games for killings, More people died at the open of the batman movie then have ever died due to video games rating system."
24965,Gotta fucking love Fox News.....oh wait
24966,NRA always looking to blame something except access to guns
24967,"Oh and fyi, coming from a post grad in psychology and bio and an on going doctorate, there is NO substantial evidence that there is a direct correlation between violent games and violent behavior. Growing up I played GTA on the original Playstation and I in no way shot up my school, not even with all the bullying and teasing I got and let me tell you GTA became an outlet for me. But I didn't take a shotgun and go to town because biologically I am not programmed like that. I find it hard killing a bug for crap sake."
24968,I find it very comical that FAUX NOOSE (Fox News) is at the for-front of almost every controversy. I also find it funny that they never have much to say accept to ridicule people for every god damn thing. Fox how about we talk about your extreme right winged agendas and your unprofessional news anchors who do not know how to properly talk to their guests because they are so effing high and mighty. Sons of bitches. GOD I HATE FOX SO BAD.
24969,"It's pretty stupid blaming violence on video games. 99% of the people I know play FPS games on whatever platform.
People play Need for Speed; doesn't mean they drive 200 mph and take out traffic signs all day.
Seems like paranoia and it seems contagious in the media."
24970,"I never caught the story about Pokemon being considered ""demonic"" what a giant load of steaming garbage"
24971,"I use to LOVE ""NIGHT TRAP""!!"
24972,The other day I was going through my old email account out of boredom and came across one I had sent to Jack Thompson when I was ~13. He really pissed me off.
24973,"We gamers are NOT insane, we don't just think, ""OH I just shot 5 U.S. Marines in Battlefield 4, maybe I should get my coincidentally placed sniper rifle right here and go, shoot a fucking, I dunno, a Supreme Court Justice or something."" NO, WE ARE NOT RETARDED INSANE FUCKS LIKE THOSE BASTARDS. Either they have some serious mental issues, or a really fucking huge grudge against a lot of damn things."
24974,so the news didnt give any fucks about splatterhouse that game was freaking gory and they think mortal kombat is gory play splattlerhouse theyll see
24975,Wow Im a USMC vet and that is fucking bullshit. I wouldnt want someones hard earned work to be thrown out for any reason like that.
24976,"Does anyone even still view Fox News as credible? It really would surprise me though, republicans are dumb enough to believe Obama was born in Kenya and that he's a Muslim and that Mitt Romney has an IQ above that of roadkill."
24977,"Because murder, terrorism, gunfights, and rape never existed before video games."
24978,"god, those fucking morons piss me off SOOO bad! the people who trash talk games are stupid, ignorant, misinformed, hate mongering hypocrites who have nothing better to do than harass the video game industry and ruin games. and for places like Australia and some parts of Europe, many games are straight up BANNED because of these faggots, and for no reason.
    yes, manhunt 2 may be the exception, and the COD game on this list may be upsetting to some people, BUT.... If you don't like it, or it bothers you that much, DON'T FUCKING BUY IT!!!!! not to mention that almost NONE of those retards even PLAY games, and they clearly don't do any real research on the games they hate on because their information is BLATANTLY fabricated and in most cases are just plain deliberate lies just to slander the gaming industry.
    if them saying that POKEMON is a game made by devil worshipers to teach kids witchcraft and brainwash them into slaughtering fucking goats for satan isn't enough proof of them being EXACTLY what i called them, then it just proves that ignorance reigns supreme in todays society. it also proves that a VERY large portion of the Baby Boomer generation are straight up propaganda abusing, ignorant, selfish, hate mongering, hypocritical attention whores who will do and say anything just to get what they want and to control things they have NO BUSINESS getting involved with.
    and it's funny that you don't see most if any of these people complaining this much about violence and sex in movies or television. or about the amount of corruption in politics and the government, or anything else that ACTUALLY needs to be called out... oh no, that would actually be hard, so they stick with making shit up about video games because if they get what they want, it won't affect them in the slightest either way. they're truly bored, lazy fucks with nothing better to do than point fingers at other people about things they know nothing about, just because they're hate mongers who need something to rip on.
    And it's not just politicians who are guilty of this. the average joe (or jane) age 40+ typically fit into that category as well. in fact i think i just described most peoples parents who are over 20 years old. i'm 26 and my parents fit into that category as well. that's part of the reason i moved out at 18 lol (for me it didn't have anything to do with games, but they still act the way i described about everything else).
    i doubt those losers (along with bible thumpers) will ever let up in the case of video games. so i guess we'll just have to wait until they die off and get replaced by the next generation. (even tho that won't keep the jesus freaks off people's backs about everything lol) but that's a whole different subject that is equally damaging to society. in fact the jesus freaks are even worse than these guys if you ask me lol"
24979,how did rapelay not make this list...
24980,Ok so anytime the news brings up the reason why ppl kill bcuz gta influenced em is bs dey only say dat ta get props and dat aint fair cz when i play shooter i think of em as entertain meant and fun cz ik i cant just press da restart button and magicly be brought back ta life sooo stop with the violent and sexual video game shit cz its not fair dat video games get banned cz of dis cz ppl work dere ass off tryin to get errthing set up fa da game
24981,News stations and politicians allwaysays want something to bitch about
24982,"Of all the games.... Pokemon?
I have no more hope for our society"
24983,"Slaughtering people in movies is okay, but in video games now that's going too far.
- EVERY Fox News Reporter"
24984,Only reason Fox news hates gaming is because they know the community can see through all their bullshit.
24985,"I think Madworld should have been an honorable mention, as the game was hated by parents because it was on the Wii."
24986,why is everything blamed on games :/
24987,"without video games, what would the media blame violence on?"
24988,"OK OK... WOW. Holy shit. COD can actually teach you something... like MW1, MW2, AND MW3 because it brings you through a little storyline of the World War and what the REAL soldiers went through!!! COD:BO2 it shows about terrorism and fighting like a REAL soldier and excellent Multi-Player!"
24989,Why do people have to be soooo sensitive to this type of stuff? IT'S A GODDAMN GAME.
24990,GTA should have been higher up. When hasn't that game been blamed for an event?
24991,"As humans we have a natural sick desire to see fucked up shit like what's in these games today. One of the originals being the coliseum in Rome. I think even if you didn'thave a ""mental illness"" before playing, you're definitely fostering the one you didn't know you had.Once you figure out why your brain is so easilydrawn totwisted, gory murder-porn bullshit, you'll realize that the gaming corporations know exactly what they're doing by feeding you're fetish.
P.S. Fuck Hassleback's patriot @ct"
24992,fUCK FOX
24993,If they thought that original mortal combat was bad they should see the modern day one!
24994,all of them pissed me off
24995,"3 words
Isaac
eye
machine :O"
24996,"Attack violent movies, shows, and commercials that are backed by credited publishers, but dont trash talk on the small no-name game developers. Fuck the media and all the white soccer moms in it."
24997,This is the thing I hate about the media. Just seeing this video pisses me off. The media doesn't give a SHIT about who they effect or if they are telling is really true. All they care about is the damn money. Greedy pigs.
24998,"#1 is really annoying to me. As a 15 year old, I am not allowed to get games I would love to play with my friends such as Grand Theft Auto V. While I am technically under the age of purchase, I'm pretty sure I'm old enough to decide what I should do with the information given to me by the game."
24999,the point of doom is to kill demons from hell
25000,All this makes me want to do is go and punch all the reporters at Fox News.
25001,7:17 and this is why I very rarely use my debit card for online shopping and gaming.
25002,What game is this 3:25 from?
25003,"All very true, but I do feel video games are disproportionately violent as compared to other media. It's also done in a more adolescent manner. Ofcourse, games are still predominantly for adolescents. Specifically white, male, heterosexual adolescents but then what else is new? It just seems more magnified in the game medium."
25004,how did postal 2 not end up on the list lol
25005,ok i wish the people in the media and congress would get that im an adult and if i want to play the most mind numbing and morally questionable game i have the right to because it my choice and just because i play a violent game does not mean im going to go shoot up a school or some other crime because the demonic game made me want to do it the people that do it are undeniably mentally disturbed
25006,how is sex with an alien realistic
25007,lol The media is retarded.
25008,"I don't get number 4 why do people complain and stop the game being made because there family members fought in the war and were killed, yet wolr war games are fine and loads of people lost loved ones. People need to realise that game devs aren't making games to make fun and laugh and killing people but doing it so they can tell the story."
25009,just middle-aged moaning
25010,you now what fuck those people that say pokemon is wiche craft
25011,I find that some people are stupid enough to say all games lead to school shootings when what only one or two people in school shootings are video game players why don't they do actual research into the persons life they will find they were either bullied or something else was going on in their life
25012,Why is everyone such a pussy nowadays?
25013,Anyone know what the black and white game is at 8:30? Looks cool.
25014,The world of pokemon is teaching your kids how to do witchcraft how to cast spells. LOL!!!
25015,I love how Fox News is in most of these controversies...
25016,"One thing people rarely seem to notice in the MW2 no Russian mission is that the game doesn't tell you to shoot the civilians, gamers just do it because they can"
25017,That lady who is talking as the video concludes makes the most sense out of anyone debating about Violence in Video Games.
25018,#1easily
25019,I remember the sheer balls the media had to blame that tragedy on GTA5... which literally happened the day before its public release
25020,hello kitty island
25021,"I'm surprised the Mario series doesn't spark controversy. I know it sounds ridiculous, but hear me out; You play as a guy who kills his enemies in many ways, including but not limited to:
crushing their skulls
burning them alive
dropping them into boiling magma"
25022,Why is Fox news in the midst of everything?
25023,"Violent game makes players violent ? So we should all play Monopoly to be rich, if we follow the logic..."
25024,"It's actually quite simple.Some youngmen naturally have more testosterone, that coupled with a history of psychotic behavior. So naturally when they play a game, it's not teaching them anything, just affecting what was already wrong with the child. I watched Predator at 6 years old.....saw a guys skull pulled out of his body connected to his spinal cord.....I have yet to kill anybody. So basically the child has a pre-existing condition and the games exacerbate it, but they in no way instill a violent outlook in the child."
25025,Fox news really get on myGoddamn nerves.
25026,"Hah the Fallujah one was retarded, who gives a fuck when American soldiers die?
The son of this woman knowingly took the risk of dying when he went fighting useless attack war for the corrupt US government, a war that totally destroyed Iraq and made it even worse place than under rule of Saddam.
It's all natural selection, if you don't want to die don't join the US military which isn't really hasn't done anything good after WW2 anyway.
The Iraqi civilians killed by Americans didn't get to choose."
25027,That No Russian mission was CRAY!!! My jaw was stuck to the ground for a good while.
25028,"Manhunt 2 not availible? Sorry, but sure there is a torrent somewhere,,if cant go legally, then can go the other way"
25029,Don't you love how most of these anti-video game news clips are from Fox?
25030,The most realistic sex act ever conceived - im not sure that having sex with a blue alien with tentacles for hair (who can get inside your mind) while being on a spaceship light-years away from Earth qualifies for that. That guy is either Japaneese or never had sex before.
25031,pll shuld just shutop
25032,"The Faluja one is by far the worst.
Insread of honewring her sons memory (it was her sons squad helping to write and tell THEIR - her son - story.
That game would have sown the magnitude of war crimes the us does every day."
25033,8:33 all of them
25034,All of these pissed me off hahaha
25035,I don't get how games can piss people off they are fictional and did nothing to other real people.
25036,There should be a video game that's made targeting and killing every big video game hater like that bitch from Fox news or that ex lawyer who lost his jobs cause of his obsessive hate of video games
25037,i would much rather be around a mass murderer in video games then real life
25038,"Really? Saying that the games are completely innocent, but then blaming the gun? Really? Why not blame the people/things ACTUALLY responsible? How about the parents that ignored any early warning signs of mental instability in their children? How about the person that actually pulled the trigger?
Blaming the guns is no different than blaming the games. They both share the same amount of responsibility, which is zero."
25039,Thats just bullsh*t just because YOUR kid has mental problems does not make a game bad to the people I've played Call of Duty since COD2 I've played GTA since they very first one teach you kid to keep it in the game or dont let them play
25040,Well that australia one isnt true because I live there and we can buy saints row 4...
25041,"My answer to the QOTD is the Pokemon Peta Scandal, The lame game of shootings and games and the ACB derping with ratings."
25042,"Just a clarification for the ""Banned in Australia""
The only reason why games such a s Fallout and Outlast were banned was because of the realisitc representation of drugs, and the realistic drugs being used to benefit the player which apparently encourages the use of illegal drugs.
And the reason why Saints Row IV was refused was because it apparently displayed sexual violence but wasn't in a justifiable way."
25043,"When I play COD I don't think ""Damn, I should try that shit and kill a few innocent people!"" I just think ""Gotta get my kill streaks, gotta get them!"""
25044,The theater shooting was a false flag publicity stunt to regulate gun control.
25045,"The theater shooting was set up. Its called population control. 9/11 boston bombings etc. Witnesses said there was multiple gun shots coming from more than one direction at the premiere of ""the dark knight"". The guy who was blamed is a victim of MK ultra. Wake the fuck up people. Dont take it from me do your own research. Keep a third eye open. Wake the fuck up!"
25046,I hate the fucking media so much. They are a bunch of fucking assholes.
25047,"Gahhh! Every time someone starts on that BS about video game violence begets real life violence (#1) I want to scream! Instead I go on a 10 minute rant at whoever is nearest over that flaming load of horse pucky. So, because I enjoy disemboweling and beheading my virtual enemies in a virtual environment, I am going to go on a psychotic rampage?! Gaahhhhh!!!!!"
25048,gestapo
25049,I've grown up with GTA. You don't see me going and killing people or jacking cars etc... These news corporations need someone or something to blame and they choose video games.
25050,"i feel like GTA shouldve been more explained and higher on the list
""No Russian"" from MW2 brought back nostalgia and i just remember the love for that game and not how it was scary at all, i was a lot less mature then and didnt realize the harm it potentially had, but that can show that these games are not as influential as one may think"
25051,those controversies are so bs
25052,"Parents lose children to cigarette's everyday, nothing being done. lol Hippocratics at fox news, please all die."
25053,"Interesting to note: The Call of Duty WM2 Airport massacre never tells you to shoot, you don't have to shoot, and nothing different happens if you don't shoot... but we all shoot."
25054,"For the last one, I did a speech talking about the benefits that videogames can have and how it can improve certain skills and 2 of my friends (siblings) started saying how videogames can make people violent or whatever and I explained how it's completely on the person's mental state and any disabilities/delusionals/illnesses they may have that's to blame, not videogames and they even went so far to ask ""What if a person is playing a videogame to get better at a skill to use for evil?"" and with almost a WTF? face, I calmly said ""Then something's clearly wrong with that person as there are numerous other ways to improve your skills outside of videogames, and if you really wanted to use it for evil, videogames is NOT something you'd even consider."" Luckily one of my other friends completely shut them up when he stated how murderers have used books and movies as inspiration."
25055,"When will Fox news get it through their thick skull? No matter how hard they try, they will NOT get rid of the gaming community."
25056,Ugh... I hate the public
25057,Violence + plus shity reporters + killings = video games are the culprit. FACE PALM
25058,"I'm sorry but the Russian scene from Modern Warfare 2 did the exact opposite as to me as to what the chairmen from FoxNews claimed. I was left in awe and that scene sent chills down my spine, hearing the peoples cries for help and watching as they hopelessly lost their lives in a matter of seconds. If anything it made me never want to pick up a gun in real life, let alone use it to go on a killing spree. To this day, I still can barely handle that scene. Good Job Infinity Ward. To anyone who actually found that scene to be remotely funny or getting a rush of ""excitement"" from watching it... You should probably get that checked out."
25059,Fuck Fox News
25060,"Well the news and media blame everything on Video Games just to get the scoop of a lifetime and now it's getting old, heh they don't understand that it's the people that start the shootings or terrorist threats faults."
25061,"it just makes me pissed that people think #1. You'd think kids my age (16) would know the difference between video games and real life. sadly, there are idiots who think that since they're really good at COD, they have a chance at joining the military"
25062,OMG that was kim from the yogscast talking to the saints row guy
25063,"If we humans were allowed to enter heaven (without the exception of Jesus Christ), heaven would be just as corrupt as earth, humans are corrupt beings and that is why when we die we go to hell, we are Born to die and go to hell, that is our predistined destiny. The Bible says, that even a sinful thought will send you to hell, do you really believe that you would enter heaven with these games in your mind? if even a sinful thought will land you to hell, then what about the thought whilst playing a game to gruesomely murder someone! The most horrifying thing is, YOU ARE HAPPY, IT SATISFIES YOU to murder on video games, this means that Your heart is EVIL. Jesus Christ said, it is not what goes into a man that makes him evil, but it is what comes out of a man that makes him evil. So if your output is to think to massacre a bunch of russians as in that game, then you are evil. But God knows that we cant be holy, thus the ONLY way for you to enter heaven is through accepting Jesus Christ as your LORD and savior. Jesus Christ is God's only mercy for us. And there is Absolutely no other way to heaven for no human can save himself. And it does not stop there, because humans are unfaithful, we need to live and try to please God, by reading the Bible. Everyone that goes to hell knows the truth about Jesus Christ, they knew the truth, but decided to mock him. You are a spirit living in a body, that body does not represent you, you have never seen who you really are, until your body dies then the truth will be revealed. Keep on mocking but you know the truth, no excuses! Only one way to heaven, JESUS CHRIST!"
25064,"It's kind of funny it's the same exact people blaming virtual guns that refuse to ever consider any limits whatsoever on REAL FUCKING GUNS!
Republicans are simply insane."
25065,"Anyone else noticing a trend here? It seems sex is a bigger deal than violence.
Only in America... Alright, that's not fair. It's the same in Saudi Arabia."
25066,Number three was just stating a legit reason for world war three. It's not like its teaching your son to buy guns and slaughter Russians -_\|
25067,Wait...Let's all request every news station to all our thought and comments on how stupid they are on most some vids on the internet that we KNOW they're stupid.
25068,One major problem in this video: most of the news clips are from Fox News.
25069,The news needs real gamers to get hired that are concerned for children.Why are they so stupid?
25070,"6:41... i worked for that news station, CBS11...."
25071,"Thank you Fox News, we still dont give a shit."
25072,I say the press can kiss my ass cause is just its just a game.
25073,i think the people tlaking aobut guns cause people to shoot people in real life are saying that just to say it cause they are bored and are idiots
25074,Those people should stop complaining about everything. A game is a game and not reality
25075,ye and omg wow were you walk around slaughtering inocent boars for such a thing as exp. make sure we band that from the world and rebuild our rainforrest and climate...oh..i forgot that probably has somthing to do with videogaming too...lets just all blame all the world probmens on videogames and be done with it
25076,What about the Islamic chant and symbols in Ocarina of Time?
25077,"Am I the only one that liked how they put the Russian airport level in MW2? If you have any idea about what is actually going on, its not going to encourage you to kill people, it will actively discourage it. If you hear people screaming and dying and you think want to go shoot people cause of it, then you have more problems. Not to mention the fact that it also displays how America isn't an ultimate force of good, it does some bad things too. It was after all an undercover agent doing that. In my opinion, it was one of the better decisions made for MW2."
25078,so they raise hell about a violent video game but barely any on movies?
25079,My Mum thinks that in gta 5 you get to rape people for some reason.
25080,If you try to blame killings because of a game you're gonna have a bad time.
25081,for me it was all the Pokemon crap
25082,"if the media would shut the fuck up about games being violent it would help the people playing it. here is the thing gun massacres are cuaesd because PEOPLE WHO HAD GUNS PLAYED FIRST PERSON SHOOTERS blame them not the game, yes no Russian was like being a terrorist but you could of skipped it AND you didn't need shoot anyone (I stayed back and shot no one). besides games like gta cod and other first person shooters they aren't as gorey or bloody as manhunt 2 and mortal kombat but doom 3 was kinda satanic though."
25083,any wonder Fox is the one finding the most offensive.... betcha these games are in their kid's PSP and XBox... behind mommie and daddie's back
25084,Its not video games to take the fall for what someone did int the real world
25085,People who dont play or are not versed on video games have not authority to speak about them.
25086,5:55 - If call of duty kids rule the world
25087,Glad i played frist COD MW2 before my little brother. My mom would kill me for it X_X
25088,"The introduction really got me mad about the 'Video Game makes fun of being adopted"". The reporters should have at least done some fucking research before slapping Portal 2 on the screen and saying ""Hey look, the game is obviously bad and discriminating because one segment makes fun of adopted people. The major point though, is that it doesn't. Everyone who played the game up to that point should be able to tell that Wheatley is a complete moron, and isn't making serious insults. ALSO, GladOS comes to the defense RIGHT after that scene. Just my opinion, as an avid fan of the Portal franchise. Hope this doesn't sound like raging, but wow..."
25089,u know wut i hate from the news guys? they don't look at violent movies(SAW and screams) wich they make u watch ppl getting tortured and nobody gives a fuck but when a flash torture game gets released everybody looses their minds
25090,"2:25 Yeah, some people lost their children in that battle. Thats true. The same thing happened in WW2, yet there are more WW2 games than I can count."
25091,FOX: Making up left-winged bullshit because we have flashy looks and absolutely no professionalism.
25092,movies are a lot more disturbing and realistic in my opinion. video games are cartoons lol
25093,the real answer for number 1 is simple. 'Murica
25094,Nun of these are true
25095,id have thought that killing prostitutes in gta wasnt mentioned. those anti gaming bastards love making it seem like the entire point of the games are to target and kill them as violently as possible. maybe these peopl should actually see the proper gameplay in context instead of just picking out minute aspescts to suit their own agenda.
25096,"What violent video games was Charles Whitman playing? How about Stalin's Russia Gulag thugs who happily gave the invisible brand or the Nazi's who ran concentration camps?
Seems like fucked up people are going to be fucked up. Jodie Foster set off one psycho, are we going to ban Jodie Foster."
25097,People who genuinely believe the claims the press make about video games are absolute idiots. Dumb cows. Or sheep one might say...
25098,FACT:Pokemon players have killed less real animals than PETA.
25099,Postal 2 anyone?
25100,The Pokmon Part Is Caveman films!
25101,"that statement at 5:00 really upsets me. She focuses only on a minority of gamers that would probably do that anyway, instead of the majority of gamers who would shame these gamers,and would give their respect these soldiers.Plus it would enlighten gamers about a particularly terrible event. I hadn't even heard of the event until this video to be honest.
....but noooooo, I am afraid that one guy is gonna not take it seriously."
25102,ironically fox news dare to cover controversies
25103,"Its really the parents fault most of the time lol If people would spend more time with their kids other than just throwing games at them and not checking the ratings just to keep em quiet , I dunno thats my opinion anyways"
25104,Dayum Hitler must have played some sick video games back in the time...
25105,"sorry the MK backlash is #1, it spurred the rating system, was pulled for six months before mk2, nothing else came close ,everything else were media fueled conservatives looking for an excuse to blame bad parenting , but MK started it , that needed to be #1"
25106,fuck the media they can all go shove dildos up each other
25107,3:42 Yogscast kim!
25108,if any one hates video games they can go get fucked and run around like a bunch of running queefs
25109,"Sooo... what? Do some people just think that you can put blood, violence, sex, drugs, etc into any medium as long as it isn't interactive? Do they realize that sex is interactive already? And harmless?"
25110,"0:45 ""video game"" makes fun of adoption? The breadth of your terminology is absurd. How's this: TV show makes a fool of themselves."
25111,Es que es la falta de creatividad que lleva a los disenadores de juego a estos extremos. Ni siquiera se ven reales las imagenes no se porque se enfocan en esto tan asquerosos y repugnantes de estos juegos porque no hacen de aventuras sanas como las peliculas y olvidence de temas de terror que son repugnante
25112,the news people in this are so fuckin stuoid man jesus
25113,The true problem is I still can't turn on the news without seeing or hearing about adam lanza the news made him a celebrity of kinds.
25114,Maybe if people would grow up and stop blaming peoples actions on stuff like video games I can tell you I play Battlefield I want to be a Marine I play GTA V it's stupid fun to play with friends lets look at the whole picture instead of just one little pixel of it
25115,No Russia was one of the best moment of video game moments for me... FYI i didnt killed anyone but it was....
25116,"Lets look at the 'video games cause killing argument.' When the Xbox One/PS4 came out the sold over way over 10 million copies but I will use the number 10 million for this argument. If video games truly caused the mass shootings then we would have over 10 million mass shootings on our hands. Now there have not been an increase of shootings since the new generations came out and there have not been many 13-18 year old shooters (Sorry if there have been a couple young ones, i do not live in America where the majority of the shootings happen.) The shooters have all been shown to have mental stability issues and if a person is unstable you can't blame it on anything except the fact the person had mental issues. But if a person is unstable video games are not the only violence source out there, most movies contain a lot of violent content and movies have just am much influence as video games would and a lot of large hip-hop/rap artist music contain many violent ideas and music and TV/movies has never been called the cause of shootings, so to single handedly blame video games is shallow minded and they are just looking for an excuse for the shooters actions, if a person is mentally unstable they are mentally unstable, leave it at that. I would like to note i'm not trying to say I support shootings or anything like that I am simply reviewing the facts about what happens"
25117,Most of those are not banned in Australia anymore witcher 2 still has nude and all the other games just l4d2 is the one standing although you can just get a mod to remove the no gore Aus version
25118,In saudi arabia gta is banned but u can get it but hard
25119,mw2 no russian mission was a bit over the top
25120,It's totally videogames fault for all those massacres... it has nothing to do with usa habit to give away guns like candies...
25121,i live in Australia im a full time gamer but i get my games from steam and have no problem
25122,"so stuuupid... its ok to go to war but it's not ok to make a video game depicting what happens when a country goes to war.I wish there was more sex and violence in video games just to piss these ""NEWS JOURNALISTS"" off. Why are video games STILL such a great scapegoat for why society is the way it is? it's just so cliche' but violent and horrible people are gonna fucked up shit regardless of call of duty or GTA!"
25123,Its amazing that they blame violence in games for mass shootings and yet it would seem that anyone can get a gun over their. Maybe thats the problem? This is a good vid showing this side of the argument.
25124,Fuck the media. I hate that loads of games are banned or censored in australia (where I live) The media make constant fake claims.
25125,I love how most of the butthurt news people are on Fox News.
25126,It's not the 1st person shooters that cause the killing sprees. It's the fact that you can buy a gun ( In the US) as easy as buying one in black ops. To be honest why does one need a gun. Self defence ?. No. God gave you hands.Of course if your out in Iraq then it's fine. I meant I don't know many people who fight the Taliban with bare hands.
25127,"I do not play these kind of video games and probably never will, never heard of several of the abovementioned and was horrified by the top three, just that it was mostly Fox News, and that moron Hasselbeck (sp?) acting like she knows anything about anything, makes me want to go and buy them and put them in the Toys for Tots bins."
25128,Fuck the press
25129,i am surprised that Resident Evil 5 didn't make at least the honorable mentions due to the fact so many people yelled racism about it.
25130,i really wish six days in fallujah would have been made. i know people argue about there loved ones dying there and having a game depicting it but i think for people who may not know what goes on in actual war it would be very insightful. movies do this all the time but people having fun with a game and possibly learning a lesson is frowned upon. i understand there distaste for it but what better way to immortalize there loved ones and help there memory live on. not to mention we can better understand there sacrifice.
25131,dont worry video games wont die why because they make money its hard kill giant money makers
25132,"So what is their excuse for school shootings, 50 years ago when the only video games that existed were ""Tennis for Two"" or ""SpaceWars""? Or 100 years ago when they didn't exist at all? Bunch of political PUSSY'S!! That need their names in the headlines."
25133,No Russian is my favorite mission on MW2..
25134,"I bet everyone noticed the most common occurrence with these controversies is the news media and non gamers. I hate it that they need to get involved and say the most bullshit, wrong statements possible. They haven't played the game or other games to know what its like to be a gamer and love to play this. #4especially saddens me because of the fact that the dumb non gamer community freaked out so much it caused a full out cancelation of a game (although it honestly didn't look very good to me) It's just so frustrating to see people do things like this. The only good thing I can think of that could come out of this is since Cod is the big popular player the media targets them a lot so hopefully someday the media will finally end Cod otherwise it will be here for a long, long time........."
25135,"The supposed #1 controversy that you had, is basically what makes most of them deemed to be ""offensive"", so #1 just seems like a waste of time..........."
25136,"I've played Cooking Mama and I don't consider myself a chef.
I've played Don't starve and I don't consider myself a wilderness survival expert.
I've played Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell and I don't consider myself a master of stealth.
So why would I play GTA and consider myself a selfish, unkind human being with a lack of sympathy?
They're video games people. video GAMES (GAMES=PRETEND)"
25137,Fuck Fox News here's a scary though you guys are allowed to be televised.
25138,"Fox news, Fox news everywhere, why am I not surprise?"
25139,Damn conservatives with there video game blame bull shit
25140,"If you ask me, news stations are kind of jerks when it comes to ""violent video games"""
25141,"The reasons the news crews give are very valid, but when hey say StarCraft was to blame for multiple school shootings, hat was crossing the line for me. But, i do see why parents and other adults are fearful."
25142,"our stupid governments in Australia are making us look like pussies, if games are rated r18+ then it means it's for adults, by banning them it means that adults cannot do what they want to do, making them feel like an 8 year-old, so SCREW YOU AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS"
25143,8:47 That woman tells the whole truth about shootings not just a game a mental illness that makes someone want o do what they have done in a video game trust me I have played ever call of duty multiplayer and single and never thought of killing anyone same with Battlefield and Grand Theft Auto
25144,i find it so funny that fox hates everything
25145,"You can't really consider a conservative blogger and Fox News to be two separate sources, can you?"
25146,"This was actually hard to watch. I'm a gamer and just watching this pissed me off. When people see a murder or other crimes, the first thing they do is blame it on something and what's the best thing to put the blame on? Games. They need to think a little and accept the truth that some people are just criminals by nature, instead of blaming it on everything else."
25147,"I think the reason news teams blame video games is because they need someone to blame. A lot of organizations who say something is horrible or satanic is because they need someone to blame, and they only do this because they want to look better by saying we don't do this or they want to put ideas into our head that anything even remotely violent is bad. Then there's the other option were it's all just some guy who hated that his big brother never let him play Sonic with his pals so he's taking out his anger at video games. Also it's not real!!!! Although, yes scenes like the one in MW2 is shocking and have no need since they could make it happen in entirely different ways, but IT'S NOT REAL.  The only people it might effect are people with mental health issues, and then WHY DID SOME IDIOT LET THEM PLAY CoD they don't know it's not real so they will go off and shoot people you dumbasses.
	Anyway stop hating on video games what if we did that with shows like Breaking Bad or Dexter, or even movies. Then would you understand. Sheesh"
25148,Who knew the media & numerous groups & activists could take stupidity to whole new levels.
25149,"now i play battlefield i've put 130+ hours into multiplayer (i don't do much with my time :p) and NEVER have i thought its ok to go shoot someone or go to my school and shoot everyone NEVER have i thought that now like me i hope everyone else that plays games just has much knows the difference between real life and games
i was taught it early cause i played a lot of games as a kid it was and still is my thing most parents when they buy their kid CoD or some other rated M game should think ""does he/she know the difference and can they tell which is good and which is bad"" and i see that not a lot of parents do that cause when i heat little kids(at lest they sound young) they call everyone a bitch or a fucker or cunt bag and shit like that
it just boggles the fuck
i just think that people get that games are solely for entertainment purposes and that we don't play them so we can become some amazing killer or some shit"
25150,"It pisses me off when the giverment blames shootings on video games, someone could be an artist or a musician and not play games and still do that, i myself find shooters as a way of releavibg stress for instance, left 4 dead 2 i found to be one that helped with that bc of the fact that you kill zombies that are endless. Video games arnt always to blane people -.-"
25151,why is it ok to remake almost any other war but not ok for the a recent conflict? Tasteless yes but no different than storming the beaches of Normandy in the most violent battle in war history.
25152,"I recall a video game from Japan where you molested girls in the subway, and there was quite a bit of rape in it. That definitely caused some controversy... very understandably, of course."
25153,"5:28 ""because some people lost their children in that battle."" Well fuck you bitch. Video games are a form of entertainment and can be a conduit for informing the public. Notice how only the people who had no experience with creating, producing, or even playing video games were the ones pointing fingers and ripping down countless hours of work. Fuck the media for killing ""Six Days in Fallujah."" I'm not going to assume that because the game never came to be that it would have automatically been good, but it sure as hell didn't deserve to be torn down for having some historical accuracy or some sensitive material. No war game should be tame, war is hell and everyone who plays a game about it or watches a movie about it should know that. Without that undertone it becomes propaganda and that kind of creation is harmful.That reporter at 5:28 stands on the graves of dead soldiers in Fallujah with her nose cocked in the air all high and might as she so pretentiously dismisses the game in front of its would-be creators. Fuck her and fuck conservative media. It's no coincidence that Fox News was immensely previlent in this video."
25154,I'm surprised the RE5 trailer being accused of racism wasn't on this list.
25155,"games like GTA and Saints Row 1-4 are fun as shit and yea its fucked up. i like to run over pedestrians and kill hookers cuz yunno its funny. but i know that its not real and its in no way realistic. thay being said, some of these video games are actually kinda fucked up. when the game actually makes it your mission to kill innocent people....thats where the line blurs a bit. and war games i dont really have anything against unless they base it off of actual battles like that one up there. also, there was a really controversial and fucked up game at one point that was released in Japan that was literally about how to stalk, rape, and kill women. it was really fucked up and should have been on this list."
25156,SPREAD THE WORD! MINECRAFT TEACHES KIDS THAT VANDALISM IS FUN! JOURNEY ADVOCATES SATANISM! PORTAL IS TEACHING KIDS TO SHOOT PEOPLE!
25157,The blaming of video games for mass shootings are based off of Fox News: The Birthplace of insane people.
25158,ok for most of them it makes sense but you have to at least know Doom was actually about demons and hell. I liked it though (no vertical aiming required and all)
25159,Games don't influence what anyone does its the person themselves that choose to do bad stuff
25160,Why does no one ever mention the press in the '90s accusing video games of giving kids Epilepsy?
25161,Not gonna lie that mw2 thing was very horrific
25162,I hate the news
25163,I wanna see people try to ban violent games there will be rallies anonymous will start going apeshit for censorship it will be hell
25164,Pls pls do top ten open world game
25165,The media knows what they are doing and they know they will convince idiot parents that games are influential in killing I do think kids need to know death is not a funny matter in real life if they play violent video games but even if they didn't I don't think they are going to go shoot up people
25166,"Jesus said ""So it will be at the end of the age,the angels will come forth and take out the wicked from among the righteous, and will throw them into the furnace of fire, in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.""Matthew 13:49-50. Jesus also said ""You are my friends if you do what I command you."" John 15:14. Jesus taught that the only way to be saved is to choose him as your Lord and Master, repent and believe that he died for the sins of his people on the cross see John 14:6."
25167,"I have to say: the news companies are completely stupid and only put fear into everyone's lives when it comes to video games. Almost every friend I have loves violent video games and not a single one has acted upon what they learned from a game. However, the news would spin unrelated incidents to them. Something like: 'Charlie got into a fight at school today when another student punched him first. His violent and wild anger problems and OBVIOUSLY murderous rage can only be attributed to playing Legends of Zelda: Twilight Princess'. stupid, stupid, stupid people. Obviously, I'm not saying that violent games has NEVER made someone do something crazy and violent, but the media makes it seem like EVERY person who plays violent games are violent"
25168,Yeah and people lost their lives in world war 2 yet did world at war get banned no neither should it people are ridiculous it's history it's going to get retold in one way or another
25169,"Me and my buddy John had to do a satire news cast for a school project. we made jokes to the ""1st person shooters create violence"""
25170,I miss Dana Plato.
25171,People who blame video games for atrocities are fucking idiots. Plain and simple.
25172,"Wouldn't ""the most realistic sex acts ever conceived"" be actually having sex?
Also the guy has never played any game from Japan."
25173,#1 Pisses me off. pretty soon they going to require a Background check to get a fucking videogame (pardon the language just so annoyed)
25174,"The last one reminded me of ""bowling for columbine"" by Mihael Moore"" check it out if you haven't already"
25175,no.not.pokemon.just.no.
25176,watch this if you love or hate Miley Cyrus You know who I hate.... Miley Cyrus
25177,Of course no of those statements are true..IT'S FOX NEWS CHANNEL!
25178,"I knew the ""No Russian"" scene would make it on here, The other game that wasn't on here, was ""Spec Ops:The Line, because in it, the titular character has to choose whether to risk more lives of his soldiers in a deadly firefight, or use white phosphorous( a munition that causes heated and smoldering burns upon contact) in order to save his men, but he chooses to use it. In doing so, he had killed hundreds of civilians, and the game shows this."
25179,your number one has pissed me off for awhile. people believe that shooter games that have even a speck of blood instantly turn kids into real life mass murderers. THAT'S NOT WHY PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE. millions and i mean MILLIONS of people play violent video games. should everyone be tested simply because they like to play an entertaining game that millions of others enjoy playing? just because some murderer played a violent game doesn't mean that is why he/she killed.
25180,"I don't think the games are specifically the issue.
- - First of all, children are affected by these games. When I was younger My friends and I would play a shooting game on the Nintendo 64. In this game one of the guns looked like a giant pencil and looked as if it shot out small disks. There was no way the game could convince us of ever picking up a gun.
- - Now these shooting games are too realistic for children in this day and age.
Oh... but only if there was a way to keep children under the age of 17 from playing these games. Wait there is a grading system and any gaming store prevents a child that is not within the age limit from buying the game.
- - The fault lies on the parents which allow kids from playing these games. Once games became too graphic (Grand Theft Auto and Manhunt), my mom wouldn't allow me to play that at my friends house. It is that simple parents.
Make a rule: Your children have to buy their own games. They have to be of age and use their own money. This limits the amount of graphic shooters your child will have.
- - - If you are of age you shouldn't be influenced by these games. The only adults who are influenced are the mentally ill.
- If games are really such a big concern, people should be tested before playing M rated games and proven to be mentally sane.
Message to the parents: Buying your kid a war game = Your kid wanting to join the Army
All of these kids now want to join the Army because they want to hold a gun, and shoot a gun, and even shoot a person. 10 year old's get influenced so easily... but 17+ year old's don't !
Hopefully I just saved a few lives. Don't let your kids act like dumb asses !"
25181,the morale of the story is FUCK FOX
25182,"the universal view that wow players has sold their soul to blizzard :D like when i told my girl friend that i played wow she started crying, wtf is that kind of reaction just cause its wow and apparently wow is so ""addictive"" compared to anything else that we wow players think wow are more important then our or others lives..."
25183,"death penalty is the answer to massive shooting, just forget human rights and trials"
25184,POKEMON?! WHY... JUST....WHY?!?!?!
25185,"A thing that many people don't seem to think about is that if video games didn't exist, all of these crimes would be blamed on another media. Be it books, music, movies, video games always get shit on simply because they're interactive."
25186,EA was recently harassed by Chinese press because bf4 gave China a false image
25187,the uncensored version of manhunt was released on PC but was taken off me:LOL YEAH RIGHT
25188,i wont be surprised if this kind of bullshit is why youngsters dont respect their elders
25189,The thing that losses me off most is that parents and ppl think that one kid will kill somebody because of a game like it only happens to messed up kids who rely do laugh when they kill A FREAKIN MEN
25190,omg f**k the channe that said portal 2 was bad
25191,shout out to the violent video games that caused every war before the 70's. Wait what do you mean they aren't real? How else would they have started?!
25192,"mental illness is a big problem -- Maybe, but I'd say it's automatic weapons that are the bigger problem."
25193,"I am tired of the media trying to blame real-life violence on video games, when the opposite is true. Not only is there proof that video games do not cause aggression, but in my experiences, games can help relax and keep you calm. The message should be simple: ""Kids, play with games, not guns!"""
25194,All
25195,Manhunt is still on steam.
25196,FPS Russia wishes to do this. unsubscribe FPS Russia and continue.
25197,Fox news just pisses me off in general
25198,so what about movies? I never here them talking about Hollywood.
25199,I hate that media makes all gamers out to be evil mass murderers waiting to happens because sometimes the people who commit these crimes are one of millions of people who happen to play games. I bet that they've all watched violent TV too but that never gets accused.
25200,"tbh all of them pissed me off. especially when they blame shootings on games like gta. psychos have always been around us and they always will be. i haven't met a single person that plays video games that were influenced by games to act out violence in real life.
games only show what happens in real life. like for the war game, of course her son didn't have a second chance. he was there in real life. the company wasn't trying to laugh at people who died in that war, they were trying to show what happened there and let the public experience it. people don't have a problem sending their children off to die in a bull-sht war with no purpose but they have a problem with a game that does no harm? lol society is a joke.
and i bet most of the psychopaths who kill people in real life don't even own a gaming console."
25201,the reason i hate cod
25202,if you got mad yall have issues.
25203,"hay guys come check out my channel I do left 4 dead, dayz, and other popular games iv just started out and iv already got a good amount of subscribers so give me a chance and come check out my channel and subscribe if you like it!.
Left 4 Dead 2 part 1: Eat your brains"
25204,"Sorry, but there's a discrepancy in this video. Manhunt 2 is not ""killing just for entertainment"". The people you kill are trying to kill you. You're killing to survive. Plus you have an evil split personality in your head prompting you to make each kill as sadistic as possible, but it's still against people who would do the same to you."
25205,what's wrong with this time? NOBODY HAS ANY FUCKING BASIC LOGIC
25206,"People need to stop blaming video games on violence, its not the games fault they just want to entertain you but the parents or the kids fault on what he does.
The way news reporters think is stupid"
25207,if video games cause violence... then what game has been out for 2000 years?
25208,"I don't try to see how offensive a game is, I just play it and have fun."
25209,free!http://hugegamesplace.com
25210,I knew people are dumb but to blaim video games for anything is rediculas just to put in some controversy lets say video games save lives. how you may ask though i'm sure you won't. lets say you have had a job for 14 years you have been pushed aside for promotions can't get a pay raise simply because they keep taking money from your department and flushing it into the CEO's pockets or what have you. the child of one of these million air's comes in with less credentials less experience and far lacking in people skills as yourself but is given the job cause his mommy or daddy owns the company. first day your work load doubles second day your job is threatened and finally before you snap you take it to a video game where you can release the stress and find a new job without going postal in real life due to some assholes decision to pass up someone who worked for the job to someone who has no business even seeing that particular field. there that should get someone going or at least the trolls.
25211,"The whole ordeal regarding real life crimes being influenced by video games is basically a scapegoat. The woman at 8:39 mentions that a shooter had mental health conditions and she's defending gaming by saying you can't base his actions on one video game, I partially agree that some individuals with mental health illnesses can be potentially more vulnerable to gaming's violent features.
However, I have to say that through all my near 25 years of suffering from 4 mental health conditions and being a gamer for 20 of those years I've never had any urge to reenact anything I've seen in video games, movies, books, TV shows, etc. so while a mental health illnesses are a quick and easy excuse for real life crimes it's ultimately down to the people who commit the crimes and their decision to go through with them.
After all if, hypothetically speaking, I go ahead and buy a firearm and murder a few people I'd fully expect someone along the line to blame my mental health conditions for my actions when they instead should be thinking about how long to lock me up for. Again, that's just a hypothetical example since I'd never even hold a knife to up someone in jest and that in itself should explain that you can't just blame someone's health, mental or physical, for their actions.
Bottom line is that video games only influence people in a very slight way and people who are unlucky enough to be easily influenced in real life by video games shouldn't be playing them in the first place."
25212,Kim!
25213,ethnic cleansing should of been incuded
25214,"to the persons involved in all these controversies whether they be clueless activists' people too lazy to look after their own psychotic children or self absorbed politicians who have no clue as to how the real world works i say to these scum-bags ""fucking grow up"". most books and even the bible are more violent than the worst video games on the market. heck even most horror films are worse than video game violence. once again political correctness strikes again. the two words that don't fit more than any other pair of words. if some nut job decides to go nuts with a gun at a school then that's the fault of the authorities who did not think to bring that individual in for psychiatric treatment as is the parent(s) who stupidly thought they could look after such a fucking screw-ball by themselves. common sense does not exist any more as the typical middle class moron takes over when it comes to running whatever country they live in. i implore everyone who reads this comment to fight against political correctness for the sake of your country or else these fuck-wits will destroy the country you call home with total nonsensical words and self absorbed comments."
25215,"06:20 ""CoD is realistic??......... hahahahhahahahahahahashha
Currently rolling on the floor laugghing my ass off
Clearly these dumbass reporter's never play these vid game's before running their mouth off about them although I dont mind them bashing CoD cuz frankly that franchise is a steaming pile of horseshit."
25216,Top 10 top10watchmojo videos
25217,Fuck it just play games no life
25218,FINISH HIM! Ed Boon is the master.
25219,"Playing violent games does not make people violent, not letting them play video games will make them pretty fucking violent."
25220,"can we just point out that fox news was the news source that was in half of the clips, and also was one of the first cable news networks to start there war on video games"
25221,3:45 Kim!!!
25222,"OK, number three is just screwed the hell up. and the whole concept of Manhunt is horrible."
25223,AngryJoe's annual top 10 video game controversies lists are amazing and captivating. Much better than this soundbite watchmojo shit.
25224,"Number 1 is true, why would someone just blame a shooter for them using real guns? Seriously, they don't look at ANYTHING, they just think that games are to blame. They have no evidence what so ever to say that they played ""video games"" or even if playing games, shooter games. They just have this one topic they can blame on because it was the case in about 3 cases, but now its like everything is to blame on video games."
25225,i love video games! but if i wanted to go out now and kill someone it would be from anger or revenge! it wouldnt be from the video games! since ive started playing video games i havent changed! all it does if free you from the real world!
25226,The US seems to be the only nation that actually is bothered by these games.
25227,"Games dont make me mad or angry, infact it is the opposite. Games calm me down. If anything makes me mad its these damn news reports!"
25228,One video game controversy was when magnovox lawsuited Atari about PONG.
25229,"Number #4 is fucking Bullshit I understand that they didn't want people to disrespect the soliders who died or wounded in the battle....
But get over it its just another video game."
25230,I wonder why parents blame the companies for violent video games it's their damn job to read the rating lvl of the game....
25231,"Are the American Government just stupid they tend to blame (games, music, films) for their own fault like most people that kill after doing one of the above happen to be mentally unstable anyway, One more is people are not stupid they don't take on what they see normally. As I has played games all life and had no effect on me or my friends that happen to be the same it is something for a government to blame as it will be shown as their fault if they don't move the blame on something else."
25232,They all piss me off.
25233,what about Hitman???
25234,"For the 6 days in Falluja i dont fully understand why they pulle dit, what its okay to make a movie about wars, but not a game? its basicaly the same thing and what ive discovered is that i know more about what i love from video games then i do from research."
25235,I played No Russian and I gleefully gunned down people because I knew their lives weren't real they didn't have families or jobs or lives it's the sickos who pretend they do that we should berate not the games
25236,"My church didn't care about Pokemon, heck they gave pokemon toys out time to time when they did these bring a friend to church Sunday. The good ol days of being a kid and Sunday school."
25237,"well dont hate the game, hate the player. call of duty itself doesnt cause behavioral issues. its the community who does. i played black ops 2 and in a handful of games i got kids raging and people with their ego so high they think they're better than everyone. oh and lets say i play a lot of dynasty warriors and then for some random reason i go on a mass shooting. on my games collection i have a lot of dynasty warriors and final fantasy and devil may cry games and only one fps game. they see my collection and immediately points out the fps game. PEOPLE ARE SO BIASED!"
25238,The 1st Person Shooter one pissed me off so much! All you hear if News reporters bitch about how shooting games are linked to the Sandy Hook shooting! Scientists have proved that Video Games help people react quicker in those situations. Also the reason we have so many shootings is because the News Reporters bitch bitch and bitch about shootings for five years! This makes Psychos think that killing people makes them famous!
25239,"Whevever a game comes out, somebody finds something to bitch about. I remember how stupid Fox news is every time a violent game comes out. There was violence before then, and there will be violence after this. If anything, games like Grand Theft Auto can act like stress relief for me, rather than planning murder. Plus too, most videogames are not completely realistic when it comes to shooters. Plus, a gun is harder to handle in real life than in a videogame and I can tell you that for sure. And why do people friek out when a game like GTA does something controversial? The torture scene in the most recent game, I found it to be an inteligent sattire. It made me uncomfortable, but that was what they were trying to do. When you take a step back and think that this actually happens in real life, you loose a little bit of faith in humanity, and it shows you how ugly the world really is. Media tries to sugarcoat shit all the time in movies and videogames, and it needs to stop, and everybody at Fox news needs to remove the sticks out of their asses and get real jobs."
25240,"I don't mind people blabbering about violent video games making violent people (it really doesn't, just the naive, mentally sick, and gullible ones) but I hate it when they don't mention movies, TV shows, or books. I have read some completely twisted, violent books and I've seen movies that would put silent hill, GTA, and call of duty on their knees (SAW comes to mind). TV shows are a little less violent, but that doesn't stop producers from pushing the limit (child deaths, torture, rape, etc). These people need to get lives and wake up. If you don't like the movie, game, tv show, etc, just don't watch/play it, return it for a refund. Stop messing with the lives of others who are competent enough to enjoy these things for what they really are: entertainment!"
25241,"I'm 15 and play video games like GTA,Mass Effect., Skyrim, Saints Row, CoD..Oh looks like I have to go out and mass murder people.. I mean come one..that's ridiculous"
25242,"It s been like that for centuries. When radio was born, people said it was because of it there was violence, when TV came up, it was it that caused violence, when super hero comic books came up, it was it that caused violence, other genres of music came up, it was them that caused violence, so on & so on...
Then video games came up, & since then, media, religion, conservative groups, government, parents, you name it, have been blaming them for all that is evil, wrong, satanic (!) & immoral in the world! Here s the thing, from year to year, everybody will just find something to blame, when the 1s to blame are WE, the humans. There s a shootout at a random school, it wasn t video games, it s something called PARENTING, wich, these days, is something that nobody seems to point out.
These controversies are completely useless, for example PETA VS Pokemon, yes the game showcases super powered animals fighting each other for, uh, fun. But it s not just that, when you win an important battle you just ( at least with me) want to hug your Pokemon for the amazing job they did. That s what they forget, there s more than just fighting, there s also love in it, don t you sometimes wish your Pokemon were real so you could play with them?
So why don t these A-holes don t get a bit of an open mind & start seeing beyond the violence, beyond the killing, beyond the sexism ( Mass Effect, wich I don t understand the controversy in romancing with ither characters) & just stop with this madness. Also, I would like to ask the australian government to be more receotive towards games, studies confirm that violence IRL & video games don t match, after all studies are used for something."
25243,I like the woman in the end of the video
25244,"Ritalin...Adderall...there's your mental illness! Everyone wants to point the finger, but no one wants to look in the mirror."
25245,"I hated the case in which a 5 or 6 year old shot his nanny. everyone blamed video games but I was thinking,
1, why was there a loaded gun
2,, why didn't he know gun safety
3, why was a 6 year old playing GTA
4, why did these parents fail at being parents?"
25246,"Test your might.
Test your might."
25247,the mass shootings one is all too true. someone shot somebody lets blame it on video games
25248,I read all the comments
25249,Wow are you kidding me?
25250,6:08 Modern warfare 2 realistic.. Definitely Bullshit.
25251,People love to bitch about video games.
25252,White culture is satan...tv your movies...everything...you got cops beating killing for no reason...your government is filled with pychos...but dont worry...the animals will be put down. Your terror across the world...will end in a bang...and idiots will still point fingers at others...and never themselves.
25253,Video games.dont turn u into killers crazy people turn into killers
25254,"I'm suprised Max Payne 3 never got on the headlines of news stations, that game was violent as fuck."
25255,"Lol the mass effect one pissed me off, you can choose to be a girl. And the girl can choose to have sex with anyone."
25256,These people don't no what there talking about people with big egos blame some thing or some one because they don't want to Amit it
25257,That's why I hate FUCKS news!
25258,"Harvester, Postal"
25259,I think I am going to help develop 6 days in Fallujah justto piss offall those butthurt assholes.
25260,one thing i must say THERE GAMES games you the thing u play for FUN heard of it news people 2nd why do you care at all what i do in my home i dont hear people cursing in real life to be baned beacuse they can do it and if video games ever got banded i just dont know.... 3rd why the heck are they guys talking about games any way they dont even play them or even worst they do but only talk about it so they get paid [rembers to breath] sometimes i wonder what going on in people heads when they see someone playing a video game
25261,Oh... How I hate the media.
25262,What about Binding of Isaac and Wrath of the lamb.
25263,how is this stuff a big problem there just games there not real and the only reason we play them is for entertainment and the more realistic it is the better.
25264,They should really have games rated by..y'know GAMERS
25265,i have mass efet on minecraft 360 on XBOT 360 its a texer pack
25266,i hate when people attack videogames because they dont wanna blame the fact that the kid was bullied or negelected at home also i rlly dont like that they are trying to end my future profession and its rediculous its like if video games cause violance then spoons cause people to over eat ya know
25267,"1:10 ""It's man deciding how many women he wants to be with.""
...so what's the problem? (unless you are a feminist and believes the decisions should be all left to the woman?)"
25268,i tink its stupid that people blame video games for crimes because its just a bit of fun and if you dont like your child playing that game because it might have an influence on them don bu them the game in the first place
25269,i think it's great that PETA love animals and everything but sometimes they're just arseholes. Like for example saying pokemon encourages animal abuse' or that mario should be banned due to his raccoon suit...
25270,I can't even watch this... Damn press.
25271,Why are they blaming it on the videogames? WTF!!
25272,The entire thing where people think Vid games cause school shootings is bs cause ive been playing games for over 10 years and not once have I thought hey ima go shoot up my school not once..... And I wish Pokmon would teach me magic!
25273,"screw fox news! if the logic is if someones kid died in black hawk down, then it wouldn't be in theaters, or platoon?"
25274,If shooters make you want to shoot other people like in the game why doesn`t the sport games make you want to do sports.
25275,"A game getting dropped because of anti-war protesters really fucking annoys me, oversensitive intefering pricks. Also I'm not a fan of CoD but I'm still glad they made that no russian level and shocked those dickheads in the media."
25276,"Controversies about video games are stupid, even chess is violent game, because simulate a battle where every pieces represents entire battalion. When player take pawn, he kills between 300-1000 men"
25277,The government cries oh he pulled someone's tooth out and hit him we'll lets see the us government give around 3 million to the CIA for quote obtaining information that is basically ripping someone's tooth out but I'm srry the CIA does much worse things MUCH WORSE things
25278,*any
25279,And one that thinks Pokemon is evil is stupid as fuck.
25280,"i think those fucking people needs to worry about shit in there time not ours, i probably didnt make sense lol"
25281,The Pokemon controversy annoys me the most because I've been playing the games since I was 7 years old and I love animals and would never want to hurt them!
25282,...
25283,"""OMG THE SHOOTER LIKED VIDEO GAMES! HE LIKED VIDEO GAMES!""
Yeah...well so does the majority of the FUCKING WORLD"
25284,Video games don't make people violent.. People make people violent
25285,Pokemon is what!?...... SATANIC!!??? .. Human stupidity is infinite!
25286,"a month ago, these consoles never existed, now there everywhere. training kids. doing things that would make the roughest guys in the corps puke. (this is a quote from a fictional book, so dont QQ too hard.)"
25287,8:39 Straight Truf
25288,"i thing the stupidest thing on here, was that pokemon ""introduces children to witchcraft, and how to cast spells""... DAFUQ?? i have played pokemon since the original red and blue and have never once seen any witchcraft or spells. and those people in the audience accepting it like it was straight out of the bible, just nodding along. that is complete bullshit."
25289,people who work at news channels just despise video games and find want to anyway possible to blame something on video games
25290,"During the massacre in CoD, I didn't shoot anybody..."
25291,"We have far too many stupid people in this world. Ironically, most of them are political and/or are involved in the media."
25292,"I have manhunt 2, most of the grand theft autos, Call of duties, Postal, etc. I am such a fucked up person. I can feel the evil coursing through my veins!!! I have the sudden urge to eat a puppy!!!! DSADNASNJAFJNJN!!!!!!!!!!!"
25293,How many times has night trap been in a top ten?
25294,Counter Strike being banned in multiple countries was pretty ridiculous.
25295,"All claims of Pokemon being satanic/racist/abusive to animals are completely Ridiculous, just like the fact that the people making those claims actually existed."
25296,"all those parents that complain about violence in video games should just have a long talk with their kids on the subject of what's real and what isn't. also the whole way of living in most families leads to the kid being left in his/her room with a whole bunch of games and consoles... and his/her parents not giving a (excuse me for the saying) fuck. dear parents,
 next time you want to blame video games for psichological tendencies in your children, think about what you've done about it. oh, and there's an age rating on the box of every game.read that before stating quote unquote ""GTA isn't suitable for children!"". it damn wasn't supposed to be. The fact that you bought it for your five y-o brat doesn't mean that he/she was the intended audience.
 and now to the gaming community: we should all ignore ( to where possible) the media on the subject, because they're just filling air time. P.S.:if you've read this so far, thank you and sorry for the long post :)"
25297,"Games don't make people crazy, crazy people just play games to practice for their real life attacks or it just brings their below the surface psychological problems to the surface."
25298,"Banned in Australia? You mean everything?
That should've been #1. Seriously, everything potentially fun is banned. I've got a friend who's so out of the loop with games that he's like a modern day nerd, playing on a gameboy instead of a ps4. Poor guy can't play anything good without it being banned in some way."
25299,"I hate when some psycho goes out and kills a bunch of people and the media tries to humanize said individual.
It's not in our nature to want to take a life, it's extremely difficult, even for people in the military. Anyone that thinks taking a life can be influenced by any source of entertainment, or by any object is wrong, it doesn't matter that the person is unsociable, or that he/she plays violent video games, there is no reason for stealing someone's life for no purpose.
Every time there's a killer or a terrorist news stories always say something stupid like: ""He was always the quiet one,"" or ""I knew him for years he could never do that!"" These people clearly didn't know this individual well enough to know that he was a complete god damn lunatic, and I honestly wish that the people that can just take someone's life for fun just go to jail, be locked up 24/7, and be kept alive by machines. Literally locking them inside their bodies and being able to think but without being able to move."
25300,6:20 Did he just say CoD was realistic? Dumb politicians...
25301,"why shit like that only happens only in usa even though people in Europe, Asia, and Canada play video games too, butdont go around shooting kids in their schools."
25302,"It's funny how they took the gta 5 torture scene so serious. There was a torture scene in far cry 3 against your own brother and no one gave a shit. But sure, it was not as bad."
25303,NUMBER 1 Half Life 3
25304,Really no Warz?
25305,Mental illness is a big problem for the online community as well. Makes playing most games online unpleasant.
25306,"Lets kill all Fox News Reporters, kay?"
25307,im still pissed ^ Days in Fallujah was cancelled. People lost kids on D-Day and i didnt see any controversy when movies were made about it
25308,I hate people who take games too seriously.
25309,"That No Russian level WAS pretty chilling, but for the love of glob, just...remember that you're totally capable of suspending OR restoring your disbelief and hey! It's a game!"
25310,well it is fox thought
25311,"""Violent video games are the cause of all violence. Take Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto off of store shelves before another mass shooting happens!""
""Sounds like a reasonable argument, but only to those who have never heard of mental illnesses""
""No mental illness could cause these things!""
""Are you sure that Antisocial Personality Disorder couldn't cause it? My kids play those video games, and they wouldn't hurt a fly.""
Don't you just love it when morons blame video games for real life violence?"
25312,really if a game is gonna make you go out and kill people then why are you blaming the ones who made the game and not the one who killed people the is not making them they are messed up already they shouldn't be aloud to play games like that so why complain if you dont like the game dont play it
25313,"Saying ""He liked first person shooter games which could have led to the shooting"" is like saying, ""He liked apple pie which could have led to the shooting"". Millions of people love fps games, it is nowhere near a passable argument as to why people feel the need to start mass shootings."
25314,Saw 2 flesh and blood
25315,Manhunt
25316,Good to know that we don't care about helping people with diagnosed mental issues as long as entertainment can be blamed instead!
25317,POSTAL! Postal! POOSTAL!!!
25318,Yup I played beat replayed and loved POSTAL 2 I guess this means i need to shove a gun up a cats ass and start killing people riiiiiiiiiiiight? Oh wait this is reality.... not media bullshit fantasy land ^_^
25319,"Although I don't really consider myself a conservative anymore, even back when I was one I never understood why they seemed to hate video games so much. It was really annoying because I felt like I was one of only a few conservatives defending video games."
25320,Oh wow the person who shot up a place played a video game. There's an escape goat for everybody to fucking blame our countries violence on. That is shit.
25321,"Video game ""controversies"" are a joke. It's always some disgruntled parent complaining about what society is shoving at their kids. Don't like violent video games? Then don't BUY them! Parents are just being stupid and lazy, they have complete control over what their children watch and play with! Does a friend of your child own a video game you don't want them playing? Alert their parents, or keep your child from going to their house! And if, when they're older they choose to play those kinds of games, then that's their own decision. It's not rocket science people."
25322,"We've been over this. Guns don't kill people. PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE. A gun is not a necessary instrument to take a person's life. When someone gets strangled, do we try and outlaw rope? NO. It's utterly ridiculous. Video games most definitely don't kill people."
25323,...Because trusting everything Fox News says is a smart choice...
25324,Did you know playing half life 2 can help your vision?......IT CAN
25325,IDIOTS!!! First off games can be just as helpful than anger management and dont show shit that makes fun of or at all shows a certain gender being more dominate. The girls in games are just as helpful than most of the male characters!!!
25326,The last one is the one I hate most. No matter where it is when there is a mass shooting is always gets blamed on video games. Like really come on? Whats next are they gonna blame beinga dictaor on video games as well?
25327,These people make a huge deal about video games...But when these same people go watch watch Hollywood movies with similar types of sex and violence they gobble it up like fuckin candy!
25328,video game controversies mostly on fox news. anyone else surprised?
25329,What's the game at 8:33? (and thanks in advance).
25330,"Look at me no Russian is my favorite mission, Mario inspired me to do drugs, I want to rob banks , I want to kill all the gods, I want to destroy a planet with energy blast, I thought manhunt was entertaining and beautiful. But anyways it's the parents fault if your son/daughter is a killer. And I agree with that guy said if sport games don't make you champions then why do shooters make you a killer?"
25331,"I was really pissed when I saw something on FOX News about Mad World, that was literally my favorite game on the Wii"
25332,Cough 9/11 Handheld Cough
25333,"i hate it when people say video games cause violence but guess what i have been playing since i could hold a controller and i don't think about murdering people. It mainly happens because parents don't show their kid rights and wrongs, or some people are sick in the head. Leave gamers/games out of this."
25334,No Russian in CoD Modern Warfare 2 actually is the first thing in videogames to make me feel truly uncomfortable
25335,there
25336,tere all fucking games people need to calm there tities
25337,Why do the press gotta exaggerate on every fps game. I know some of them were bad but some were just stupid.
25338,people like to bitch about everything especialy things that arent real!
25339,I don't like how the parents blame the game um... no it's your fault because you bought the game for your kids. You  can't blame call of duty for making  your 12 year old go crazy it's your fault because you ignored the rating that says 17 and  up. They just play the blame game because they don't want to take responsibility for what's going on
25340,3:24 Game name? OuO
25341,"James Holmes, Devin Moore, Aaron Alexis and Adam Lanza, as well as many other killers, had mental illnesses prior to committing the crime. It pisses me off that this is still a topic for debate."
25342,"I wish that the media would stop talking about things they know nothing about. The fact that they keep saying ""It's very realistic"" just proves my point."
25343,"I love how all the complaints about these video games had one thing in common, Fox News. 
It just proves my point on how ridiculously biased and offensive the Fox News can be. It's a channel dedicated to belittle and criticize anything not related to Jesus. Just the other day, I saw a video from Fox News that ridiculed an Atheist for speaking for what he believed and was kicked off the show. You can find it if you type ""Atheist Kicked off Fox News"" on Google.
This is not me saying that all of these movies are moralistic pure or age-appropriate. I perfectly understand and sympathize that games like ""6 days in Fallulah"" and 'Manhunt' should be banned.
But banning 'Pokemon'? Are you serious? Should we start banning 'Spyros' or 'My little Pony'? Doesn't those games scream out demonic natures? 
Fox News, you have to stop being so sensitive. We play games to experience the inexperience-able, to let off steam, and Heaven forbids, to have some fun."
25344,"Jynx was not making fun of black face it was making fun of Japanese fashion that was popular at the time among teens. NOBODY IN JAPAN HAS A FUCKING CLUE AS TO WHAT BLACK FACE IS OR WHY IT IS OFFENSIVE, THE UNITED STATES IS NOT THE CENTER OF THE WORLD.
I would've liked to have played Six Days in Fallujah.
in No Russian you didn't have to shoot anyone you could just walk. But shooting innocent civilians is just so much fun (helloNSA people who are now watching my account)
the main thing is people need to stop being so damn sensitive. It isn't damaging to live around violence because until recently (within the past 200 years) if you HADN'T seen someone die in front of you then you were part of a very small minority. anyone remember public hangings? or how about the fact that in many cultures until recently when you were 13 you were old enough to get married and also serve as a soldier. humans are built on violence, we were created from violence and so we shouldn't try to be so protective of our children when it comes to violence. How are they supposed to learn that violence is bad if they don't see what the outcome is? How can a child fear an abstract concept that they have no knowledge of?"
25345,"people in the media act as if violence never existed before video games, movies or heavy metal were around"
25346,liberal stations as well don't just put only conservative ones in
25347,"if fifa or NBA videogames don't make you a champion,why COD or gta must make you a killer?"
25348,"that's like saying, yeah were banning that book because someone gets killed and we don't want you to think like that..."
25349,al.l the contriversitys of a famous vg'
25350,It's so dumb how the media blames video games for people stuff do in real life.
25351,"for the record, petais fucking shit ass people"
25352,I really hate it when people think that there is a shooting somewhere and the kid plays shooters they automatically think that video are all the fault
25353,"Pokemon was accused of being satanic?
Yes and apparently people can snap their fingers and make food apear. Idiots."
25354,0:09 what game is this?
25355,Lol I'm an aussie
25356,"Uau, america is really full of brainless shit heads :|"
25357,those stupid bastards in the press just want attention so they just blame video games for everything because they only think that old people watch the news their can be some shooting or some other dumb shit like that and they can't understand that video games are fake not real people can kill over anything besides video games i think that all news people are just attention seeking dumbasses that can burn in hell
25358,"People who go on mass shootings who happen to like games like call of duty doesn't mean they were influenced to do acts like that. If somebody grows an illegal weed farm, that doesn't mean they got the idea from minecraft."
25359,"I've been playing GTA and first person shooter games my whole life and I have never developed a small feeling of kill someone else, these news channels are so shallow and look at the problem of psychological illnesses from a very weak perspective. It seems like American media pay more attention to video games than child sexual abuse that is very common there. Pathetic."
25360,I get even more violent because of the lagg than because of a game :p
25361,"You think it's hard on gamers when there's a mass shooting? Try being a gun owner. Liberals set their sights on law abiding gun owners when some psycho goes nuts and starts killing innocents. Yes it's a tragedy, is it a reason to attack people who have done nothing wrong? No."
25362,every body whent like omg in america when so many died and when it happens in norway almost nobody knows about it
25363,I like how people get mad at a form of entertainment
25364,Is it a cowiccadinc that almost all of the games are on fox newz? Oh fox so desperate to become a good channel.
25365,yea pokemon :P
25366,"Anyone remember the ""Punisher"" Game for Xbox? The beta version had torture sequences in full color, built into the game to extract information relevant to the progress of the game. However, in the final release, the torture sequences showed the ""death scenes"" fade to black and white, with the camera made to go slightly off kilter so you didn't see what was happening. I felt it was by far and away the most egregious example of censorship at the time. It was also the best depiction of the character of Punisher, better than all three incarnations of the Punisher in movies."
25367,Video Games are not blame. People who want to kill be people are insane. They were never disciplined and the parents are the people who's should be at fault. You don't just reload a giant machine gun by by clicking B or X. And when people blame Video Games they are blaming them all instead of one title. EVERY GAME. Like Mario Kirby link and pokemon. The media is a bunch of idiots and they gonna blame something they better have some fucking experience!
25368,I just bought manhunt 2 online so idk what your talking about. You can get in on gamers gate. Their awesome for old games
25369,FUCK FOX NEWS
25370,Aka 10 reasons why some people need to chill the fuck out and/or at least should not be allowed to speak since they clearly are too incompetent to do actual research and see why they are wrong.
25371,I hate how video games are to blame when it's the peoples fault.  There are mass shootings because people are fucked up. I bet that a kid who doesn't play games would be just as likely to shoot up a school if he was bullied.
25372,"I like how most of the media clips shown are from FOX because they can't leave well enough alone, and they have to give their opinion on something they know nothing about."
25373,"Some of the games are influential and ofensive , but not Call of Duty! Realy!?"
25374,"Media is to blame, again..."
25375,"something bad happened at one point, so . ALL FIGHTING GAMES, SHOOTING GAMES, ALL GAMES WITH BAD LANGUAGE, ANY FORM OF BLOOD, FAST PACED MUSIC AND ANYTHING WHICH COULD BE CONSTRUED AS FUN. in fact ALL KINDS OF MEDIA SHOULD BE BANNED OUTRIGHT.... I remember playing doom once.... which is probably the reason for all the bad things I've ever done to cats.
(that was a troll by the way)... the fact is.. media tend to make things worse than they really are..... not one ""journalist"" who claims these games are a bad thing has ever REALLY played them. also keep in mind.... they show worse shit on the morning NEWS ffs -.-"
25376,The Morning show! They don't blame it on the games...
25377,I've actually started to lose some faith in Fox... Still not as bad as the others but not great...
25378,Video games has a lot of violence that bases on the real world that make ppl think hmmm he did it now I'm gonna do it
25379,"I can understand the No Russian and 6 days in Fallujah, but seriously? Pokmon? And we see little 8 year olds on the Xbox all the time, like COD and Battlefield. Pokmon introduces animal abuse and witchcraft!
...
Seems Legit"
25380,there should be a game where every horrific act that humanity has done. from child sexual abuse to genocide. and everything after is just tame compared to it.
25381,#3 No Russian was by far my favorite level of any Call of Duty game!
25382,its funny how sensitive people in the media are
25383,My great grandpa is Catholic but im not so whenever I play pokemon around him he gives me this nasty look and tells me a Catholic story about how satan is evil and blah blah blah
25384,lol in 2011 gta V contoversey it was 2 years later for release seems legit
25385,"Do those morons know that FPS games like COD and Battlefield, I heard were used to treat some symptoms of PTSD in war vets."
25386,It's not the games fault for the kid going crazy. It's the parents.
25387,3:45 wasn't that Kim from the Yogscast?
25388,50 cent bulletproof when 50's friend got chopped in half by a chain saw.
25389,Where the fuck is the postal franchise?
25390,Amurica.... you know that we in Europe play a LOT of shooters and brutal games but we almost NEVER have shootings in schools. It is not fault of the games but youre just fucked up. Deal with it.
25391,"All hypocrites. ""Let's demonize the entertainment and praise the real thing"". They don't have anything to say about movies do they? Or how about killings and mass graves of real dead people with live and full coverage whenever they can market a skirmish for ratings? Oh, but let's not forget the overlooked ""it's ok if it's World War 2"" exemption that nobody had anything to say about when the first seven years of the previous decade was flooded with World War 2 games. You can't get anymore ""killing"" than World War 2. But I guess that's ok for ""concerned christian conservatives"" and their ""historical"" excuse."
25392,"that 3rd one was so fucking dumb people die in every fucking war and there have been games of those, that news lady was a bitch to take a shot at him like that, people are fucking stupid"
25393,Saints Row IV. It was just too much when they officially said that they hadn't even bothered with the storyline and that everything had been replaced with those redicilous animations.
25394,everyone expected #7
25395,I want to know why people think video games make you a violent person they have no proof soooo why do they think that
25396,God people are disgusting
25397,Videogames makes people into killers and terrorists... so Taliban and Al qaida have been playing Cod/BF?
25398,"a VIDEO GAME cannot desensitize someone to the point where they go on a killing spree, and if it does then there was obviously already something wrong with that person's psyche. I will admit that some video games are quite violent but that's all it is video game violence, there is a distinct difference between real life & games."
25399,"Not to surprised at any of these. Played each of these games and I do agree (to an extent) that some of those games were pretty damn graphic. However in every single case there should have been a parent or guardian in the lives of everyone to make sure they understand what is and isn't fiction.
Not a bad list though. However I felt Soldier of Fortune could've taken the 10 spot due to it being one of the first shooters in the late 90's to feature dismemberment and later on in the early 2000's mods were made by gaming communities for a major gore increase.
Good list once again though."
25400,I think we (gamers) should have are own people or system in place for deciding age limits and what game get banned.I bet at least 70% of people who complain have nether even played the game they are complaining about.
25401,I Sort of dont blame them for manhunt on wii
25402,7:43 Riley!
25403,every single one that everyone blames on video games like seriously people watch movies that are the exact same
25404,the people that commented the games pissed me because they are little fucking pricks who dont uderstand anything
25405,Manhunt 2 isn't banned because i didnt buy it.i downloaded it
25406,Blaming video is just an exuse!
25407,"Oh my god, white people controversies!!!!"
25408,"Most people with mental health issues play FPS games because in a way they are killing the person who bullied them.
I play cause its fun it doesn't make me want to go out and massacre a lot of people for playing a violent game that would just be silly.
Parents these days seem to have no control over their children and that's because they were either teen parents or where given no morals when growing up to pass onto their children so they run a havoc, too much reports on the news blaming video gaming companies jeez, look at yourself parents it is your own fault for raising a stupid kid"
25409,Murica
25410,OH MY GOD. You fucking people (the mass media and people getting offended by a game plot) need to chill the hell out it's just a game!
25411,Mainstream media pisses me off
25412,"I remember when Medal of Honor came out and all the mothers who have lost their sons, husbands etc. were getting mad because players could play as the Taliban."
25413,0:01
25414,"I think ur perfectly right, defiantly everyone blaming video games for people being shop etc... i mean who allows guns in their country and doesn't expect a murder now and again as insensitive as that sounds its true"
25415,Australia Sux When It Comes To Games
25416,People play 1st person shooters in Britain nobody has gone on a shooting spree but in America they have there is only one difference in America you can buy guns from shops in Britain you can't so go fuck your self Fox News
25417,I hate fucking stupid news sources who think a fictional game is the cause for mass killings and shit.
25418,Fox News really knows how to exaggerate everything
25419,"It's obvirus that GTA, Manhunt and MW2 would be on here but I'm surprised that Madworld for the Wii didn't appear. Plus I think that talking about the sex scenes in mass effect on the national news will just encourage more dirty perverts (myself included) to buy the game for this."
25420,"US Government: So to stop violent massacres we have a choice of what we should ban.
1. Guns - Have been used to murder people for hundreds of years and are far too easy to gain access to due to our ridiculous laws.
or
2. Video Games - Where no direct link has ever been proven between playing them and being involved in a mass murder, and at the end of the day they are a fucking GAME!
Answer - Video Games, DUH! We'd better teach these Gaming companies a lesson! Now where's my pistol..."
25421,"Plus I played games that are for 18& up yet there are kids 5 6 maybe even younger playing that shit. If you want to blam anyone blame the parents for letting their kids play the games. When I was little it took forever for my mom to let me play MK on saga but tbh its one of my favorite old games. 
But guess what as you can tell I'm not in jail for killing people I'm to much of a puss to even really talk to anyone. Yet I'm not killing people or animals . know why? Cause my parents raised me right. Not give me a $500 system & $100+ games so I'd stay out of their hair.
I didn't even know what an Xbox was till I was almost 17 I'm almost 21 now. I still had/have my gamecube.. I only know about Xbox cause my dad asked if I wanted one that's sad cause he's not really up to date on stuff now a day's lest back then still a bit now. But still. 
People just need something to blame it on so they blame video games.. Blame parents &/or other people not video games.
Like my mom always told me ""you mad not have started the fight, but you're gonna end it"""
25422,"World of Warcraft: ""Real Name"", Zul Gurub virus event etc."
25423,"People are just jealous so they try to blame everything else for how shitty their life is & what not on other things & probably pissed that something they think is stupid is making more money then they ever will & didn't think of it & all that good crap.
Video games don't make a bad person if anything keeps that person from being a killer it's people who make killers not games."
25424,"im from australia and it is here and is rated and ca be bought from most shops, some mad facts right here"
25425,"A parent once blamed Minecraft for his 8 year old son bringing a knife, gun, and sledgehammer to school. He claimed in the game thatthey use sledgehammers to dig into the ground, and use guns and knives to fight the monsters in it. Seriously? I think it's an excuse because he left his gun laying around."
25426,"Alright ready for a long comment? well first off, video games are meant for fun. Im from australia and even i think the laws are squishy. Video games ARE addictive but who the fuck cares? everything is jesus christ and also to that bitch saying stuff about womens rights and stuff dont we have enough of that? the reason we have women as robots that we control is cus most of the people who play xbox dont go out and talk to women video game companies are geniuses few people who play GTA actually have killed people and the people that do are fucked in the head. THANKS"
25427,GTA and COD are the dumbest games that have ever existed.
25428,"If you can tell the difference between reality and fantasy, than video games can't make you a killer. It's okay to kill people in video games, because, shocker, it isn't real and you wouldn't (hopefully) kill people in real life.
And in most games you're the hero trying to stop the bad guys/monsters/murderers anyway. Doom is satanic? You're trying to kill demons and save the world."
25429,"Video games make people violent? I say me not having my video games, IS MAKING ME PRETTY FUCKING VIOLENT!"
25430,fox news sure popped up a lot in this video huh
25431,"I'm a conservative and I truly cannot understand why the conservative media goes bonkers when they see violence in a game. The whole point of violent video games is to allow people to do in the gamewhat they know they can't do in real life.
Like R. Lee Ermey (Retired U.S. Marine) said if someone can't tell the difference between a game and real life they need help, get them a doctor."
25432,LOl kim
25433,Video games are the US' scapegoat for their horrible gun laws lol
25434,If the government would look at mental illness before letting that person buy a gun less shit would happen
25435,lets see which pissed me off the most all of them
25436,Media: Someone went on a mass shooting! GASP! He has grand theft auto! That must have been the reason!
25437,i dont understand its just a video game it doesnt cause murder
25438,i dont see why everyone wont just leave video games alone so fuck you fox news
25439,I would like to mention the controversy that surrounded Dante's Inferno when it first came out. People were protesting in mass groups complaining about how graphic the game was and how the player is literally ripping through hell.
25440,"What a joke. I've been playing video games for almost 25 years and not once have I wanted to inflict personal harm to anyone because of it. The people playing these games already had mental illness to begin with. If anything, video games are such good stress relief for people, it probably PREVENTS people from snapping from the insanities of the real world. Everyone's looking for someone or something to blame when all they got to do is simply look into a fucking mirror and realize its only them."
25441,I want a new manhunt for next-gen!
25442,games don't make ppl kill ppl kll people cuz there insane
25443,I say fuck off government the odds of death by murder are at anall timelowest andvideo games have beenproven NOTto cause violence and by all time I mean going back sentries
25444,I remember my 6th grade teacher was an evangelist or whatever and she was always telling us how pokemon was diabolical and shit lol
25445,"The developers create games so that what people actually want to do can just do it in a game. If anything, games keep people from killing cause they spend their time ON THE GAMES. Which are apparently the problem? Maybe media should stop worrying about stupid little shit and focus on you know...maybe the problems in the country? I swear....this day in age the human population that isn't involved in some sort of government is completely speechless because protest means nothing anymore and it makes completely no sense. There is a law written by John Locke stating that if the government were to become corrupt in the eyes of the society which created it hence us, the people, could take back the power and redistribute it. Yeah.....I'd like to see that happen......more like government controls us like animals and attacks us cause they like money."
25446,at least the news doesnt really affect the industry. theyre still pumping out gta5 type games
25447,COD MW2 no russian wasnt bad stupid media. it was awesome to kill a bunch of russians.
25448,"People just get to annoyed with games, then other gamers have to suffer. The games should be allowed but have things like, ""enter at own risk"" something like that. NO ONE LIKES POLITICS!"
25449,"I see video games as a way 2 express yourself no matter what its about, if your mad play games where you shoot stuff and let some steam off from the blood splatter, if your sad play some goofy ass games to laugh your ass off, if your happy be yourself and do what you, if your tired and need a good wake up call play some scary ass games thats how i see it."
25450,fuck you adults
25451,what the fuck.. Pokemon is satanic?? Are you fucking serious!? Im loss for words..that guy needs to get a slap and come back to reality lool I'm not even a pokemon fan but that stupidity just pissed me off.
25452,"What about just ban Fox News instead of banningevery ""controversy""?"
25453,"Sony payed all of the people back who lost money. It took the two groups five years to hack psn. Not only that, but xbox live gets hacked many times a day sometimes and they don't do anything to reimburse their customers. I hate it when the media and people criticize companies like Sony, because it took two highly advance hack teams to by luck hack them before they updated their system and forced them to start all over again, yet other companies have it way worse like microsoft and don't do anything to support their fans. And it can take an amature to hack the xbox compared to what it takes to hack Sony's networks. It was incredibly difficult to hack psn. It took them five years to do it running codes on computers 24/7."
25454,Humanity makes me wanna kill people.
25455,People can't blame fps shooter games! We are kids and have THEY ever played??? I'm guessing no! The insane kids who play and kill are not us! We use this as a way to get stress out! Annoying people who just try to blame someone or something. ASSHOLES!!!!!
25456,"I do have a serious problem with MW2. If you ever been shot at by full auto weapon its not cool. The point of the game is combat and the game play could had been made into a simple cut scene and then gave you control when the combating enemies showed up. Fuck activision for that one. There is allot i would want to be through a video game but not a punk ass, bitch ass, evil ass Terrorist that shoots an air port up. They want to be edgy and realistic, then put children in it......yeah I thought so. Sick ass game devs."
25457,"Guns don't kill people, apparently video games do."
25458,Over reaction alert
25459,"The thing about the whole ""HURRR VIDEO GAMES CAUSE VIOLENCE"" idea is that, honestly, more people in the world watch/read the news (which normally puts a focus on the murderer/killer than the victim/victims) than play video games. So, by that logic. If you have watched the news, you are probably 100,000x more likelier to shoot up a school than a person who plays video games, if you watch the news."
25460,"More than ever, I feel the need to browse eBay =P"
25461,No mention of Rapelay?
25462,Michael Atkinson is my uncle... :/

25467,"Lol ~
I can't stop thinking about a game named ""Bully"" ~"
25468,The games don't kill people the guns don't kill people the people kill the damn people
25469,"I hated the controversy on Resident Evil 5. The game took place in Africa, so of course the vast majority of the infected were black people. This, somehow, encouraged genocide against black people. What. The. Fuck"
25470,"Usually conservative news media? I'll take ""Confirmation Bias"" for $400, Alex. Not sure why you chose to throw that in there when you normally see liberal news sources like MSNBC get up in arms (ironically) over intensifying gun regulation in the US to combat ""video game influenced violence""."
25471,Would the media think the same about games if 9/11 never happened?
25472,"By far the stupidest controversy I can remember is the one over the ""obscene content"" in Oblivion, because someone created a mod that made all the NPCs naked. Talk about clueless media types."
25473,Its fox. What do you honestly expect?
25474,"I found #3 sickening, myself."
25475,Do parents even read the ESRB?
25476,Moral of the story: Fuck Fox News
25477,games dose not make a killer they have mental illness's video game let kids do their sadistic deed there so they can function in society and lead happy and healthy lives
25478,"The link between young people and mass shootings in america isnt video games, the link is how easy it is for people to get a gun and how insane the person is to do something like that"
25479,"""Cooper, have you ever played Mass Effect?""
""NO!""
Cue epic facepalm.
Mortal Kombat 9 was considered so bad Australia had boarder security trying to prevent the game from being imported in. Now if only they did that with people smugglers.
With Saints Row it was the drugs in Shaundi's mission that really set the Australian censors off. Murder is fine, rape is fine, crime simulation is fine, but if your game has drugs it's either banned or an automatic R rating.
Good picks but what about the Dead Island controversy? The infamous trailer took the gaming world by storm and certainly raised a few eyebrows. As did some code left in the game that suggests Techland don't think much of women. The trailer for Riptide was banned from Australian television for portraying suicide. And the Zombie Bait edition caused a stir for...well for lack of a delicate way to say it a woman's torso, just the torso. This would seem more controversial than Pokemon."
25480,Why is Fox News always involved?
25481,the major thing with modern warfare 2 in the no Russian mission is that they never tell you as the player to kill the civilians you assume you have to and that's why most people did fire upon them
25482,"Fox news is blatant propaganda, passing off lies and biased opinions as facts. I want to see fox news gone in my lifetime."
25483,All the FOX News!
25484,So much Fox news lol. Makes sense only idiots listen to them.
25485,"Listen, mentalillness, childhood, and Other factors create this crap, help these people to not kill, and we are better suited to have less horrific tragities."
25486,all storys about games piss me off
25487,Some people are so fucking stupid when it comes to Video Games.
25488,"What pisses me off the most is when the news blames video games such as call of duty or other first person shooters for many tragic incidents where people are killed in gun crime, the actions of a very few does not mean that because they have a copy of a certain video game that it is the source of their actions, GTA V won many awards for it's sales and millions of people have copies yet not everyone is killing innocent people in the street, the news always finds an easy way out!"
25489,Did anyone else notice that mostly fox news were covering these stories?
25490,"No seriously there was still violence before video games and the only reason someone would be influenced by a video game would be because the couldn't tell reality from a video game. I'm not being rude,,, but it's just that I lOVE my video games and all the characters but I do know they are not real and I can get that through my mind"
25491,SHUT UP YOU DONT KNOW A SEGL THEG ABAT POKEMON
25492,That myth that video games create violent murderers and criminals who play the games really depends on how impressionable the kid is. It's also the parents job to talk to their kids and clear things up to avoid them getting the impression that the actions depicted in the game are acceptable in real life.
25493,"Wow.
That's the local CBS station from Charlotte, NC.
I had no idea they ran with the ""Portal 2 makes fun of adoption story"". Don't remember it at all."
25494,"News organizations always love to point the finger at GTA. Even though in the new game, you can't bump into a pedestrian without a swat team running you over at high speed and shooting you multiple times. That game REEALLLYYY doesnt want you to hurt civilians."
25495,"tv , tv idiots everywhere"
25496,All of these controversies are just people over-reacting and not understanding the concept of the game so they make up abunch of bullshit.
25497,congress and the media likes to try to limit our freedoms. a massive of shooting always blame the video games used to be music before that movies before that elvis. the blames game never changes the only thing that does change in the blame game is what is blamed.
25498,autraslia seems to be bunch of pussies running their country. just like the u.s. is bunch f of pussies afraid of nudity on things.
25499,i think the realistic sex acts ever isn't in video games it sin real life just saying. plus fucking an alien is impossible to do since we don't have E.T.'s yet in our reality. so mass effet being realistic sex acts is completely bullshit.
25500,what was the game where the womans clothes disintegrated?
25501,A few of them were too graphic for me too watch like the GTA torture scene but I wouldn't stop anyone else from playing.
25502,"What kind of person becomes violent by playing violent videogames? A puppet? Are you telling gamers are puppets? Hey everyone! Those journalists are calling gamers puppets!
... Something like this to give those illiterate clowns a taste of their own medicine."
25503,"Don't forget guys, they're all just games."
25504,"There wouldn't be an issue here if parents would obey the ESRB ratings when buying games for their kids. That's why the rating was created, to keep games such as these out of kids' hands."
25505,ok ok people were pissed about 4 but not cod 1 which was sent in ww1
25506,"The States, So fucking backwards. Dur people are becoming violent because of videogames and shooting up the place. Let's monitor their videogames and purchases but not THEIR ACCESSIBILITY TO FUCKING AUTOMATIC FIREARMS FFS!!!"
25507,on number 3 no russian u r right it is affensive to some viewers but when it first comes on it does give u a warning about to some viewers this may seem affensive so they cant really accuse the game or the mission
25508,Jeez the media is just... stupid. But the lady at the end is the first person to not be a jackass on the news.
25509,"Bitch I haven't seen people walking around with more than fifty million dollars in their pants or pulling machine guns and rocket launchers out of their coats in my whole life, let alone learn the art of making cars fly and riding jet skis on land. I don't think imitating those in real life will be all that easy. -____-"
25510,Alien vs predator has really much goore
25511,"I think Britain should have a 'Mature' rating on ESRB instead of all this '18+' crap. Some kids have been taught right from wrong before they pick up a copy of GTA or Call of Duty and know that it would be unthinkable to replicate acts in the game in real life. There are people out there in their mid 20s, still failing to understand why mindless violence is wrong. As a 16 year old teenager, I can confess that I have never been part of a rape, airport shooting or murder anywhere in the world, partly because my parents showed me right from wrong, rather than let me do my own thing, unlike the parents of people responsible for school shootings, cinema massacres and crime overall, who clearly fail in disciplining them before spoiling them with copies of violent games. Maturity is learned, not something that comes with age."
25512,Ah we meet again Fox news
25513,FOX NEEEEEWWWWSSSSS!!!!
25514,What's the music in the background at the end?
25515,They need to get that stick out of their asses and look at all the facts
25516,"if video games effected us this much, then why aren't the adults running around in dark rooms hiding from ghosts and eating magic beans? (Pacman)"
25517,"i hate when video games get blamed for mass shootings, they get blamed almost every time but do you know what caused the first school shooting? it was because the woman that did it said she hated monday's but did we blame Garfield or the song monday monday? no, clearly she was mental, so instead of focusing on what the person enjoyed to do in their free time news stations should focus on the actual person"
25518,"The problem is that the people in charge are too damn old for their job. They're living in a new world with an old world mind. A MASS KILLER PLAYED VIDEO GAMES? OH GOD THAT MUST BE IT. That means 90% of today's children are or will be mass murderers. It's like saying because a killer eats pizza, the pizza made him do it."
25519,Newsflash: Tetris blamed for mass genocide

25523,"I, and I'm sure a ton of other folks, would pay a pretty penny for an uncensored version of Manhunt, not to mention I'd buy a Wii. Why not create an ""Adults Only"" rating to appease little bitches and so we'd know which games to buy! I can spar with friends, and pretend to stab people all day. Why don't people blame paintball for murders? Idiots, always ignore science and even reality to spew their panic inducing drivel and nonsense agendas"
25524,"Maw sunn dawed, he ain't have no reset button! No fucking shit, he didn't die playing a video game, he enlisted in the army. Why the fuck do people still kowtow to these overly sensitive morons"

25526,Why must everything be banned in my country! Down with the Australian Rating System!
25527,"You have got to love the media mentality that guns and psychiatric problems kill
people but that it's video games that make people kill"
25528,I think some people should just grow a set of balls seriously who cares whats in a game!!

25533,"UHHHHHH THE MEDIA SAID MOVIES CAUSED SHOOTING, THEN MUSIC, THEN TV AND NOW GAMES"
25534,Gotta love how it's always fox news doing these reports.
25535,The Deus Ex 9/11 controversy was interesting but understandably left off because it wasn't nearly the problem as everything else here was.
25536,"WTF WHERE IN POKEMON IS THERE WITCHCRAFT?! There are Psychics and ghosts, but throughout all my years in playing I have NEVER seen witchcraft -_-"
25537,I find it funny how if someone is shot in real life they only thing to blame is a video game GAME not real!
25538,why odes the news blame video games come on.

25540,Conker's Bad Fur Day???
25541,"Its very hard to get this through the media's thick skull, Games dont kill people, people kill people. Murder has always been around, and there is always new ways to blame it on... But come the fuckety fuck fuck on guys! Thinking games like mw2 are realistic? R u fucking retarded? NOT EVEN ARMA IS REALISTIC ENOUGH TO BLAME MURDER ON! the cunts who blame murder on videogames have never fucking played them"
25542,"Hey, did anybody else realize that most of the controversies showed clip from Fox News? Just thought that was interesting."
25543,The GTA5 torture scene
25544,"you know the best part of the last bit, video games are now making guns that are not like any real ones because that would help not make you want to kill people."
25545,Some people can be complete idiots when only a handful of us are mentally crazy
25546,"Super Columbine Massacre RPG, 'nuff said"
25547,"I rather play a violent video game then watch the news. I mean seriously, a video is virtual and healthy people KNOW that, but the news, try explaining to your kid how there was a (trying not to offend anyone here) bombing or a school shooting, that's REAL. So I rather make my kid (if I had one,) go in the other room while I watch the news because its way harder to explain."
25548,The people thatthink video games are the main reason of shootings and murders are idiots
25549,"The press just loves to attack video games. They never goafter movies, books, or music nearly as much"
25550,Am I the only gamer who could care less about what those assholes think?
25551,Fucking Fox News
25552,People always blame video games because they need something to blame the world's crazy on and they have nothing else.
25553,"Oh, yes, hunting demons, things that are extremely dangerous, is satanic. BY that logic, cutting into a birthday cake while people stand in a circle and chant in the dark is satanic as well......"

25558,At the end of the fallujah story the news woman was being a total bitch
25559,Dear news: GO FUCK OFF AND JUST LOOK AT MOVIES AND TELEVISION WHILE YOU JUDGE VIDEO GAMES. It's even WORSE.
25560,"(After watching video)
Wow, slow Canadian news days are much nicer than slow American news days. Up here, the news casters just say, ""Let's go and look for a good samaritan and do a news story on him."" And as far as I've seen of American news, its just... look at 00:40.
Though to be honest, I've only seen a few clips from YouTube, so I cant really make a good judgement. Odd, though."
25561,There should be a list just for all the controversy GTA makes.
25562,"00:43
Jeez, that must've been a REALLY slow news day. Valve was making the characters joke about that to emphasize their personality, not to make fun of orphans. BAD NEWS CHANNEL! BAD!"
25563,5:27-5:31 the sounds tho
25564,Who laughs when people die in a war came stupid people have never even played those games how would they know anything
25565,I am offended by the images a collection of 1s and 0s make!!
25566,"I was not a fan of the 6 Days in Faluja stuff at all. People are okay with stories being retold in the form of books or movies, but not in games? Video games can be much more powerful because players are directly involved in the situations and have to make decisions as the situations are developing. If the project was developed properly it definitely would have raised positive awareness about the battle and could have put a real perspective on how terrible the operation was."
25567,HAHAHAHA COD... REALISTIC!? LOLOLOLOLOLOL
25568,Postal 2...
25569,Seriously how the hell do people think pokemon is evil i mean its just got a little electric rat in it so what
25570,"making videogames is an art and restricting them is just pathetic, those soc groups that do that are basicly doing the same thing that church was doing with science ages ago. If u think that game offends u just dont fcking play it, why do they push their pov on others ?"
25571,Lel
25572,I don't know if some of these people are just seeking attention or are really just idiots.
25573,The press is full of dickheads. End of story
25574,"Damn video games are the cause of massacres? I had no idea. Wait weren't like the middle ages in Europe extremely, uhm how do I say this, violent? Hell they had a war that lasted 114 years!!!! If they say violence stems from video games, then when did medieval europe invent video games?"
25575,If the powers that be start banning video games because they are violent then they better ban all horror movies. What's the difference?
25576,"If GTA Makes you a killer then....
Well, i don't think that Pong was invented in WW2..."
25577,"In the UK, we obviously have the age ratings also. The trouble is that most parents will ignore this and still buy an 8 year old Call of duty, because his friends will have it."
25578,i think that the Medal of honor Tier 1 game being banned from being sold on every military base in the US should have gotten a mention.
25579,"My number 1 is the ""pokemon is satanic""."
25580,"The admin of watchmojo.com is clearly a biased democrat supporter. 
I was expecting some cool facts, not your one sided opinions on how you just adore video games. 
Jist another butt hurt person. You just lost a like and a suscriber liberal. ;)"
25581,"First off before I say this I'm going to say that I am actually a conservative christian, now that I got that out of the way, I have to say that video games are not the cause of violence. There are M ratings on games for a reason, meaning you must be old enough to understand that what you are doing is in a game and not in real life. Although I do refuse to play games like GTA (I struggle playing games on where you are forced to be a bad guy), I know for a fact that it doesn't cause mass murders. Just because I have the balls to shoot someones head off in Fallout doesn't mean I'd have the balls to do it in real life. And same goes with owning firearms, just because I have a gun doesn't mean I am going to blow up a school. Murders and mass killings have been going on since man existed, and taking away our video games and guns won't change it. Oh and games with sex is also rated M for a reason, because older people already know that sex is a natural thing that most people do in their life...but of course it's rated M, meaning not for kids."
25582,No surprise Fox News is blaming mass shootings on violent video games instead of the weapons used and the mental state of the shooter
25583,"""[Mass Effect] allows players to engage in the most realistic sex acts ever conceived.""
No... games that would fall under that statement are any games by the Japanese company ""Illusion"""
25584,its your fucking fult if deside kill some one YOU FUCKS
25585,Payday: The Heist
25586,"When I hear religious leaders, political leaders, and News Anchors talk about how video games are bad and should be pulled from store shelves, to me it's like these same people are protesting a milton bradley game or a parker brothers game. oohhh you can't play Battleship because it teaches young children how to blow each other up, or you can't play candy land because it promotes fattening and unhealthy snacks....fuck you and your agenda"
25587,"Hi!
I just signed the petition ""Electronic Arts: Finish Production of Star Wars 1313"" on Change.org.
It's important. Will you sign it too? Here's the link:

Thanks copy and paste we need only 2000 more signatures were at 8000"
25588,"It isn't the fact that violent video games cause mass shootings. It can, but most of the time, parents can give violent video games to their irresponsible children. Secondly, wouldn't this violence partially be inherited by the parents. The dumbest problem within the controversy is that how these teens are able to get firearms. Does any weapons salesman realize how young their consumers are? Does the consumer have an ID to buy a weapon, and if they do, is it real? Parents should know if their children are responsible. It's partially the parent's fault for not setting their crack head of a child straight. Is it the video games? I'd say 10% of the time."
25589,Ugh I remember my aunt bitched at me when I was playing Red Dead Redemption because I skinned a bear. I swear it was ridiculous trying to explain to her that Ive never had and have any intention of killing and skinning bears. People just love to complain.
25590,3:25 What is this game? :P
25591,"I would have lived to have seen that game six days in fallujah. I don't understand why it was banned when call of duty, Medal of Honor and battlefield do the same thing but just change the names"
25592,That preacher talking about pokemon is a moron.
25593,Postal?
25594,"I like the comparison of video games with thoughts, like thoughts it's not a physical reality, it doesn't harm physically, there is a great diversity of themes, there is different views, there is an evolution, there is a certain liberty, there is confrontation, it's abstract, etc ....
Most of the time, person complaining about what there is in the video game, complains because the video game doesn't correspond to their own real life ""political"" agenda, so many examples i could give ...
Anyways, if you don't like some type of video game, don't play them ...
In real life, when you don't like somebody, well you don't frequent the person ...
Have a nice day."
25595,And top ten of evil corporations in science fiction?
25596,"Ugh friggin reporters and conservatives thinking they know everything, I'm tired of it. Video games do not just magically turn normal kids violent, when it comes to acts of violence, don't blame our games, blame the messed up players! I, as have several other people I know, have played M rated games long before wecould buy them without using IDs and we haven't become raging, gun-wielding, psychos!"
25597,The only thing that bothers me the most is them saying video games are the reason to wrong doings like shootings
25598,"Manhunt Uncensored for pc, is no longer available? Yeah right... Someone didn't do his homework..."
25599,"fox needs to stop calling things satanic racist and total gruesomeness all the news stories are just reporters that do""t have anythting else to blame these murders for"
25600,Yogscast featured in Watchmojo? Mind=Blown
25601,"Honestly just blaming video games for anything is just plain stupid! Studies have shown that games have actually DECREASED violence, however since the damn media have nothing else to talk about but violence, it only appears that violence is more common when its not. Plus the whole damn world doesnt want to admit that all the crap that goes on in life is their fault. I mean parents no long watcher over their kids, let them do and watcher whatever they want. Tv and technology practically raises kids now since parents are either too busy working or too busy lounging around in money to be bothered by their kids."
25602,So many people are morons in this world... Sad
25603,"All of them are bullshit, blaming games for crazy people shooting innocent people is fucking stupid. I'm sick of hearing about it, cause the argument has no merit"
25604,man hunt was a vary insane game
25605,"This isn't a liberals or conservatives idea. Frankly on tv when I see somebody complaining it's some hotshot liberal like whoopie goldberg saying ""MAH KIDS DON'T NEED NO CALL OF HONORS IN DIS HOUSEHOLD MMHMMMM"""
25606,"people REALLY need to grow some balls, my god, people aren't dumb enough to kill someone for what they see in a game, infact, the crime rate actually went DOWN when video games came out, games are a great way to relieve stress, and hell, ever play Metal Gear Rising Revengence? great way to release that aggression, practically everything is slicable"
25607,i have 2 say that anybody who thinks that violent videos games make you a mass murder should go $%^& themselves because these things still happened long before video game s were made because i can guarantee that Adolf Hitler did not play any videos because they didn't exist yet and yet he killed 12 million Jews
25608,"Seriously. If you are gonna call a kid's game sitanic, (pokemon) then you are a HORRIBLE person. I mean, it's a KIDS-GAME. No witchcraft or anything. That church guy is crazy."
25609,The only one I can understand being questionable is #4. That's kind of uncalled for.
25610,I started laughing when they said the alleged shooter of the mass shootings was a gamer most people nowadays are fucking gamers.
25611,What ever happened to parents being responsiblefor what their kids can play.
25612,I'm seeing a theme here with which news organizations are causing these controversies.
25613,Conservative news media is really a bitch to bare. Just saying.
25614,"Ahh yes number 1. Blame shootings on violent video games, not violent and disturbed people easily getting their hands on guns."
25615,"i dont understand how something like Call of Duty can be blamed. Truth is, i can be a digital powerhouse on that game, but put a real gun in my hand, and i would probably blow my own toe off trying to figure out how to use/load/aim and figure out the recoil, etc etc etc.
It does NOT teach you how to slaughter a school.
Music was the issue before (remember the Marilyn Manson finger pointing), and now video games has been blamed."
25616,They talk about it like crazy killers didn't exist before video games and the world was all happiness and rainbows :|
25617,"If the No Russian Mission was that bad, then why did it return as a flashback mission in MW3? I can see why The Hot Coffee Mod was discriminated, but let's be honest, everyone who's played San Andreas is gonna try to find it. The Pokmon Controversy stories, most of them are false, the only two that are true are Missingno, M, and maybe the ability to find Mew in the original Red and Green."
25618,"no one gets freaked that there are games about WWI, WWI Vietnam etc. Why is desert stormetc not fair game? There were alot moresons killed in earlier wards and many of them have parents still alive"
25619,"10. News teams are retarded.
9. Are you retarded? Jynx is also a Ganguro girl. Yea.
8. Should this even be called a game? But yea, you're trying to PROTECT the women. Damn.
7. Without this, parents wouldn't be able to ignore the ESRB warnings!
6. Every game is banned in Australia!
5. GTA makes controversy literally every release. Seriously. It's getting old, news people.
4. This game should have been released. It would have been fucking amazing. And lady, your son should have played video games instead. Also, people lost their children in World War 2, Vietnam, etc., but we're allowed to make movies about that. Fuck off.
3. You can skip this, for one. They give you a warning. You can also complete the mission without shooting a bullet at a civilian.
2. Great game.
1. Fuck. Off. Mass shootings were happening for years before video games. Conservative news needs to fucking die."
25620,"YEAH! SCIENCE, BITCH!"
25621,I still find the No Russian mission extremely disturbing. You can argue it's fiction but the real problem is this type of thing does happen.
25622,"It blows my mind how everybody loves to blame the video game for stupid shit they have done. I'm 40yrs of age and have been playing games since Atari and not one time have I thought about shooting up my school, airports, movie theaters and so on. Hell I grew up in the pj's i've seen people killed had friends murdered etc. I've seen all types on movies that depict all manners of things, but yet I have not had the urge to shoot shit up hell I live in shitty NYC where you might want to kill some fools, but I won't, why?? Because my mother raised me with an IRON FIST!! Something people forgot to do with their kids. Everything today is "" The Video Game Made Me Do IT "" no motherfucker you did it because your a ass and now you should burn for it. Stupid fuckers today"
25623,god i hate people it made me cringe. Nice list though.
25624,i knew this video would piss me off so WHY DID I WATCH IT?
25625,"Video games are nothing but flashing lights. There are several more important issues being covered up by blaming mass-shootings on the 'easy' subject. The real issue is morality. The United States does not have a formal declaration or code of morality. In truth the code of America is Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness( sometimes property). Such a vague ideal allows irrational people to think that they are able to do whatever without consequence. My other thought is that social media and USA gov't tries to convince people that violence is alien to our species. Spoiler alert violence is one of the defining action of our species. Instead of running away from it we need to educate and understand it. Food for thought: Without nuclear weapons world wars would be a hell of a lot easier because you couldn't kill a city in one shot. Without Vietnam the public would have forgotten that Asia was even on the beeping planet. Without war it would have taken longer to develop planes, radar, and even gps. Final thought: ""One cannot build unless One destroys. The old must be undone to bring in the new. This is humanity."""
25626,so nothing about jfk reloaded where the objective is to mimic the assassination of john kennedy? download it its kinda fun
25627,im played all of this games and i are a normal person
25628,ABACABB!
25629,Mortal Kombat seems so incredibly tame nowadays. lol
25630,"Mental illness, and access to guns? NO IT'S VIDEO GAMES! How fucking retarded, and people actually eat shit up and agree..."
25631,The one game controversy on this list I think ISN'T just conservative pussies whining is Manhunt 2. That game makes me cringe.
25632,"It annoys me how Six days in Fallujah was canceled because it apparently ""made war seem fun"", and when that ""No Russian"" mission shows almost how horrible real war is, ""it's TO violent"""
25633,"They say we will mimic what we see in video games. But Ive played mine craft and feel no need to build a cabin, dig holes, or mine. Ive also played assassins creed and feel no need to go climb buildings and jump off high places into hay/leaves/water etc"
25634,"It's pretty sad how stupid people can be... Yea I'm going to go out and pretend I'm an assassin, or kill cops for the heck of it, just because games like gta, assassins creed, COD, battlefield, ect... It seems to them that people can't be fucked up enough without help from a video game."
25635,LOL wow I never though I would see pokemon in this video. But WoW (world of Warcraft) has brought ALOT of controversy compared to pokemon and that would probably be a good pick for your next video.
25636,Dat mw2 scene after I played it really had me scratching my head. Why would they put that in a game when they know children play it?
25637,"I wrote a paper last year for english about the topic of how easily people are to blame videogames for realworld violence, when really it likely is the parents' fault and also that there are many other forms of violence in the media to blame.
PS: I want to bitchslap so many people in this video"
25638,So wat game were they playing back in acient times
25639,"I wrote a paper denying the claims that video games make people violent as a final last semester. I forgot how much this topic makes me upset. The people that make claims like this (parts of the mass media) don't even play the games they're talking about and like to use video games as a scapegoat for many things in society. It's ridiculous. I won't go on a rampage here, since this is YouTube and I already wrote a paper on this, but it just bothers me when video games are blamed for so many things."
25640,"Yeah, I also thought the whole airport thing was pretty shocking too."
25641,weres payday 2
25642,"Most of these, not all, but most, were because of the stupidity of a few people who got their panties in a twist and overreacted. Pokemon satanic? ****ing retard."
25643,"""Mental illness is a big problem..."" 
Huh. Who knew?"
25644,I am seriously questioning the Manhunt 2 being pulled from the Internet...
25645,"torture scene with Trevor? fuck how come i never got to that, i even beat the whole game:("
25646,Buying games that are +18 as an adult that is -30 that are censored pisses me off. If you are going to sell a +18 game WTF censor it...
25647,What about the original video game controversy.The 1976 Exidy arcade game Death Race was the first national outcry over video game violence.
25648,bull crap calll of duty killed pelople i played call of duty for 5 years and i never hit anyone!!
25649,they aren't blaming anything on Duck Hunt? !PULL!!!
25650,"There's a bit of bias involved with #1 when Mojo specifically calls out the conservative media for pushing on violence in games in relation to mass shootings. That was true back in the days of Columbine, yes. But the winds have seemed to change and in the recent shootings it has been the liberal media and pundits demanding change in games and laws and the conservatives defending it. Politics is politics. They do whatever gets them more attention."
25651,"For the love of god. Can all theese ppl stop blaming acts of lunacy on videogames. I don't know how many violent videogames I've played so far from the age of 9 and I am 30 years old now and guess what? I don't feel like killing anyone because I play violent games. It's just fucking awesome and entertaining as hell. Mentally insane ppl doesn't need videogames or movies to commit theese crimes. They'll do it eventually so cut the crap. Now if you excuse me, I got a torture scene to attend to o n GTA V."
25652,keep on fighting news you will never destroy video games if anything it stops crimes lets people take there anger out on the game
25653,"After watching this, Fox News can kiss my ass."
25654,columbine rpg should have been on this list
25655,these people need to chill.
25656,Isn't Night Trap about PROTECTING the girls!? It would help if they PLAYED the games before taking them to court...
25657,"I don't get the portal 2 one. I mean I understand it, but why do people have to get upset at everything!? My family and I are in the process of adopting, and that line is still hilarious!"
25658,"Videogames are supposed to be for entertaiment, not to turn people into killers, how long will it take the media to learn that..."
25659,"Videogames are supposed to be for entertaiment, not to turn people into killers, how long will it take the media to learn that..."
25660,i dont get why they always shitting around with games instead of just stop fighting with other countries
25661,"Have they ever considered the video games do not create violent minded people, but instead attract them."
25662,why is america complaining about murders in games and rape its not real in games yet in america every 2 mins a women gets raped every 4 mins 7 people get murdered Jesus shut the fuck up it happens every day and it will complaining won't do anything instead of complaint about games and miley Cyrus talk about the people who's serving your fucking country and getting killed Jesus christ
25663,what about jfk reloaded
25664,"Manhunt..who cares, its just like any other violent game. I would say mortal kombat is worse than manhunt -.-"
25665,WHO CARES PEOPLE NEED TO LET OUT ANGER THROUGH A VIRTUAL WORLD INSTEAD OF THE REAL WORLD like if i had a bad day and would enjoy killing someone my solution is killing game charicters like in skyrim go around to fight enimies...
25666,....the pokemon promoting witchcraft made me laugh.
25667,Fuck Jack Thompson!!!
25668,# 1 this is when people can't use common sense. If you play a game with guns in it people should have the common sense to not commit crimes with guns because people are smarter than that come on now. So videos games again are bashed for people with no common sense what. So. Ever! >_<
25669,Look at the comments its like we all are murderers just chatting....  can somebody tell me about this war that 500 people died and nobody knows (way to honnor who died at that xD)
25670,What about Mad World for the Wii.
25671,"Video games are not the cause of massacres. The reasons are things like mental illness, bullying, etc."
25672,liked the mission on mw2
25673,For what Six Days in Fallujah was trying to do I wish it was made. I felt like it could've taught us something more about the event because I haven't heard about this until recently. And how come Battlefield and Call of Duty don't have so much media attention for what they have done with their games?
25674,This is why I don't watch the news.
25675,"Wha, no deadspace X)"
25676,"I just wanted to point out that it's not just virtual guns that get blamed. It's guns in general. Whenever some worthless shit stain goes hellbent with a firearm, firearms get blamed. I just wish these so-called experts and there throng of excessively blind followers would get a clue. Guns are inanimate objects. Guns do not do anything by themselves, period. If someone hits me with their car and I die people are not going to stop driving cars and car manufacturers are not going to stop producing because of it. Why? Because the car is not to blame nor is it at fault. Regardless of whether or not people like or dislike guns; blaming an object for the wrong doings of a human being (we consider ourselves to the be most intelligent life in the known universe) is just plain idiocy. You let me know the next time your toaster leaps off your kitchen counter and goes on a morning killing spree, then I'll retract my statement.."
25677,U miss JFK Reloaded
25678,"With #1, I find it incredible how they always focus on the few shooters compared to the millions of gamers who haven't done anything even remotely against the law. Seriously, ""Ah, this guy went out and shot a bunch of people at a school, it must be because he played video games and not the fact that he had mental problems or was bullied""."
25679,huh all in all people want something to blame for the attacks and its no surprise they chose games that contain violence and that's what all the games in the list contain. i don't care if im repeating what others said but there is less violence then there has been for a long time. of course there are those games that go over board like rape lay as one u said i saw nothing on that. at some point sh*** going to hit the fan and gaming going to take the blame
25680,i want to hear the top 10 bs news stories by fox
25681,the mass killing of Russians. Thats too much.
25682,I really can't understand why people think GTA is some weird contorted disgusting game. The storyline is modeled from the world WE live in. People go on shooting rampages. People torture each other and steal things. That's just what the world lives in.
25683,stupidity and irresponsibility towards the children always have a scapegoat. Games do not shape psychopaths. Bad parentship and miseducation do.
25684,check out my twitch channelhttp://www.twitch.tv/program111/edit
25685,"I rather like how the fox news reporter in pink, Doesn't let the man explain the funding cut and talks over him for the battle of fellujia game. He more than likely would have brought up things such as medal of honor and Call of duty etc. Where we have things like D-Day and such which are being turned into games for todays youth. The only thing about the battle of Fellujia. Is that is was closer to the current date. But that's one reason why you should hate fox news. Not only do they lie. But they refuse to allow even live interviewers to defend themselves and cut to another segment in order to appear that they have the moral high ground. And it's not just this they do it with, it's with countless things."
25686,You don't know how much my heart dropped when I saw the news bitching about Portal 2. >:(
25687,........
25688,I thought mortal kombat would be N.1
25689,ALL of them got on my nerves. ALL.
25690,people are fucking stupid if they think Video Games turn people into murderers. there must have been something wrong with that person before.
25691,i fill that the game the witcher 2 is brilliant and alot of people like the press said it was banned in Australia that information is untrue the game is and always had been available to buy in Australia.
25692,"Yeah, those idiots happily bash Mass Effect for having 'romance' (which is sadly a dying art in western society) but totally look over RapeLay.... which is a FUCKING RAPE SIMULATOR!"
25693,all of them piss me off!!!
25694,God I hate the news. I've been playing violent video games my whole life. I'm fine. It's called decent parenting. And I said DECENT.
25695,no almost everyone in Australia has saints row 4 and we have all of those games now
25696,hang on listen to this how do they find out about the violence unless they play them there selves?
25697,"So it wont let me replay directly, but person way down there, when was there yogscast in here? its bugging the hell outta me"
25698,I wonder how big of a piece of shit you have to be to work in the media.
25699,"games doesn't make a person bad, failing on a mission make person bad for sure"
25700,"these people who make controversies about video games are so naive and pathetically stupid. They thought video games makes people violent but they are so so wrong. Most young people play video games, and if video games do make people violent, the most despairing event in human history should've happened years ago. It is clear that they have ulterior motives in wiping video games in human history and i'm pretty sure most of them are parents who have children who are addicted to video games."
25701,manhunt 1 and 2 the best games for the ps2
25702,"a game about war getting bat press fron anti-war people? videogames are a form of entertainment the problem is that it has ""game"" in the name, you make a war movie and you have an oscar, make a war game you get bad press"
25703,One...more...top......10.....
25704,There should be one about the top ten tyrants in washington whom are unrelentingly petitioning to destroy our constitutional rights! I guarantee you more you tube hits than you've ever had before! Bet you don't have the balls for it though...
25705,"I think that video game controversy is illogical, it's mostly a press thing. For example; Six Days in Fallujah. It's terrible what happened there, but what about all other war games based off of real wars? Millions died in WW2, but look at all the games based off of that. And look at Call of Duty in general, all you do is kill, so it's not a fair argument to cancel the game based off the argument that people died there. People die in war unfortunately, but Six Days in Fallujah could have easily been a great demonstration on just how terrible war is, and just how bad Iraq was for everybody. So in my opinion it should've been released, because it could've been a great game that could've spread a powerful anti-war message.."
25706,I always thought it was funny when the news tried to blame video games for all of these horrible events. Even though like the video mentioned studies have proven video games don't cause people to be violent. I play mostly RPGs and I have never done a violent thing in my life (besides beating the shit out of my older brother with a controller when I told him not to use fucking bombs in soul calibur as a kid) and my older brother plays mostly shooter games and hes like a kitten couldn't hurt a soul. Hes only gotten violent defending himself and his friends in school when he was a kid. you don't see me slaying shit and him gunning down people
25707,"Think about this, they blame video games but they don't blame tv or movies because they like to watch that and don't want to blame it"
25708,"The propaganda and fear mongering that's puked out over at Fox ""news"" is much more dangerous and threatening to a person's psyche than a computer or Playstation game will ever be. I've seen REAL car chases, REAL police shootouts, REAL war violence, and other REAL acts of violence being broadcasted live and glorified by these networks in order to get high ratings. And they think people like Ed Boon have some explaining to do? Fox ""news"" should be forced to have a ""TV-MA"" at the top of the screen."
25709,"Omg I hate that they blame video games for the problem, like seriously there are more logical explanations other than videogames"
25710,Better dead than red
25711,"Fox, its not the games, its the retards with assault rifles!"
25712,"Funny, Liberals say guns are to blame for murder while Conservatives blame Videogames, I say the person perpetrating the acts are to blame and I guess Libertarians like my self have that kind of common sense."
25713,"people are so fucking stupid about this shit.....just so i enjoy putting a bullet into someones head in battlefield, doesnt mean im gonna go do it real life. sure the witcher has nudity and sex, so what? its fake. leave at that. doesnt mean ill be a sex addict. and the fallujah game? it wasnt a poke at the families who lost kin, it was a way to honor and tell people about it. i wish people could drop this stupid argument about games like gta making kids want to go rob a bank or kill everyone in sight. its bullshit. ok......venting over."
25714,"The fact that there was such outrage about the ""No Russian"" mission is what made it so awesome. Same with that dude you torture in GTA V."
25715,"The funny thing is, only people who don't play games are the ones to complain. Damn noobs!"
25716,"The news, clutching at straws as usual."
25717,I never knew a ak47 has the r button and first mouse button on them the more you know
25718,Jesus summersaulting Christ! I'm sick of idiot conservatives and zealots babbling and shootings and video games! Only someone with batshit mental problems would actually do that 'cause of a game. I maintain that the violent game controversy is fueled by f***king morons.
25719,"I expected the stories surrounding the Sims, where it was alleged that you could view your sims naked and while having sex, to be on here."
25720,"I heard the Australian version of Outlast replaces the inmates with aliens. Not sure if that's true but if it is, I'm glad I got it with steam"
25721,The killing of the rat in the campaign for Battlefield 3 was also pretty controversial in my opinion...
25722,What about that Japanese rape game?
25723,Six days is still in development
25724,"Games decrease violence actually, it gives an out let. Though i play Zelda mostly so my opinion is less important. Another mention could be OOT's Islamic chanting"
25725,Controversy is just free avdertising.
25726,"that is so retarted video games don't harm the children they prevent them like if they wernt mentally ill they would say hey lets go on a rampage (in gta, saints row, etc.)but not in real life"
25727,"I wish these people would just shut the fuck up and mind their own business.
Why is Australia full of pussys."
25728,Excellent list!
25729,"After watching the whole video: I am pretty much addicted to video games. I've been playing violent ones since I was a kid. Lets see if I have ever shot a school up cause I played Call of duty. Nope don't think so! GET OVER IT, GOVERNMENT! VIDEO GAMES DONT CHANGE YOU UNLESS YOU'RE STUPID AND LET IT!"
25730,YES I saw manhunt in here already once I saw GTA. Love that game and I remember seeing it on the news when I was little. Played it since age 5. I think sooner too.
25731,"hahaha why am i not surprised fox news is all over the ""video games equal killers"" propaganda, god how can they even hope to be taken seriously"
25732,"For #1, may i remind many of Foamy the Squirrel's great rant."
25733,i bet if ya told those old news reporters james bond was promoting violence because it made everyone want to shoot people mid-air they'd shut up
25734,3:43 kinda sounds like seth rogen
25735,Murica an it's guns dumb guys playing video games and dumb guys selling guns to those dumb guys like if they were candies
25736,What about movies with guns. What about songs that say I'm a roll up on a fagot with an ak and blast him in the head. Those don't get blamed but video games get blamed first. My sons smoking weed it must be video games. My daughters a prostitute must be video games.
25737,"There was a stupid controversy against ""BulletStorm"" in which people said it promoted rape even though the most sexual thing in that game is the main character almost giving cpr to the female character oh and dick jokes many many dick jokes"
25738,Stupid conservatives
25739,how about we blame the parents that don't want to mind the child of their own? Considering they have kids playing games that are FOR ADULTS! Can we do that? Punish the parents for not being parents?
25740,"5:29.... i wanna slap the dumb bitch, why are other war games sold where thousands more lost lives. Call of duty? Oh thats right ..... they break records so it's ok... i hate the media."
25741,Peopleblaming First Person Shooters for people committingmass killings or Preachers saying that Pokmon Teaches witchcrafttick me off the most.
25742,Fox news is more fucked then the things they talk so much shit about.
25743,when katie kurik took on why halo was bad I lost all m games for a month
25744,"Our government wasting their time with things that are not important wait a minute, our government is still doing that today as I typed out this post.."
25745,i don't dis like any of them I love killing video game people their almost no npcs in my skyrim and its fun I tried 2 times in real life
25746,How the fuck is Pokemon satanic? Fucking idiots just looking for attention.
25747,there was a mode of a dead body of a zombie for die island and many people got very bad but the game is full of them
25748,"If anything, violent games keep me from being violent in real life."
25749,3:46 you bastards you can include anything else but the togs are sacred and off limits lolz but really they are sacred
25750,Fox News is really logical behind their statements. Organized religion is so intelligent. :P
25751,Those people on the news are retards
25752,Didn't realize there was some sort of racism when Pokemon was featured
25753,The one that made pissed off was the MW2 mission. Cant people see that this is fake!!!
25754,Those news station are stupid for blaming games to real mass shooting ignoring facts that it doesnt
25755,Almost every controversy makes me angry
25756,LEAVE THE GAMING WORLD ALONE
25757,"I personally hate when people say video games invented violence. Psychos were not created by video games, they were created by bullying and bad parental influence, as shown with almost EVERY case. When assholes say, ""mass shooters play video games,"" I tell them to fuck off and say, ""I play video games, all of my entirely non-homicidal friends plays video games, and I'm sure if you were any less paranoid, I bet you or your kid would play them too."" Children playing GTA; paying whores and killing them afterwards. That's a parenting fail not a game industry fail. For Christ's sake it say ""Rated M for fucking mature,"" right on the cover. Even blunt 11 year old CoD players don't play it because they enjoy making people die, or enjoy viciously stabbing people to death, they play it because they enjoy winning. Please, don't be one of ""those"" guys, and look at the situation before you make a stance."
25758,Ya know what has caused more people to kill each other than any video game? The Holy Bible! How about banning that! If you're gonna talk about banning video games for violence you might as well ban everything else as well.
25759,People who  copy video games have mental health problems I play violent video games all the time and I am one of the nicest people in my school.
25760,Kid kills grandma and gta is to blame
25761,If goryvideo games turns me into a killer then why doesn't ea sport games turn me into an athlete?lol
25762,"Thank you for the mass effect controversy.......
Let's see some asari action..."
25763,"I just don't get why when the littlest thing goes wrong, the media blames it on video games!"
25764,"Thank you lady at the end, you know what's going on."
25765,"I can't blame the part with ""No Russian"", except the damn mainstream media. When I first played that mission, i was a little disturbed, but really it doesnt do that to me now that I have played it multiple times."
25766,STOP PICKIN' ON MAH POKMANS!!
25767,Who's the cute girl speaking in the final scene?
25768,Fuckin' feminists.
25769,"People are always blaming video games even though there have been many studies proving that to be false. They know that they did something wrong so, as the government normally does, they blame someone else."
25770,i am 13 and you wont believe how long it took me to convince my parents into getting me GTA V. and i now see why. but it is just a game. it should have no effect on gamers in the outside world.
25771,God forbid that the news doesnt blame anything on parents. Oh fuck no its a games fault.
25772,Quit blaming the conservatives. They aren't the ones who want to regulate games.
25773,news support death everyday but go against videogames smh
25774,that's bullshit
25775,In mw2 players had a choice to skip the mission or watch the people die and not shoot you don't have to kill those civilians
25776,Games do not kill....people do
25777,"love how most of the news segments were fox news ones, we can always expect that from fox"
25778,The world has bigger problems... jeez just let me play my games and live my life. People need to care more about starving or stuff
25779,"Call me a sadistic fuck, but I loved the ''No Russian'' mission. I always knew about two sides to everything, that's why being able to be in the bad guy's shoes for even a second made me love it."
25780,"I remember The Medal of Honor game being on the News, talking about how it was inappropriate For some odd reason(Don't know why)"
25781,"The woman at the end knows what she is talking about, someone with no mental illness or disability will not suddenly go hey look a gun Im gonna kill everyone, a person who is sane will know it is not reality and understand it is a game and is not supposed to happen in reality, If you want to blame anything blame the family of the person, they know or at least I hope they know about any mental challenges and should not let them touch cetain games, especially violent games, when they don't know if the person can translate reality from virtuality."
25782,I dislike how people were getting upset over the war game. Most war games are based on real wars. Why not ban all of them?
25783,Also there are something called ratings which parents can choose to follow so its their fault that children could be playing games like mw2 and grand theft auto
25784,If your going to criticize video games for being violent then criticize movies and tv shows too. The media attacks videos games and only video games.
25785,"School shootings:
-Liberals blame the 2nd amendment.
-Conservatives blame video games.
-I blame idiots."
25786,"Really???
Mass Effect DOES NOT portray women as JUST being sex objects! Hell, you can even choose to play as a female commander, and as far as I know, she doesn't even have to be part of a relationship!!! >:( Also, the first game in that series only has a 12 age rating on it, so why is it considered so controversial? :/
P.S. I TOTALLY agree with those studies. Video games DO NOT cause shootings. I'm a somewhat hardcore gamer and I'd NEVER do something as terrible as that..."
25787,If ppl got probs with games just dont play it
25788,4:22 Wow PC gamers still say PC is best because of mods even though they nearly got GTA san andreas banned
25789,"Fox news is the stupidest shit ever they once said the end of the world could happen because the sun had a huge hot spot and flares could destroy the planet.
While these flares did cause the huge huricane in america but they were still wrong"
25790,"mine is that every gamer is obviously going to be a killer if they play violent video games which is stupid. I mean i play the binding of isaac, That doesnt mean im satanic!"
25791,The torture scene in GTA 5 was absolute pants!
25792,"i think people are taking video games WAY to seriously i mean look at hunger games they have kids KILL EACHOTHER but nobody cares they just complain about video games and how all of them are bad for shooter gamesbtw minecraft is about surviving it teaches people how to survive and people who play video games normaly have better reactions think quicker and many other better mental capability's and your saying OH NO IT""S MAKING THEM KILL PEOPLE i do think that people these days don't really get death but still it's a video game and well most people who play CoD that are idiotsare idiots in the first place so you can't blame the game for their stupidity"
25793,"My first game that involved such things were the likes of hl1 & gta3. I admit I did play these games at a age of around 7 or 8. I'm nearly 17 now and have still not once considered shooting my school, bashing a gays head in or rape a monkey (which according to bull shit news can lead too)"
25794,I hate the way people say video games change people and.inbed ideas in their head making.them go on a rampage like the.school shootings in america (R.I.P) but games dont change people...the person that does stuff like that was already.mentaly like that games didnt make them like that they just grew to.be like that
25795,i think that the most controversy event of mass effect it was gay relationships you can build they where sopoused to be in the first game but it would be more difficult because of the developers team that it was a small group
25796,the pokemon is satanic one is stupid i mean it has nothing to do with majic other than the odd mage
25797,"notice its only oldfags who complain about violent games? doesnt matter, in 15-20 years they'll all be dead, and violent games will be the norm (:"
25798,"Huh!? Resident Evil 5 ""Racism wasn't mention. I am not complaining but it amuses me."
25799,"Honestly the media is just a money making scheme really, once my dad was in the gulf doing navy stuffs (watches, patrols etc.) and a radio channel here in Aus 92.9 stated that his ship had been torpedoed when just that time when they announced it happened we were talking to him on the phone. They release these stories just to make easy money"
25800,Americas poor understanding and huge amount of stigma towards mental illness is more of an issue than video games
25801,don't play violent games
25802,"Here in Spain one of the biggest controversies came with the Final Fantasy XVIII... One guy who played the game usually, who also was schizophrenic, one night killed his parents with a Katana. Os course the controversie was for the game. Nobody from the press asked why the parents let their schizofrenic son had a fucking katana at home...
Of course some of the controversies has sense. But other are stupid.
Pd: Sorry is I made any mistake writting in English"
25803,Mortal combat is hard
25804,"i am play gta v most of the day, you don't see me going on a rampage :)"
25805,I would like to say the news are idiots but they're not they know exactly what gets them views so if they report on an extremely ridiculous video game related story it may become controversial and gain a lot of viewers. So overall the news is not stupid they're just assholes.

25825,"Its not because of the game that massacares occur. Its just the person have mental disorders, I play those type of games and I never want to kill anyone... EVER!"
25826,And of course Fox news would be on most of the clips. Just another reason why they suck
25827,Fox News  is always saying something fucking stupid smh
25828,"It's called rated M. Does no one get that? If u are under age u need a parent to buy the game for u and they tell the parent what type of violence is in the game. Also, if the parent knew u had a mental issue/ etc., then don't buy ur child the game. Statistics even show that it's all wrong anyways so why even bother?"

Also with the fellujah game, if it had been a movie they would have said it honored the soldiers yet how many people would've gotten a laugh out it if theysaw a death that looked funny?"
25837,Rockstar thrives on controversity.
25838,"It seems like most of the controversies are from people who have no idea what they're talking about yelling until they get their way, although some are understandable."
25839,I hate ALL of these stories. fucking conservatives. at least most of the time.
25840,It's fucking retarded that people would blame video games for violence.
25841,this peeves me off!
25842,i thought free country hmm
25843,No surprise the the majority of these complaints were from Fox News.
25844,"they just use video games as an scapegoat to explain why all these violence occurs, that's pretty much the big story of it"
25845,"You know what pisses me off! Is idiots who never even watch Fox News and blame them for everything! They are the most balanced news channel and bring up topics that piss everyone off, that is how news is suppose to be morons!"
25846,"Give me a break! I watch Fox News all the time, they are the only channel that questions everything including video games. Get over it, violent media wouldn't make money if it wasn't for Fox News. If your violent media doesn't hit Fox News, your never going to make money."
25847,"I figured it out...
the reason is simply, these people arent gamers.... but everybody watches movies.... if you blamed the movie industry for everytying you would lse it, so push it off to the more niche entertainment Medium.
Truthfully everytime somebody blames a violent game they are just a bunch of ignorant morons, who ignore that worse shit happens in movies, worse so because they are real actors being portrayed as having been slaughtered opposed to a series of 1s and 0s"

25849,0:35 seriously? people are stupid sometimes
25850,"I'd argue that video games PREVENT tragedies like Aurora, Sandy Hook etc... from happening. A person with a lust for destruction can play video games to take out aggression and not do it on real people."
25851,"I'm surprised the Resident Evil 5 racial controversy wasn't brought up at any point. Seriously, I remember that being practically the only topic of discussion on some networks back in 2009!"
25852,"Some people and most of the media love to blame anything they can when a shooting happens.  Whether it is a video game or the weapon, they refuse to admit it is the person's fault.  They always have to have something to blame."
25853,I fan girled when Saints Row IV and GTA V showed up. x3
25854,"I remember when Tennis for Two started the whole fiasco of children killing their schoolmates with tennis balls and rackets. And once Pong came out after, the bloodbath started all over again."
25855,"People should know what these so called ""Mass Shooters"" have been through, things like Bullying, Beatings and mockery from other people in society!
Instead of blaming things like these on ""Games"" why don't you raise awareness over the damages that bullying, etc can cause to society.
Without all the violence done to them people will never think about killing someone.
And they sure didn't do it just for the fun of it.....
DON'T BLAME GAMES! FIX YOUR SOCIETY INSTEAD!"
25856,fox news is retarded anyway
25857,"god the media will do anything to distract the public from the real issues going on in the US. Who cares about what video games are about, any normal person knows its just a game."
25858,Fox news makes money off of war but games can't.
25859,so when is xenoblade for the wii u coming out again?
25860,Video games didn't do shit to the people.
25861,Is it okay if I made a Rambo face at the No Russian mission?
25862,2 words. Reality Television
25863,MORTAL KOMBAAAAAAT!
25864,That war of fugi game would be legit. I mean yeah I can see why people think it would be disrespectful. But actually I would like to learn about the battle. Instead of watching a reenactment on the history channel I would rather be apart of it.
25865,I don't care GTA is still fun.
25866,I love how Fox News covers almost all of these.
25867,"Manhunt 2...
I would love if someone made a mod where you kill all those idiots claiming ""games are bad"".
Many games they judge aren't even bad, for example pokemon is a fun game about fighting monsters and fainting them without any gore or murder involved, yet the media went completely APESHIT just because a few people asked unrelevant questions out of their asshole.
I bet those people do not even play games and so have no experience, so why are they judging about what they do not know?
Even people like Matpat (game theory) say ""It's only a theory and is most likely not true"" but the media and government just accept speculation as the truth, making them unaware idiots.
Let make them play a few games and see if THEY go for a killing spree."
25868,i wonder if these news people are dicks or just people don't understand what games are

25871,Video Game Makes Fun of Adoption? The media likes to make controversy over everything.
25872,the guy that said anything electronicaltht kids use they have an increased chance of them getting cancer
25873,"always stupid when they start blaming video games . they say "" we copy what we do in game and then act like so in the real life "". full of sh@t, if that was the case i would be running around with a massive sword killing dragons or keeping my radiation down in a apocalyptic wasteland fending my butt of from monster that will "" rape me "" . wish they would lay off the blame game . :P"
25874,"Just saying, for MW2 at the beginning they give you an option to play this or not."
25875,I think that gta and mk are too clich too even mention
25876,"My parents were really old fashioned when it came to video games. I was still chillin with my nintendo64 while all of my friends (ages 15-17) were spending hours upon hours with COD and Halo. Ironically, being the odd one out was more emotionally wrenching than any of the actual game content. we all know your not gonna shoot someone cause the tv depicted it, regardless of how ""realistic"" it was. this is becoming the social norm for urban kids to interact. gtf over it."
25877,"I love to kill digital people and have been doing it for a very long time and I would never kill for real. I love to kill digital animals in hunting games yet wouldn't actually go and do it for real.I think there is more to these real life killers then video games,music and movies as to why they do it in real life."
25878,"Next up, PETA is gonna rip us new ones for playing Duck Hunt for the NES."
25879,And super mario brothers was the cause of kids growing up to be plumbers and jumping into large pipes and eating mushrooms and fighting giant turtles.
25880,A little boy finds a handgun lying on the counter and accidentally shoots someone. And what does the media do when they find out? They blame violent video games instead of the parents who leave the gun lying on the counter.
25881,It just a fuck game people who think at o it ruined life minds by playing those game  and think that kids are growing up to be killer that is fucking  dum
25882,"So people can handle sex, decapitations, gore, and all that shit in movies, but when it comes to video games, nope. They ain't gonna have none of that."
25883,wait Mortal Kombat number 7? should be higher but agree with your list otherwise
25884,"Maybe instead of video games making people violent, people who are already violent like violent video games. I think the bigger issue here is gun control and conservatives like to blame video games because they want to ignore the real problem. In regards to violence in video games though, I do think that there needs to be more of an effort to keep them away from young children. I know that there is rating system in place, but there are a lot of bad parents out there, or ignorant parents, who let young children (10 or under) watch and play things that they aren't mature enough for yet."
25885,"These news people are laughably blunt. How about the thousands of other people who bought the game and are perfectly normal? One person goes on a tragic rampage, but is it right to get a scape goat and blame it on video games? How many people are out there who play GTA that are completely normal, nice people? Millions?"
25886,"How about people claiming that Mario in a cat suit makes him a 'furry' ?
EXCUSE ME?
Did we NOT play super mario bros 3 ? Which had both frog and raccoon suits :/
Super Mario Bros U? Squirrel Suit? [sigh] really.....
Seriously ......just.....wow people......really...just wow..."
25887,Wait.... But isn't Doom pretty much satanic? it's about demons from Hell that escape on mars and posses people.
25888,I knew Kim's laugh anywhere.
25889,they say gamers have no life....but gamer's choose to have many.
25890,man i live in australia and i actually didnt know this happened!
25891,I wish they didn't rate them.
25892,"So, games cause violence and shooting? What about movies? I don't hear ""Blackhawk down made my child join the Army and get killed in Iraq."" or ""Battleship made my child join the Navy when I didn't want them to."" And my favorite ""The Hurtlocker made my child become an E.O.D. and they were killed by an I.E.D."" Also the movie Rampage where the guy goes on a mass shooting in his town killing many people. That movie was not blamed for any mass shootings whats so ever. Not to mention other things like ""Spoons made me fat."" ""Pencils made me write the mistake."" Society is just fucking retarded."
25893,HAH! They used yogscast
25894,"If anything, videogames stop people from killing eachother. Games like GTA and CoD allow kids to take out their anger and frustration in a virtual manner. Blaming mass shootings on 1st person shooters (or any violent games) may seem somewhat reasonable, but is completely stupid since there's no evidence suggesting otherwise."
25895,"i think the pixelated game ""calm time"" would be on this list"
25896,"Yeah, right... And what videogame has been humanity playing for the past 6 thousands years... the number 1 is, by far, the most ideotic thing that people said about videogames..."
25897,Bunch of old pussy's with nothing better to do result in the making of this video. THANKS GOVERNMENT!
25898,Some people just think that everything causes bad things to happen. MW2 STRICTLY said that there is offensive content would you like to skip it? choosing no it would say are you sure? you will not be asked again. and can someone get back to me on this by saying how people thought pokemon was satanic and displayed witchcraft?
25899,wtf!? 480p in 2013 nearly 2014
25900,This is why I hate the news and congress and dumb asses.
25901,#3 THATS WHY IT SAYS ON THE GAME DO YOU WANT TO SKIP THIS MISSION?
25902,"Anybody else notice that a lot of mass murderers in recent times are MENTALLY ILL. Jesus Christ, don't blame a medium enjoyed by (almost) all ages for something someone can't help."
25903,"Its such horseshit that when debating video games, the media doesn't actually have to use sources or any accurate facts. They don't even have to know jack shit about the subject. They just make up stuff to win their debates. ""Gta players awarded points for killing citizens."" No, they aren't. ""It's a game about trapping and killing women."" No, it's the exact opposite. But it doesn't matter."
25904,Movies have more of a impact to the humans mind than humans
25905,"Saying that videogames cause violence is stupid! Some of the most notorious criminals, Hitler, Jack the Ripper, Ted Bundy, had never played violent video games in their life and look what they did! (Dont mean to offend anyone by using those 3 examples btw)"
25906,"I hate that people blame video games for killings. I'd kill someone, but not because a video game ""told"" me to. I'd kill them because they pissed me off. Sure, I now know effective ways to kill people because I did them in games, but if I never played those games I'd stillkill someone, but crappily. Everyone has the potential to kill, but some do and some don't. But likeCounterMallo said multiple comments below me, people were killing long before video games even existed. So, what makesnow any different than then?"
25907,Stuff like this makes me question the media.

25910,"The ESRB rating system is a bad joke. Often resorting to overkill ratings such as giving a ""Teen"" rating to martial arts/ fighting games(Such asthe one based on the Naruto series which was made for boys 7+) because of a character throwing a punch, using a weapon or a female character being busty or fanservicey.
Another is Fatal Frame (PS2/Xbox) given an ""M"" rating for ""Blood and Gore"" The most you saw was a bloody handprint, bloodstain on a wall or floor, or the butterfly pattern bloodstain on Sae's kimono. If you want to look for the cause of violence, ""anti-social"" behavior or general douchebagery, look at the individual responsible."
25911,dont blame video games its just because people are crazy fuckers
25912,Any fucking news room that blames a game for a shooting. ITS NIT THE GAME!!! ITS THE PERSON!!!!!
25913,It's funny how butthurt people get over a damn video game just because it depicts U.S. soldiers doing what they get paid to do and is supposedly historically accurate!
25914,Man only fox news hates video games
25915,"Blaming Video Games.....Why don't we blame horror movies? Has anyone not though that if Doom, Mortal Kombatand GTA are to blame for all of this that SAW, Halloween and Insidious might have something to do with it as well? Hmm....the movie industry is always overlooked-even though the content in it as bad if not worse than in games, and is more readily available to the public....."

25920,Yes that last lady said the TRUTH some people have mental problems and wanna do things like Trevor from GTA5 burned down the O' Neil brothers house
25921,It's just people who choose to be offended over video games. It's not worth getting Pissed off over people who only like to blame off topic study's. It's almost like arguing with a 4 year old pretty much.
25922,What I find funniest about this is that the media just loves to blame whatever is newest. People thought records played satanic messages when played backwards. The media used to blame movies exactly how it blames video games now. Its all just society's blaming game.
25923,it makes no scence that we can make world war 2 games but not the war of fuji
25924,Poor Pokemon. Why is it that the most innocent franchise got attacked the most?

25939,"How bout Mario? I mean he kills toads and gets points for that since Bowser turned every toad into brick blocks. And, Mario doesn't even have any kind of thought of not murdering his enemies, like for example Solid Snake and Max Payne does."
25940,No Russian is the best mission ever in cod.
25941,I love how the real controversies are the lies and the misinterpretation by people that don't play games rather then the games themselves.
25942,"Why do people always blame video games for everything, murders, shootings, satanic messaging towards children. PEOPLE ITS JUST A VIDEO GAME!!! Let's say that your playing a game like Mario for example. Is playing Mario really gonna tell children ""hey jumping turtles is a good thing."" NO!! It is a video game so I suggest people should stop blaming video games for everything!!!!"
25943,"It's funny- in No Russian, we were never told to kill the civvies. That was your decision to make- and as you said, it is skippable."

25955,If everyone was affected by Video games I'd be popping pills and chasing ghosts. The solution is simple.. Don't like what you see? Don't fucking play it.
25956,"I kind of understand the concerns people had about Six Days in Fallujah. However, I would see a game like that as a memorial to the people who died there, not some way to exploit it or marginalize it. A war game that is based on real events and objective sources of information. I WANT to see a game like that come out."
25957,"I knew it!. I knew I hated mushrooms, and radishes for a reason.....thanks Mario"
25958,and I seriosly doubt the right wing conservatives are the only people who dont like violent video games
25959,"Why is fox the main news here ? what msn,CNN,cbs,abc didnt have some shit to say about games ? Its every network not just Fox, watch mojo really just showed a ton of fox caue they know people dont like them , cause we havsebeen brain washed by comedies always talking bad about fox news. Fox is actually a great news network , mabey not about video games , but everything else they say normally is very very true. There the only ones speaking out against our tyrrant of a president. The only network doing that might not be so wrong ."

25978,"666 (666,693 views) oh god it's the end all over again!"
25979,"Remember when they blamed GTA V before it was ever released! I mean come on, some people get games early but they normally have a lot of connections and are usually YouTubers, the guy they blamed in no way would have been able to get GTA V early"
25980,"there is a reason most of these games are rated M. yet you still see little kids playing them, so... blame the parents, not the games for these incidents. the psn honorable mention was the only unavoidable one."
25981,"Ah, sure when a homeless guy goes on a rampage, ""someone"" states that it is because of video games. BS!!"
25982,You know what i hate?They say kids are effected by games but WHY ARE THE ADULTS BUYING THE GAMES FOR THE KIDS IN THE FIRST PLACE!?

Ignore ALL the PROVEN SCIENTIFIC DATA, and pick and choose whatever bullshit you believe to be enough to spew all over the media so you can make a name for yourself and sell your self righteous book to ass kissers and fucking idiots.

Maybe I should write a book huh?"

25991,"well what pissed me off the most after all what you mentioned was when a german tv channel made a segment about the gamescom and called gamers literraly: stinking, sweaty, fat and aliens... was that year at gamescom and the people they showed and they talked about made for maybe 3% of everybody who was there... they made some kind of apology after they got criticised heavely but it was still a dumb and stereotypical thing to say :("
25992,Wonder why the postal series wasn't mentioned.
25993,fix news fox news fox news almost every time.
25994,It is not video games fault that people go on mass shootings it is the guns that America allows in Britain we don't have guns because we learned from that.

Darth Out."
25997,Bullshit! Games aren't always appropriate but that doesn't mean that they're to blame. Have you ever taken into account that the shooter might just be crazy as shit. My 8 year old bro plays these games with me or by him self but understands its fake and cant be done in real life. He would never think of killing anyone ever.
25998,l had a feeling fOx nEwS was going to be all over this.
25999,"Funny how violent movies NEVER get any of this hideous negative attention. Video games are not that far from movies, just because you press a button to make it happen doesn't make it different from just sitting back and watching it happen."
26000,"I am so sick of dumbasses in press and on news running their ignorant and idiotic mouths about how ""Games cause kids to be violent and can lead to psychopaths."" Well no shit you moron, sure there are violent and bloody games out there. It's up to the parents to make sure their kids don't get into those kinds of games. But they're basically saying every murderer and mass shooter played a violent video game that lead them to do that. God help us if these are the pathetic excuses of people we have in our highest levels of society."
26001,Did people play these kind of games when world war 1 or 2 started? How can they blame the video games about the crime?
26002,That woman at the end had the right attitude about it not just blaming something non tangible like everyone else
26003,lol they must think the world if full of mental cases if they think ppl will go out and do the thing they see in video games. Really funny stuff

26013,"Ohh, they featured kim! Awsome."
26014,Kim!
26015,"heeeeeey, its kim From the YOGSCAST!"
26016,"Why is everything in a videogame bad but if it was in a movie: ""Oh its just for entertainment!"""
26017,its like when there was a shooting at a navy yard (i think) and they blamed GTA 5 even though GTA 5 wasnt even out and the guy was dead by then anyway.
26018,"I'm sure they said the same thing in Rome and the coliseum before the society degraded into madness. The more violence people take part in, the more they want it. It's well known in psychiatry. Yet stomped out because it also makes money."
26019,geezus these controversy videos can be scary
26020,Some person who killed these people played wow and cod
26021,If games makes us kill wouldn't there be mass shootings 24/7?
26022,"Ahhh, good old Fox. Jesus Christ they are so annoying."
26023,when the press stated videogames give you brain cancer? that pissed me the fuck off
26024,why do the blame shooting games for killings its bad parenting doing that

26027,"So let me get this straight...
Doom was considered satanic cause you went around killing demons?!?!?!?
thats something a bit odd to complain about...i thought all the religiouspeople out there would be happy for...killing off demons and evil shit...sending them back to hell and basically pissing the devil off.
i get that its violent...but lets take things into reality for a second.
If demons really did get on the planet and start attacking people a military response will be inevitable...people will come together to fight the bastards...special occult units will be made to combat such things...
its also very possible that we would win the war with conventional weapons alone...the demons may know evil but they dont know war like we do...war may be evil but its not evil when your war is against that of which evil embodies....the image of evil....demons.
if your war is against evil then that war is a good war...and a war we should all be fighting.
so i dont see what these friggin people are moaning about...if i killed a fucking cyber demon with a machine gun i better get a nobel prize for bad assery a thanks from humanity...and a shit load of pussy for me to pound.
and when i die i expect no less then the most beautiful godesses to be waiting for me in my bedroom in heaven.
all joking aside...demons are bad...them dying is good...brutally mowing them down with a chain saw is even better.
end of story...shall i tell it again?"
26028,What leads them always to violent video games
26029,i can allready see that because of number one the game creators one day will force you to take breaks :l
26030,"It's fun how people blame video games for school shootings and stuff like that, when getting hold of a fire arm is almost as easy as buying milk at the local store :P"
26031,"just don't allow people with ""mental illnesses"" to play these games
there blaming video games for these crimes, but its really the criminal themselves choices that lead up to these crimes.
blaming video games is like a 2 year old blaming a friend for ""making them"" break a rule."
26032,Their just games seriously
26033,"in pokemon animals fight, its nature"
26034,"Some parents need to realize that its not the video games making kids violent, violence is a every day thing. If a parent has such a problem with a certain game the don't buy the damn game for your kid. Its common sense. They need to realize that life is not perfect a child will be exposed to violence whether it be through the news, movie, or even every day life. People can be violent, one of the ways to make sure your kid will be fine is to prepare them and teach the a little something called Right and Wrong."
26035,Harvester should be on this list
26036,"oh come on. Pokmon doesn't teach people the act of witchcraft, what are you on?"
26037,I HATE fox news
26038,"I've been playing GTA since the age of 6 and COD since 10. I have never killed someone or even considered it and I even didn't shoot the Russian civilians in the MW2 Mission ""No Russian"" because I am just a normal guy. And like a normal boy I enjoy shooting games but do not bask in the killing of people.
Some people are crazy and most are normal therefore I say it has no dangerous effects on the mentally stable.
Good list though."
26039,In the most shooters you can play a Terrorist organisation named USA
26040,i love when the media try to blame everything violent on games its just stupid i mean im a gaming who plays gta 5 and i don't see myself walking outside the door to go on a mass killing spree they are just blaming games because its the easiest thing to blame
26041,What about Bully?
26042,in pokemon you dont kill animal you send your own to kill other animals its pretty much nature
26043,"The media are fucking stupid. I really hate how annoying they can get... Oh it has to be linked to violent video games, it can't be because the parents were violent towards the child or they just make allegations that are so far from the truth it's not funny... I hate the media so fucking much"
26044,blaming games or any type of media is ridiculous wat happened to people just being crazy ?
26045,lol kim
26046,yeaaaah the no russian mission was pretty crazy hahahaha loved it to death
26047,"They are just games, sometimes even the publishers don't mean to have a link to violent acts... I am especially angered to the Pokemon thing, Nintendo made this series for kids... Even the ESRB rated them around E10, I'm sure that Nintendo didn't mean the animal abuse topic the media put out..."
26048,Was that Kim of the Yogscast? :D
26049,"*5:18*
This right here is my big problem with the whole culture of video game ""controversies"". Honestly I wouldn't think twice about them if it didn't always wind up like this. There will always be differing opinions no matter what, and you're never going to change everybody's opinion. However, this rather common tactic (it's not exclusive to video game debates, but does seem to happen with a higher frequency) of inviting the defending developer (or a spokesmen at least) to the show, making pointed claims, and then absolutely refusing to let them speak in their defense is rage inducing (usually the supposedly neutral negotiator speaks over them, or the opposing party takes up the entire time slot leaving little if any time for defending the point).
You want to make claims (often without evidence, but whatever)? Fine. You want to be entitled to your own opinions? Fine.
But at least have the decency and guts to be willing to defend those beliefs against the ones you yourself are railing against."
26050,WAIT! CHANNEL 3 TALKED ABOUT PORTAL 2?! MY PORTAL 2 ON THE NEWS?! I have to punch something. The media should just stay out of gaming stories. they embarrass themselves by even trying to get into it.
26051,"The one about video games influencing people to go out and shoot people is absolute bull. People outside of the gaming community think that just because a game has a lot of violence in it, it influences the player into doing something in real life. That's just bulls**t. It's just like the woman at the end said. You have to take EVERYTHING into account, such as mental stability, amount of playing the game, enjoyment of certain parts of the game. These are just a few factors in what can cause someone to go out and shoot people. It has NOTHING to do with JUST THE GAME!!! I am 14 and I understand this and yet you have grown people saying that video games influence your behaviour. If you read a book or watch a movie, don't they influence you to wanna do something with your life like become a pirate or a wizard? Why isn't Harry Potter getting pulled up for influencing people to want to learn magic? Because its harmless fun. It isn't real. If you have a mental illness then maybe it might feel real but that depends on your mental stability. People need to understand that video games are just like books and movies. Sometimes they are meant for older players as with GTA and sometimes they are family games like Super Smash Bros. If you are from outside the gaming community and want to criticize it, either become a part of the community THEN criticize or Get The F**k Out and Shut The F**k Up!"
26052,the mass effect one is bullshit lol
26053,"ahhh i remember the good old hot coffee,still have a original version of gta san andreas with it,was fun to watch about 5 times except getting the excitement all the way up was a pain.
awesome video i give it a 10"
26054,"The whole ""Video games cause violence"" thing is the stupidest debate i've ever heard. Sure, a few shootings have people involved who enjoy violent video games, but considering the amount of people who play violent games and DONT go on shooting sprees, im pretty sure they are ALL isolated incidents. Not to mention anyone with half a brain should realise games are games, and not to take I to real life. If you don't realise that, then you were brought up badly, and any blame for violence is due to parent neglect, over what games you play/played."
26055,video games dont trigger kids to kill its called bad parenting
26056,They should have put the xbox one premiere at E3 2013 as one of the controversies.
26057,I feel bad because that mission in cod was my favoeite and im american
26058,"If we (the US) can ever get our healthcare system working, I think we'll prevent a lot of shootings. More people with proper insurance means more people who can afford to go to a psychiatrist to get their kids checked for mental illnesses. People don't go on massing killing sprees because of some violent images they saw or some game they played. They do it because there's something psychologically wrong with them."
26059,didn't cod do something like the war game
26060,"The thing is I was at GameStop and a man asked what's a shooting game for kids. The ratings don't even work anymore I go to a private school cause there's ""bad schools"" in the area and all the kids talk about at my school is GTA V or something about sex."
26061,"Number one country for mass murder? Yeah, you guessed it.
Blame the video games, not the gun control laws. GOD BLESS AMERICA LOL
We know they need it."
26062,i love how most of these are like taken out've context
26063,"People need to worry about real problems, like hunger and poverty. These people just need something(anything) to complain about.
GAME ON, GAMERS."
26064,"The shootings thing is what pisses me off, but what REALLY pisses me off is ppl like my conservatives (and my grandparents) default to stuff like GTA4 WHEN THAT HAVEN'T PLAYED A VIDEO GAME IN THERE FUCKING LIFE!!! If this was true I would be a fucking dragon killing stupid ppl that happens to make the world a better place b/c there would be less willful ignorance...smh jesus christ ppl are fuckin stupid, humanity is totally fucked unless these ppl die out and its sad when its your own family"

26068,"all the people who say video games make people violent i ask people what game have people bean playing for 1000s of years people arnt people going to war with 10,000 of thousand of people in wars"
26069,Damn feminists and their shit-stiring.
26070,"yeah because there were no wars, no murder and no human torture before video games."
26071,wtf that women is talking out her ass about mass effect.
26072,I gues that war games r actually good a for us be course it gives us class in what to expect in war
26073,"Really? The PSN debacle should be #1. That actually affected the most people negatively. Didn't over a million credit cards get compromised, not to mention the MONTHS for which it was down?"
26074,All the games mentioned in this clip that were meant to be banned in Australia were and are in all game stores.  Mojo would be better if it did its research more thoroughly. They are trying to get an R18+ but it has not been approved yet.
26075,"Interesting how some conservatives are quick to blame video games for firearm violence, yet slow to initiate stricter gun laws.
(Not promoting any kind of propaganda[I'm as neutral as zero] I just thought it was a bit hypocritical)."
26076,Lolololol To the News: Murders happend even back in the day of samuris and even (most likely) day 1 of the world! But now there is a reason to blame those. If you haveint noticed majority of the people who criticize the game violence is the people who look like they play the wii (wii sports) for a living. They really need to learn that you have to have proof to criticize games. ACTUAL STUDIES. Not perdictions and that girl for the canceld war game she said that people would laugh at a killing WHO DOES THAT! Seriously! News needs to learn some things I really have to say about giveing proof for those things that you are talking about

26088,"if parents or other people don't want children playing violent video games, the simple fact is, DONT BUY THEM, so simple, yet so hard to understand for some idiots."
26089,"The controversy that pissed me off was the fact that Pokemon supposedly promotes animal abuse, according to PETA, or the fact that supposedly it also is thought to be satanic to religious activists."
26090,"@Kingjaymeeziethat is really close to the definition of communism. now I know you're thinking about russia, cuba, and north korea right now, but thats actually called socialism. communism was what was supposed to come after socialism. now communism, is (was) a society in which there is no need for a military, law enforcment, or government, and that citizens would be able to live in complete harmony. now video games don't make people crazy (obviously). I mean, I play video games almost every day, ever since I was, six? I don't know, back when the Playstation 2 was new. but still, I haven't shot anyone. not even a fist-fight. or a trip to the principal's office."
26091,"Fucking Government is full of shit. Its we the people, not we the government!!"
26092,"Yeah! Lets manage when and how long people can play video games, because of shootings. Shootings don't happen because of video games and if they do it is rare."
26093,*Sigh dumb ass news reporters and such
26094,I know I cant do these kind of things in real life. But now there trying to stop me from doing it IN A VIRTUAL SETTING
26095,"soondragon76 Yes,and no; because the US government doesn't give a ** about mental illness"
26096,"you know what media, screw you. people know what they are playing, they know there is violence in games. and It's true, most, if not all of mass shootings involve a mentally unstable person, but guess what they do? blame video games and guns, do they know that games help rid of stress, thus preventing a violent outrage? and PETA, lay off, ok. we know your for the fair treatment of animals, but you have to go make up problems with, out of everything, Pokemon? and I want to knock some serious sence into that preist. Ya, who said you were perfect enough to critisize Pokemon Mr. Priest? is that a scientific fact? can you make a better game? I thought not. you know what, you're not a holy figure, you are supposed to teach people what the bible says, but instead, you call Pokemon... satanic? more on guns though, heres a little story. (I diddn't actually do this)
I heard one day guns were dangerous, so I took a gun, put on the porch, and left it. It diddn't shoot anyone though, so many people walked by my house, but none of them were shot. So guns aren't dangerous. Now let me check my forks and knives, I heard they were dangerous too."
26097,Thats retarded
26098,something tells me if they blame video games for all violent acts to the point the government has to ban them completely then there would be MORE violence instead of less mostly from riots of gamers and people with no outlets for their anger. but that's my opinion.
26099,"Video games cause violence? So tell me, what game have world leaders been playing since civilization began?"
26100,"When are news casts going to get it
Guns don't kill people, people kill people."
26101,"Holy crap, the government is a bunch of cowards!"
26102,Well if they are mad about modern warfare 2 than what about payday the whole game is a terrorist and pretty much a crazy gang and I know this and I am only twelve
26103,It is such bull that they think that video games make people kill otherpeople
26104,"god, people never shut up with crap like this, some little kid isn't going to think wall play COD:MW2, oh i should go to public with a light machine gun and kill everyone in sight >:D. yeah no one thinks like that unless they have something really wrong with them"
26105,I felt so bad after No Russian...
26106,"In Modern Warfare 2, no one tells you to kill all of those people. And there are no repercussions for not killing them..."
26107,VIDEO GAMES ARE GAMES THAT PEOPLE PLAY FOR FUN THEY CAN BE REAL AND MOST ARNT REAL BUT WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT VIOLENCE AND ETC WERE NOT GONNA BECOME SOME SICK PSYCHO

26111,COD is still the best game series ever
26112,when will people learn mass shootings do not happen because someone likes a video game to much i personallylove them i played cod and battle field and halo and many others but you don't see me going around with a fucking machine gun killing a bunch of fucking people at an air port...
26113,Omg some peoples are so thick it's unbelievable :D
26114,I thought mortal combat would be #1 just because it was like the original you know?
26115,"Ya know, the people who believe that video games are bad, can just go f*ck themselves. They were created for entertainment. And that mass shooting allegations I also bull sh*t."
26116,"The call of duty mission, I never killed the civilians. I didn't know you even could.."
26117,"left for dead is not banned in Australia, it just uses a version where there is little/no blood when you kill zombies."
26118,Things like these are the many reasons why I hate watching the news. As if video games somehow make people more violent. If anything they do the opposite. I play games when I'm stressed out and they make me feel far better than whenI did before. It's also just another excuse for people to not take responsibility for their actions. You're weak as an individualif you truly harm someone because of a video game.
26119,"Being from Australia where gun laws are very strict, as well as a country where massacres are non existent for decades, I really think America should have stricter gun laws. Yes, yes America's constitution says people should have a gun to protect themselves (correct me if I'm wrong) but if America don't at least have a successful referendum to change their constitution 'Chiraq' and other cities will just continue to get worse, prisons will overflow and the fabric of the majority of America's society will crumble. Just my thoughts."
26120,I played GTA back when I was 8! I can say it got me into shooting guns in real life but I want never murder anybody unless they came at me first!

26129,Your ignorant political bias is showing.
26130,i agree with lady at the end its not video games its usually mental illness or some other problem
26131,all these people bashing on games are so stupid...

26138,government will complain about virtual guns butwill not do much about real ones
26139,"I think military games were they actually have a reason to fight back is a little acceptable but going on rampages killing hundreds of innocent people isn't. And I have to blame the parents, Cmon people stop letting your 5 year old child play call of duty. They are likely to be insulted, see a bunch of inappropriate crap other gamers like to put as their game profile, and its shooting other people. They shouldn't be exposed to that. Have them play Mario or a racing game..."
26140,All of us gamers are just having fun! THEY ARE JUST FUCKING VIDEO GAMES!!!!!
26141,"People are so scared of video games now a days. Just because a massacre has happened doesn't mean video games had  something to do with it. News channels need to shut up about video games and massacres. It's like this ""oh my God video games did this to this person to make go on a massacre"". So news channels go ahead and says video games are products for killing. Stupid people."

If the church can be separated by the Government, why not separate the video game industry? these people really dont just have something more useful to do than make a controversy."
26149,I like
26150,"The ones that pissed me off the most is the one mostly about shooters/FPS/TPS. There's - shit ton of people playing these games and compare the number of people that played these games and didn't kill anyone and the one where idiots actually killed people because of it, that's a really small of people that killed because of a video game. Hell counter-strike even saved a bunch of kids from a grenade randomnly lying in the dumpsters. There's probably been a lot of movies that have violence in them before video games had the technology to be ""realistic"" and did they stop makingthose kinds of movies? No, so why should video games? The pokemon being demonic was hilarious."

Iff you would take away games than there would be more death becouse of boringness and overwhelming feelings..."
26155,"It seems that the Fox News toneeds to dotheir research better, because in MASS EFFECT THEY HAVE SEX WITH THEIR FUCKING UNDERWEAR, AND ONLY IN A FEW LITTLE SCENES THEY ARE TOTALLY NAKED, hell, that is my major complain, Mass Effect say that is little censure, but they still have their underwear during sex, so there is censure, I would prefer no censure at all."
26156,"When shootings happen the media always blames it on video games what about movies and tv shows. Some tv shows have violence and sex and most movies have violence and sex. There have been violence before tv, movies, and video games."

26160,So they're aloud games about WW1 and WW2 where millions died? But not one where around 600 to 700 died?

26162,>:(
26163,"I like how most news were from Fox haha, and anyways it doesnt have anything to do with viideo games. Its easy access to these weapons. The last few mass murders in america,  since virgina tech. All people had some mental illness. Not video games."

26171,i just played gta 5 now i wanna go steal a fighter Jet..lol man i hate it when ppl blame Video games for shit that happens
26172,Fuck Australia.
26173,i understand why some of these cause controversy (3 and 4 for instance) but number one i will never understand it's tragic when there is a mass shooting and many people die however i don't understand why video games are blamed if someone where to play a lot of video games and read a lot of books who then committed one of these atrocities do you think the media will say books are to blame people need to chill out about it and realize these people are probably not in a sound frame of mind to begin with they just play video games like a lot of people in the world
26174,Video games are bad for you? That's what they used to say about rock and roll.
26175,I love when Americans say video games male people want to kill other people but guns are legal. :L
26176,The problem is people can get guns to easily.
26177,controversies about pokemon wtf has this world come to it used to be a fun game and now people are complaining about animal abuse pokemon are not animals.
26178,"I saw a news story a while back where a boy brought his dad's pistol and sledgehammer to his school to show it off.... Okay blame the parent, but get this, THEY BLAMED MINECRAFT. And some idiot ""anti-videogame"" activist ended up describing minecraft as ""A game where you shoot zombies with pistols, use sledge hammers to build and break things to make a fortress, and survive""... So....apparently to them Minecraft is a zombie murder spree that inspries violence in kids... Instead of a game which typically inspires creation and overall fun.....Right"
26179,U didnt have to kill those people but we did anyway
26180,"I'm so sick to death of the ""video games are causes of violent behavior"" bullshit. First off, human beings have been violent throughout recorded history. They did not need video games, music, or movies to inspire them.
Furthermore I've been playing video games for 32 years. Mario never inspired me to eat a raw mushroom, Sonic never inspired me to roll around in a little ball, Lara Croft never inspired me to jump over a pit full of sharp spikes or rocks.
I see games for what they are...entertainment. This is exactly what the developers intended when they design them. So what is everyone so upset about? The same thing they get upset about when people see violent movies or television. They are upset because it is a somewhat accurate representation of human behavior in ANY society and lots of people do not like acknowledging the fact that as a human being they are prone to becoming this violent themselves."
26181,I hate pokemon controversies.
26182,"people forget that just because its a game, it doesnt have to be for kids..."
26183,Im surprised Payday 2 isnt up there
26184,Don't you just love how someone under 18 can buy an R rated movie but can't buy an M rated game?!?! It's the exact same concept except some games aren't as violent or explicit as these movies
26185,Man retarded news media who know nothing about games or those that continually contradict themselves are so infuriating.
26186,"Video games are just that, GAMES!!! They aren't responsible for anything that occurs with these shootings. Psychopaths have been around long before the creation of video games"
26187,it's not the video games it's that those people are mentally ill
26188,"well I would actualy say that games actualy prevent people from killing people :D
games help peopl react in the virtual place and not go playing manhunt in tesco's :D
anyway try to imagine a hardcore WoW player trying to kill you :DD you would die laughing"
26189,"Let's don't forget Resident Evil 5 killing zombies in Africa, racist WTF, zombies are zombies, zombies are not a race!!!"
26190,i like how its FOX news that has all the remarks
26191,"its so fun seeing american media claiming that games are making people just ""I wanna kill like 50 people"" and do you know why there is so much more school massagures in us then any other place its that 55% americans own a lot of guns and thats not the proplem at all get your facts straight media"
26192,I get sooo pissed when people blame FPSs for things such as mass murder. There are millions upon millions of gamers that play FPSs all over the world and haw many have actually murder someone? Tens? Maybe even less? It does not make sense to blame FPSs for mass murder. The people that commit these crimes almost always have serious mental issues. It is pretty much an 2/3 chance that this person plays video games.
26193,"For me the most annoying news story would be the one about pokemon, where a women sued nintendo (not game freak, this isnt gonna end well) beacuse her daughter witnessed a sex scene (it wasnt a sex scene of ,""pokemon love making' it was charamander and a squirtle battling) from pokemon the origins. This fired me up seeing how the women made outreagous claims with out really knowing what its all about even for gods sake she broke her daughter's 3ds for that"
26194,"Violent games make you numb, same does violent movies. if they're going to ban violent games, they'll have to ban the movies too."
26195,No Heavy Rain or Conker's Bad Fur Day?
26196,"you know who pisses me off?
CHRISTINA EFFIN DJARLING PISSES ME OFF!"
26197,"I can't blame media outlets (especially Fox News) for making such a fuss about ""objectionable content"" in video games: gaming is still in its infancy and if history taught us anything, it's that any medium is bound to garner controversy and even regulation in its ""early years"". Look at cinema for example: ahundred years ago,it wasn't considered art by the Gov't and thus it wasn't protected under the First Amendment. And thus we got shit such as the Production Code. Now movies are widely accepted as an art form worldwide and are no longer restricted to entertainment (i.e. they're used in schools now). I'm a proud and loyal gamer, and I'm hopeful that one day, gaming will no longer be universally reviled by people that aren't gamers at heart."
26198,"""Video games that allow you to kill are reasons for killings"".
Well I have plenty of reasons this is false, but I'll just give two.
1. Murder is less common now than it used to be. There were no video games in the 1600-1800s, so I can't seem to link that up.
2. If murderers like to kill, they'd likely enjoy games that allow you to kill. This means that gamers aren't killers, but murderers may be gamers."
26199,"Its hilarious how people are so destroyed by war games. Think of it this way alright, what if we stopped making war games, stop showing kids that this IS what happens and people actually die. You think they'll ignore war? No, they'll run head first at it because they're interested in it. What is war? What does it look, feel, sound like? When they play call of duty, they get a sense of what its like and then they make the choice: Do I want to really experience all this when I can do it all without fear of dying at home? I think that battle of fallujah game would have been good, mainly because only 800 or so people died. No one is gonna remember such a small battle now a days. Oh 800 people died, was this only in a few hours? No it was 6 days. Oh? Thats a pretty good toll for only 6 days. I mean really, not trying to be heartless but look a D-Day. Everyone and their grandmothers knows about D-day whether they like history or not. I hadn't even heard about Fallujah until now."
26200,Where is Postal 2?
26201,god dammit people its a game if your kid is unstable and you know it don't let him play I played rainbow six when I was three have I hurt anyone no and I don't intend on it
26202,That last part made me happy cause at least one media reporter still has some sense
26203,no saints row 4 is out in Australia and before anyone says it isnt I live in Australia so I should know I have the game

26208,I actually dont play war games i really like playing fantasy games or mobas or some times 3 person shooters like Saints Row 4 and some 1 person shooters like L4D2
26209,Who cares what those idiots at Fox News say?
26210,i totally agree with number 1

26213,This is why that are blaming vidio games because that want kids to go out and play it is made for adolts OK it there moms disishon my moms OK with me playing violent vodio games it the parents dishon
26214,"will probably get a lot of hate for saying this but games have become way too violent, especially with new gen consoles and latest high-end PC. Or tho I dont think we can blame games for the way people behave, at the end of the day its up to the individual to use common sense and logic. i challenge game developers to be more innovative and that doesnt mean adding more violence, or creating weapons / tools to kill harm opponents."
26215,I'm suprised the columbine game wasn't on here or a honorable mention if you could call it that
26216,"Why are people so stupid?!?!?!? Nobody normal ever kills people for no reason that play video games unless they have mental issues! How about we put restrictions on mental people with video games? Not take it away, just limit it or monitor it."
26217,GOT DAMN PEOPLE ARE SO FUCKING SENSITIVE!!! BLAMING VIDEO GAMES IS THE CAUSE OF MASS SHOOTINGS AND ETC? I CAN UNDERSTAND NUMBER 4 AND WHY THE FAMILIES GOT PISSED. BUT EVERYTHING ELSE CMON MAN FOR REAL? ITS JUST FANTASY SIMPLE AS THAT!! ITS NOT REAL DEAL WITH IT!!

26220,The mass effect one made me so mad! The women in mass effect were some of the most valuable and important characters in the game! I hate how much bullshit people throw at gaming when they are just so ignorant and have such an underdeveloped view of it as a whole.
26221,"Fox news, EVERYTIME.
Creating this list stating that multiple news organisations reported on it, is basically near impossible. With the butthurt frenzy, that comes from Fox News, which is embarrassingly, the least credible news source, in the western world always leading the charge.
Conservatives, love scapegoats. Be it foreign people (or lets be honest, brown people), video games, democrats (For America specifically, however, here in Britain it would be the Labour party.) or anything none religious.
Simply put, Fox news are sycophants grovelling to there wealthy masters. And they're so infuriating to watch, and there retarded pompus hosts, would disgust anyone with a functioning brain."
26222,"I agree with the lady at the end. It seems reporters just look at what game the shooter is playing and not the mental illness or how a minor got their hands on a firearm in the first place. Look at the Columbine shooting for example with Eric Harris the medicine the doctors put him on were giving him homicidal/suicidal thoughts and they just put him on a different brand. Many people choose to believe it was video games fault because in his journal he wrote ""it'll be just like Duke, Doom, Oklahoma Bombings, and Vietnam all put into one."" But I have another theory as well that school was teaching strongest survive Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were often praised for their VIOLENT writings and short films. There are many factors to consider in a shooting not just what games did he/she recently play."
26223,"ugh people.... Video games are supposed to be fun and entertaining, and it's not REAL!! And where you kill people usually gets m for mature rating.

Sure there are usuallyMANY contributing factors to take into account, but people like these prudent uptight assholes in government jump on the band wagon and place too much blame on something as irrelevant as a video game in order to justify their own existence (and large taxpayer funded salary)."

26231,"Seriously. Those people that stopped Six Days in Fallujah from being made need sending to those places that their kids were shot at.
If there are soldiers out their that want to give their own testimony on what happened to make a game based on just that. Then let them tell their story and let people play through it. There will always be someone else that sits their laughing at shooting someone in the head but come on! They're trying to pay homage to their comrades with this fucking shit. .!!!"

It's not about the video games leading to ""kids"" killing other kids, it's about these ""kids"" finding a gun in their hands and having bad thoughts! Parents, FUCKING LOCK YOUR GUNS AWAY!!! If you have the money to buy a gun, then you should also have some to buy on a security thing, like a special locker or something...
Video games are always ""responsable"" for everything these days, but that drives me crazy -_-"
26236,your a joke for only putting on FOX news as the only and hideing the fact that the left is the ones that want things banned now days.. It's nt the 90s anymore

26238,that airportCall of duty scene was BAD ASS
26239,"honestly i think video games have the potential to cause violence, not for the reasons stated in the media however. video games cause violence in the under developed impressionable minds of kids, that's why the rating system exists its ridiculous to blame the game or developer for parents being too ignorant to know that M means Mature and not for your 12 year old. there are games geared for children, i grew up playing Mario and Zelda for Christ sake, they are still perfectly good games and it's pretty damn sad that i at 21 years old play those old games more than the current generation's age group that's supposed to be playing them. As for adults and violence caused by video games that is almost certainly due to extreme cases of mental illness and breaks with reality. and people who suffer breaks with reality like that and are known to be highly impressionable and volatile are usually under care and shouldn't have access to M rated games anyway. The problem is that Video Games are an easy out, no one wants to think ""oh these kids were bullied and were mentally ill and needed help that was never made available to them and that's why this happened"" they'd rather blame whatever game happened to be sitting in their room or whatever music happened to be on their computer than look at themselves as society and create constructive ways to properly help sick people, No one wants to look at how easily the shooter got the weapons or how easily a place that's supposed to be safe was accessed. No one will take responsibility because it's easy to turn and cry foul at something else. and until We as a society and media and whole can learn to take the proper steps to help sick people and make deadly weapons less accessible to those who are that severely mentally ill we'll continue to run in circles around these pointless issues and nothing will ever change."

26253,"I gotta say, while I don't believe violence depicted in itself can cause harm in videogames, I feel the moral values it teaches can. The footage from the ""No Russia"" mission made me genuinely uncomfortable. I used to kick ass and chew bubblegum whilst blowing up aliens back in my day. That felt SOMEWHAT justified because they where obviously badguys. What the fuck is up with a realistic scenario where you brutally massacre innocent people?"
26254,>Games rated M for mature. >Parents worried about kids. sigh
26255,I remember after 9/11 when there was some outrage with Command and Conquer Red Alert 2.

26259,This is why I absolutely fucking hate most news outlets.
26260,im just going to say that while i agree that games don't cause mass shooting i think that if someone has a mental illness that makes them perceive things differently that if they do play a game like gta 4 or 5 that it could have a effect and cause them to do it but only if they played or bought that game like 1 week prior. also fox news needs to get working on some real ideas on why games cause mass shootings.

26283,"Why can't people just stop crying over ANYTHING they don't like. Pokmon's ""black face"" was never the intention, it is a Japanese tradition dating far back. MW2 & 3 may have had cringe worthy moments, but there was a warning beforehand. GTA is making fun of America and the press pretty much nails that in the butt. Why do people go on a rampage whenever they see something they don't like? Why don't movies get ANY attention. Seriously, I think Saw, Nightmare on Elm, and Friday 13th are all a little bit more violent and have a few more sex scenes than Mass Effect and Manhunt. For God's sake, they are called TORTURE PORN!!! And games get the red flag for a crappy looking porn scene (GTA) and games that take violence a little too far (Manhunt)!? I can agree with some contreversy, yes Manhunt was obsesively bloody and yes GTA allows you to go on killing sprees, but don't movies show the EXACT SAME THING if not MORE?!"

people always blame video games, I've been playing shooters ever since i was 6 and I have not changed at all, I played No Russian mission and I didn't think, "" I'm gonna go buy a gun and go kill people."" Honestly i think the reason people keep blaming video games is for 2 reasons.
1) There's so many shooters out there. They just think about the shooters and don't really care about anything else.
2) Games like Battlefield and CoD, are war games, they try to symbolize war and why it's tragic but games like GTA when you play as a psychopath and go on a 200 cop kill spree."

26303,"I have been playing video games since the PS1 came out, which doesn't really like a long time, but to me, it is. I have played my fair share of FPS/TPS shooters, racing and various games, but playing Battlefield and CoD didn't make me go out and get a gun and kill a bunch of people, as playing Gran Turismo didn't make me race a car around me neighborhood, as the GTA series didn't make me steal cars, kill innocent people and rob banks. Just because someone played a video game and then went and did a bad thing, doesn't mean that the game they were playing made them do it, or urged them to do that thing; although there have been some cases where some guy said that he wanted to see what ""grand theft auto felt like in real life"" and went on a murderous rampage, but that's different. If a person does a bad thing and also plays video games (like almost everyone else in the day of age, ...) there most likely is something wrong with that person.Because mostly the thing that causes that person is usually mental problems and/or emotional problems, although the game might have given them the ""experience"" (haha that's a joke, loading a gun and shooting it isn't as easy as the games make it seem. Unless the game goes in extreme detail of how to load, shoot, and aim the gun accurately, there isn't much experience to be learned from video games) Overall, I think video games are harmless, but sometimes they can get too realistic, like the Manhunt series, I'm not saying graphics wise, but how they.. go through the motions. Sorry I made you guys read all this, but this is my opinion of ""video games making people kill other people/do bad things."""
26304,The poeple that are psychotic and violent prone love these games because they get to live out their fantasies of committing murder. What these news programs don't get is that crazies exist with or without vioent media. In the '70's the media blamed rock n roll for teen suicides and murder.
26305,it is bull about the video games making people violent
26306,"instead of blaming the games kids play
how bout how did they get the guns
where did they learn to use a gun
probably from their parents
im pretty sure people want to blame video games cuz they dont want to take responsibilty for their kids
its not my fault my son killed all those people(even though i taught him how to use a gun) no it was the video games fault it put bad images in his head.
The game taught him how to aim the gun, reload, take off the saftey.
So yeah not my fault i blame the game designers even though im the one who bought him the game."

26323,"Fox News are made up of idiots. There fucking jokes who just look for stories. All just dumbasses. One of the dumbasses at the last, the woman, said how we should have a list of whenever we play video games....okay you want the government to control what we do in our pastime okay lets see how you react to the government controlling guns >=)"
26324,"Wow... I recall Thrill Kill being pulled off of shelves for being senseless violence but Mortal Kombat and Manhunt both pressed on, I love MK but that's bullshit."
26325,"Fox News is anti war? I'm surprised in the past they've supported it but for jesus,Exxon, or to kill anyone who isn't they're skin color"
26326,Fox News is a fucking joke.
26327,What does controversies mean?
26328,something looks familiar at 5:34
26329,what i know from hearing stuff about mass effect you can have homosex and be a female so fuck you conservative fox news idiots
26330,what about SAW
26331,What's the game at 3:28?
26332,"Gotta love that. Worthless people, too afraid to admit that they are unable to raise decent children do whatever it takes to blame any system they can get their hands on, whether its videogames, movies, tv, or even in some cultures, books."
26333,If video games make you violent psychopaths then what the hell did Hitler or Genghis Khan play?
26334,i hate the whole video games promote violence like i have play soooo many games from gta to cod to gears of war and i havent killed anyone and my favorite mission in modern warfare 2 is no russian
26335,"Freakin stupid how people blame video games for mass shootings, instead of questioning how the heck someone (even a child) had access to a gun. Quit using Video Games, which are meant to be used for entertainment, as a scapegoat for the world's problems."
26336,Rated M games are meant for adults for a reason.
26337,"All these controversies are stupid. Except for 5:55. Yeah, that was pretty bad even for COD :\"
26338,"So, how many thousands of soldiers died in battles in WWII and Vietnam, yet there are many games depicting those battles and events. Keep in mind that there are still people alive today that were in Vietnam and WWII"
26339,I wish I could be paid millions to be a complete fucking moron on the news or mentally challenged and represent a whole fucking state :(
26340,"I HATE how people flipped shit about the ""no Russian"" thing, it says right on the FREAKING FIRST screen if you're offended by blah blah please select this and then they don't and they have the AUDACITY to say ""i was offended by this"" THEN WHY DID YOU SELECTED NO!!?!?!?!"
26341,"I also hate it how EVERY F*CKINGN Time they ALWAYS GO FOR VIDEO GAMEs its fun! there just complete retards. Its a vurtuial world that doesnt exist at all. And it doesnt mean video games cause Mass shootings. They just want to get RID of the game community of how hard they worked on there own games. And its not even that real. Mortal Kombat: you cant punch a head out: NOW IS THAT F*CKING REAL?! oh and like No russian. MW2 are you kidding me? ITS NOT THAT F*CKING REALISTIC AS IT IS ""get snipped in the foot"" DEAD idiots like the news are just wanting to get RID of video games and they are just Idiots. You dont know nothing FOX, CBN ETC they mostly lie. F*cking news."
26342,"Fuck you, fox!"
26343,"i played No russian but what i did is i never killed them :( it was kinda messed, so i just killed the swat team thats it."
26344,"Oh goodness me! I HATE it, just absolutely HATE it when people say gun violence is linked to video games!"
26345,what pissed me off the most in video games was when terraria was released and all the minecraft players lost their minds about how it was a copy of minecraft evn though the only similarity was the fact that it was made up with blocks
26346,"They ALL piss me off because if you we're to go find EVERY GAMER EVER TO PLAY AN FPS and ask them have games ever influenced you to kill some body they would probably look at you like you're fucking stupid and say no! I think the reason why games get controversy that they ""want you to kill people"" in the media's mind and it's fucking stupid."
26347,Lol. Maybe no more guns will make the trick so ppl will stop shooting each other. :)
26348,cod mw3 the family on vaction
26349,I love how when the presenter is talking about the wii version of manhunt 2 at 6:47 he moves his arm forward and flicks his wrist to show how real it is.
26350,"Getting guns in america is easy I don't live there but I know that there are gunshops and gunshops are fucking retarded, don't get me wrong I think guns are badass just that you can acces them by just buying them at your local gunshop is just stupid"
26351,You guys should've included the mission on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 where the car bomb goes off and kills the young girl with her family. That actually shocked me the first time I played the game as I hadn't heard about it before.
26352,"I really think video games are NOT the main cause..I mean, I play black ops all the time..you don't see me running around screaming rasnov's name and killing everyone who looks like stiner, dragovich or whoever that last guy is.."
26353,"ok for those people who think playing violent games will make you violent
Phoenix Wright Won't make you a lawyer
Surgeon Simulator 2013 won't make you a surgeon
Super Mario Won't make you a plumber
SO WHY DOES EVERYONE THINK PLAYING A GAME WITH GUNS MAKES YOU A PSYCHOPATH?!?!?!?!"
26354,these people will go home and watch stuff like saw
26355,Never heard of 3 because I don't really follow first person shooters and it was horrifying. That should have been number 1. But one controversial game in my opinion is RapeLay.
26356,"If video games really caused people to partake in mass shootings, how comes it only seems to happen in America? Or, at least, these are the only ones that seem to get widely reported."
26357,"If parents don't want there child playing a certain video game, DON'T BUY IT FOR THEM!!!! Children don't have money, and if they do its because there parents gave it to them. The audience that these games are aimed to are not children. They are adults. So it's the parents fault if their child is playing the game., not the game developer."
26358,"Funny how Fox News are always the ones whipping up the storm. It's not as if they didn't try to get in on the gameing boom, it's just that their games for the most part sucked."
26359,7:33 OMG really
26360,New Carmageddon coming this year! Cant wait! Beefcurtains!
26361,"All but, 3 really deserves a controversy. I mean its delibratly walking into a airport and killing civilians for a mere story."
26362,"The Re4 contro, about how it's not zombies, but Hispanic people. It almost killed the Re series"
26363,How are you gonna blame video games on a person taking hundreds of lives?
26364,"every time the news talk about games and people agree just say this
{Really games change people behavior}
i never knew i dress like Mario to go save princess from a dragon turtle? 
i never knew i dress myself as a yellow ball called PAC-man eating dots and running from ghosts?
i never knew i was a blue robot called mega-man?
i really didn't know i was a bluehedgehog name Sonic that go super with 7 chaos emeralds?
Thank you I will never know i was robot blue ball plumber that put animals in a ballS"
26365,It's depressing to realise that the yanks will always pick easy targets over tackling the truth.
26366,oh fox.
26367,"When kids start catapulting birds at pigs, or start arranging their candy by colour before they eat it, then I may start to believe there is a link between video games and violence."
26368,"video games don't make people violent, lag does!"
26369,Top 10 beatles songs of or contraversies plz plz plz
26370,Im surprised 'that moment' from SpecOps: The Line isnt on this list.
26371,"god news reporters are the biggest idiots on the planet, no wait, the people who believe them are the biggest idiots in the world"
26372,"5:05 Listen, I'm very sorry that your son has passed away, and no mother should have to go through that, but do you hear the russians, middle-easterns, or germans complaining about call of duty? Not once, so why should you? It really is just a game."
26373,"One particular ""controversy"" that always comes to mind, is when religious groups spoke out against the original Populous game by Bullfrog back in '89 (or was it '90). They actually found it offensive that you played a God in a strategy game.
Oh, and EA's staged, false controversy when they revealed Dante's Inferno was bloody pathetic... and a controversy in and of itself..."
26374,why is it all the women going on about the sex stuff are fugly >.<
26375,Shit gun laws are the reason for mass shootings not games
26376,"Where to start.. I mean, wow. You really lopsided this as if conservatives and religious nutjobs are the main driving force here. You openly say it as a matter of fact near the end of your video and then use Chris Mathews as someone on your side :(.. Al Gore,, Tipperanyone?? Nooo,, Those would be 2 of the many democratic driving forces that have tried to stop and control Video Games. Most Religions that I know don't call for the stopping or selling of a game certain individual churches have but as a whole,, Nope.. They and this is only if it was ever mentioned, tell parents to be aware of what's in a video game and to be mindful, which we all should on all things. The few nuts in the religious community that go public are only made public as a political tool,, once again look at Al and Tipper, Democratic party. ESRB brought to you by,,,democratic party, banning video games democratic party, but good luck finding the info on that. I know because I've lived through this and unfortunately I was part of that party then. I was against it but the party was pushing it hard. Am I saying conservatives have never called for it, no I am not only that the Democratic party has called for it on a FAR LARGER scale and your misleading video didn't show that actual fact. In other words mojo what you sayin just isn't so. Didn't even mention gore with mortal combat, wow, Just youtube it folks. But it's getting harder to find the truth. Now, why is that?"
26377,"that last one that said GTA V had come out after he killed the people, news fail"
26378,Hearing people say that becouse people play videogames people die is the most painfull thing i have ever exspeienst. The supidness of saying that is beond this universe!
26379,3:22 look at that fucking dog head
26380,Well the parents need to play them first or not buy them for their kid
26381,tbh i let my kids play violent games becasue i know i can trust them after all they are my kids if you can trust your kids then they should be able to play these games VERRY SIMPLE
26382,Australia sucks ass when it comes to gaming.
26383,I fucking hate these conservative fuckers who use videogames as a reason for why some degenerate has gone on a killing spree.
26384,It isn 'conservative' media that blames video games. You notice all the Politicians are Democrats...follow the money...
26385,gta5 everything about trevor
26386,"Aw man, they missed one of the best ones. Resident Evil 5 getting shit canned on for being extremely racist. tsk tsk watchmojo, tsk tsk"
26387,"I get so tired of hearing these same arguments from both sides. I can no longer become animated about it or argue some position. It's why I like the libertarian ""mind your own business and let people do what the want"" position."
26388,"I love hearing about anti war people run their mouths. People are fighting for our freedom for them to disagree.
If you don't wanna stand beside us, feel free to stand in front of us."
26389,"let me say this:
cooking mama: Does not make me a good chef.
phoenix wright: Does not make me a lawyer.
The NFL game series: Does not make me a famous NFL Player.
The Legend of Zelda: Does not make me a good adventurer.
All of the E-M Games: So why would this make me a So called, ""Murderer."""
26390,What about Ethnic Cleansing!!!! That game is just terrible
26391,"people may or may not have heard about this. But a 10 year long study by one of the major universities in the U.K. has systematically proven that violence in video games does not transfer into real life at all. That is the honest truth and you can look it up for more information, so get the word out. Video games do NOT make people of any age-group more violent. Looks like the""psychologists"" are going to have to actually use their brains from now on to really determine what is the true culprit. As impossible as that is."
26392,All the people that say video games cause people to go nuts and kill someone makes me want to bitchslap them so hard!
26393,it's so sad people just see videogames as things that create shootings and have negative energy it upsets me as a gamer every time a teen or young adult goes on a rampage they mention how he plays videogames but who doesn't play them? how come nobody thinks that about movies or tv shows it's sad that they use videogames as a scapegoat because gaming is a beautiful thing.
26394,Lol pokemon being satanic.... Lol
26395,which game is that @ 8:33
26396,"According tofull of crap news reporters, there were never any shootings, wars, or problems with the world until video games came along."
26397,Video game cause mass shootings that's bullshit my family even says it is better to happen in a video game then real life ok so here is what happens when you play video games according to the news man I love playing battlefield man I think I should do all this in real life man I should  do that
26398,It's total shit that people think killing people with guns in video games will make you think or do it in real life.
26399,Mass Effect 1?! Seriously?!
26400,For Pokemon a big one would be Lavender Town.
26401,These controversies truly make me hate people. None of these should be a controversy. People need to quit being so sensitive.
26402,did bill o'rilly had an argeument on violent videogames
26403,So much hate against fox and conservatives they believe what they want but r u gonna if it's that many liberal stations blame the guns themselves I blame neither it's the persons fault not the gun not video game if someone has murder in their heart they will find a way to do it with or without a gun
26404,"I don't get how people think Doom's satanic. You're blowing demons away with shotguns and bazookas, not inviting them over for tea. And in the novel, Doomguy's Catholic."
26405,Australia now has saints row 4 and every r18 games I live in Australia
26406,Bullshit Mass Effect ladies are only considered for how hot they are. How many guns they got counts too.
26407,as a fair point to games causing violence there was a guy who tried to steal a car with his only reasoning being that he did it in gta not to mention games are getting more graphically real which could cause trouble in the future
26408,"Violence is literally everywhere, not just video games. Movies, tv, books, even the goddamn news. Video games is not the biggest cause of violence. Religion is for one, look at the holy wars. Not only against terrorists in middle eastern countries in today, but also the wars during the crusades. There's many causes, and video games isn't just one"
26409,Fuck they're retarded
26410,"Crap of Duty is one of the most OVERRATED game franchises of all time, the gameplay SUCKS DICK"
26411,If Need For Speed does not make me a pro racer and FTL does not make me a spaceship pilot then why would GTA make me a murderer?
26412,look what on news that's two times worst then video games
26413,"It's not just conservatives, liberals tend blame violent games just as much and use it as a rallying cry for gun control."
26414,"If violent behaviours can be traced back to being caused by videos game, well fine. That, however, doesn't mean they're the sole cause. If video games were the magical cause for all of that, we'd see more murderers! Crime rates have gone done. Those deal with violence, however. People, gamers included, are still on the fence about sexuality and rape being an influence to real life rape. I think this list should have included Rapelay. That game caused some stir."
26415,I thought that Polybius would be on this list. Maybe top 10 gaming mysteries/ unsolved cases?
26416,"The reason I think videogame being blamed for massacres and shootouts is larger, older and more influential corporations and other groups of people not wanting to be responsable for what happened, like there's no publicity over what was the company that made the weapon the killer used or bad parenting, where parents neglet their children.
Of course videogame have some influence on people but people who made that acts already have some kind of problem wich was triggered by the videogame and could be triggered by anyother media, like a movie, literature or something like that.
I'm not saying videogame industry is not large."
26417,screw looking at how many a gun game is bought look at how many guns are being sold to individuals
26418,"ha, america. always ignoring the larger issues of ease of access to guns, severe bullying, lack of support for under pressure students. they focus their blame to videogames because guns are ""constitutional"". office shootings are just as spontanious and common but office workers dont play videogames. america needs to stop shifting blames on decent game developers with outright lies and lack of research and fix its own laws"
26419,"PETA, Idiots, Fox News and He who shall not be named, yep covered the biggest enemies of gaming all in one video. Bravo Watch Mojo, keep up the good work"
26420,You guys should do the top 10 creatures from greek mythology
26421,"But a lot of the hate on these video games is from FOX, which can be full of bs. And many people that play violent games don't actually do that stuff irl. The people that become publicly violent usually have some mental instability not caused by games."
26422,"Ugh, seeing government officials, or anyone in general, saying that video games cause violence grinds my gears so fucking much."
26423,"Video games are not the only violent form of entertainment. Violent movies, violent TV shows, Violent books, and the news is also full of many horrific stories."
26424,"so did people play call of duty and thats why world war I started? or the reason the valentine's day massacre happened was becauseal capone played that no russian mission
it all seems to make sense... when you dont think about it"
26425,I skipped the terrorist mission in mw2
26426,I skipped the terrorist mission in mw2
26427,robbed of good games cause of dipshits
26428,"lol that ""video game makes fun of adoption"" is from my local news"
26429,lets not forget gta iv with liberty city looking to similar to nyc
26430,it shouldn't be such a big deal 90% of the people who play these games are children the parents should be able to decide if they should or shouldn't be playing the game not the government/media
26431,"Please tell me the video game people have been playing for the past 4,000 years? Cause god damn, it has caused a lot of violence..."
26432,"They complain about violent video games but not violent movies. The world is violent, get used to it."
26433,i thought all was lost in the video game world until the very end of the video
26434,"And this whole ""videogame creates violence"" thing is bullshit. Violence has always been around. Look at religion. Religion has always created a tremendous amount of violence. Do people freak out when we talk about religion? Fuck no."
26435,Manhunt scares me haha and mortal kombat has some sick badass kills and the mass shooting things gets annoying with blaming games
26436,Fuck FOX and thier BULLSHIT!
26437,How could you forget Postal? Is this some kind of mainstream list?
26438,I'm not trying to be offensive this is just my opinion. It pisses me off that most of the shootings occur in America where guns are easy to obtain. The government should think about that more often then the fact that people play video games which include guns. Gamers aren't stupid even though we may seem like that. As a gamer my self I understand the consequences of using guns and I feel like the government is just using an easy excuse to blame the shootings. Thats my opinion.
26439,Didnt GTA always have a sex minigame? i thought you could always pick up hookers in your car at night.
26440,i likehow the only people who want to get games banned are fox news reporters
26441,I am gob-smacked :O
26442,Half of this bullshit is from the morons at Fox News.
26443,"1) We usually get pissed off when we die. 2) Accurate war games/historical games can be an excellent teaching aid. Honestly I've learned a lot about US history through these types of games, especially 1941-1945.
To me video games are a lot like movies. I learn the character and I play the character. For example GTA 5, with Micheal I try to do whatever I can for his family and take things easy and relax. Franklin I try to make money in whatever B.S. scheme I find. However I find myself playing like a maniac with Trevor. I could care less about stopping if someones crossing the street or if someone looks at me funny I don't just walk away, I wait for them to turn around and start to walk away then I punch them in the back of the head and stomp them at least 4 or 5 times (after they're dead.)
That being said should true stories in movies be banned because someones son, dad, brother, etc. died in it? No, we should learn their story and honor their memory. In fact if anything it makes you respect those men/women even more by seeing, or in the case of a game playing, what those men actually had to go through."
26444,"Has anyone noticed that every news report that seemed terrible was on ""FOX"" news? The people who lie to us straight up. Good to know."
26445,People are so stupid on the news...
26446,"If Grand Theft Auto is responsible for people going on mass shootings then why don'tI see people drving around engaging in street racing all the time because of need for speed. Or people getting lost in the mountains because they played skyrim or World of Warcraft.
2) One game about a specific war is offensive but though nearly every game was about WWII acouple yeas ago no one cares. Or Black Hawk Down. or Operation Desert Storm."
26447,This whole fucking idea of game controversies is just bs its a load of who have absolutely no clue about what they are on about
26448,"One of my favorite stories is when a kid brought a gun to school, and what game does the dad blame? Brace yourself. Not battlefield. Not call of duty. MINECRAFT. MINE-CRAFT. The game where you build things and fight zombies. WITH SWORDS AND BOWS. NOT GUNS! This is stupid."
26449,yea but in Australia you can get all those games now reatail or on steam
26450,They are just using games as a weapon of mass distraction to have an excuse not to ban guns and blah blah JUST LEAVE GAMING ALONE!!!!
26451,"Jezus...they're just games. Games(like shooters) are just not for idiots...afcourse you're not gonna kill somebody in real life...DUH! What's next,banning movies,series,magazine's,comics..."
26452,"The problem with half these news sites is that the people giving the news know next to nothing about videogames and when they bring someone on the show that works on the games or is an expert in the field; they almost ignore what the person says and interrupts them when they try to defend the claims.
Also, the Mass Effect Fox News story, the woman came back later and confesses that she never even played the game or saw anything related to the game other than the one guy's report."
26453,Remember video games and guns dont kill people but i do- agent 47
26454,Games don't kill people. People kill people.
26455,Thanks Obama.
26456,Fox News ruins everything...
26457,There is a reason that we play video games it's on the YouTube show game theroy so all of those parents who are disliking games SHUT UP
26458,No Russian is one of my favorite missions on MW2 simply because you can spray a machine gun and not miss and cause havoc.
26459,"Manhunt 2 PC edition
""No longer available""
Hahahahaha, pirates."
26460,I know this sounds crazy but how about parents stop blaming video games and question themselves if they are the real reason why children are so violent!
26461,Fuck censorship!!!!!!!!!
26462,Anyone remember casting spells in Pokemon? Me neither
26463,Were is postal?????????????
26464,Stupid fucking media and christian preachers godamn theyre dumb mofos
26465,"I find it funny how they blame violence on video games a human being has morals of what is right and wrong only people who are incredibly young or have a serious mental issue can look at something like GTA and believe that it is the right thing to do also humans have complex physicological mind we can not be sure if we are capable of murder until the option is put infront of us also for generations the point of play is to prepare us for war football and such games are directly linked into the origins of teaching children how to fight (usually tactics and basic rules of war in football's case) a game of tag teaches about the fight or flight part of dealing with a situation in that case flight although I can think of many times I've punched the person who's ""it"" out of blind panic and instincts and the actual fighting standpoint can come from mature video games (the more realistic ones) or roughhousing with your brother or friend one more serious and tactical the other is the early training of survival and is more close combat /brawling sort of style."
26466,"well, you know fox news theres no need to say something else"
26467,"I despise when the media tries to blame video games for the actions of some idiotic or mentally unstable person.
It's just the hip new thing to blame. It was Heavy Metal and Rock in the 70's and 80's. Now it's video games."
26468,Portal 2 adoption controversy
26469,"Australia does have Saint's Row 4, it's just been given the R rating and somewhat censored."
26470,Wow....People on the news and shit are pussies
26471,I've seen a small cutscene of Manhunt and I would peronally never play that kind of game.
26472,"number 1 makes may day america needs a scapegoat for there gun law where evrry one can get a gun and go shoot up a school
take eu no one here has schot up a school you know why were not inbred"
26473,the punisher....i think this game should have a spot
26474,This is insane these reporters are dumb for blaming video games. Games are for entertainment they are used to entertain you when your bored and thats it.
26475,To say Pokemon worships the devil is sinful.
26476,"The no Russian mission in COD though. I just didnt shoot until I was attacked honestly speaking, if it was up to me, no one would've been shot anyway. Also, doesn't mass shooting usually go back to bullying, home problems, or a mental illness?"
26477,call of duty was the one that pissed me off the most.
26478,"Pro tip: sports make way more dangerous than any videogame could ever do, because of the immense levels of testosterone and physical might, the anti videogames thing is just old people hating on things they don't like, like, if I was God I would ban football and curly hair to hell"
26479,"What is wrong whit being satanic? We can believe whatever we want, if Christians whant to fight to death whit me then grab your balls like Muslims do if you have any."
26480,3:48 KIM! :D
26481,"F the media video games don't affect anyone.Video games are just an escape.Thats like saying if I play Mario I'm gonna go stop on turtles
Dumb"
26482,"I dunno bout anyone else but if it weren't for ""violent"" video games being available to take my anger out on I would have lost my mind and been in prison by now..  people just want something to blame for those shooting.. and the most obvious choice is violent tv and games."
26483,"LOL... Please Ignor the Total Carnage behind the reporter that is 1000x more violent than MK lol.... but hey,,,, ITS MIDWAY !!!!"
26484,people really need to keep their mouths shut and mind their own fucking business especially reporters who are too ignorant to actually play the game or actually try to understand that it is virtual not real.
26485,the lady at the end who said they have mental illness has hit the nail on the head! People jump on a bandwagon and say what every one else says they never go through the background of the person in question!
26486,And Postal?
26487,"Just some extra information: The German rating system is very similar to the Australian system. A lot of violent games are cut to be released as 18+ or 16+ in Germany. In Modern Warfare 2 for example you are not allowed to shoot civilians. If you do, you lose."
26488,"There is a game in limbo right now because the developers wanted to make the environments so realistic, they went to non-(top)-secret military sites in Greece to take photos from a distance, and were subsequently arrested for espionage. The kicker is that the site they went to is visible and unclassified to view on Google Earth, which means any terrorist can see the base using said tool, and not have to fly there and take photos."
26489,games in my opinion have no relation to mass shooting we have those games in the uk but people dont go on mass shooting becuase there are no guns. EUREKA!
26490,that reporter at 5:33 didnt even give the guy a chance to defend himself
26491,y no 720p its 2014
26492,a minor controversy was medal of honor the modern one that came out in 2008 (or around that time) people were mad because in the online you could play as the taliban or another middle eastern group and fight us special forces
26493,"Why don't so called ""News teams"" get their facts right before feeding total bullshit to people that know nothing of the matter so they automatically agree with the bullshit there force fed. Bad journalism."
26494,Gta v
26495,"Personally I hate it when people blame video games for shootings and other murders, because it's only a selected few that aren't right in the head that re-create crimes from video games"
26496,"If people want to buy these games, let them buy these games. It's their choice."
26497,I thought maybe Rockstar's Bully should of been on the list. I can remember the schools calling all the parents to warn them about it and telling them not to buy it.
26498,"No wonder Fox News is considered stupid in popular culture, they are the epitome in everything bad about mass media."
26499,"Motherfuckers, get over it. Its a fucking game..."
26500,Fuck these old folk
26501,"In no russian you are by no means forced to kill any civilians, you can easily just walk on by and only kill the enemy police officers instead of any civilians"
26502,May fox news crash and burn.
26503,"All of this is such bullshit. Being an avid gamer, I have to admit, video games are violent, yeah. That's what makes them so fucking awesome! However, I'm not actually a violent individual. I've never purposely hurt another person. It's because I was taught. You know, by mo mother, that violence is unacceptable, and shall not be tolerated. It's not the game maker's fault. It's the parents. If you don't like what your kid is playing, then return the game while they're at school or something! DON'T JUST BITCH ABOUT IT AND FORCE THE DEVELOPERS TO CHANGE IT!!!!!! Actually take fucking responsibility for your child. Video games aren't to blame for violence, stupid people are. People who didn't raise their children right are. I don't blame the mentally ill, they can't help what has been done to them or their condition, I blame whoever is supposed to be looking after them! IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO USE YOUR FUCKING BRAIN AND ACTUALLY RAISE YOUR CHILDREN INSTEAD OF BUYING A 250$+ BABYSITTER!!!!!!! Parents nowadays man..."
26504,"most of the bullshit is brought on by fox news, you know FOX news as in fox 20th century's sister company. The movie branch produces R rated violent flicks and fox news doesn't get on their stupid soap box to spew lies about them, typical hypocrites."
26505,Ban guns not games!
26506,And has anyone noticed a lot of the news channels shown were FOX?
26507,"Just gonna say this out loud, that ""First Person Shooter Video Games lead to REAL Violence"" claim is complete bullshit. I think I can speak for all of us gamers that the only people retarted enough to do that in real life are mentally insane people or just complete and utterly retarted people."
26508,ooo I didn't expect to see Kim here (talking whit SR4)
26509,Missed Duke Nukem
26510,i don't even know how to buy a gun
26511,"People would rather blame a video game, or television, saying that ""because of these things, kids have no grasp of what is real and what isn't and think it's just a game"" NO, that is just you being a terrible parent that doesn't know how to raise their child. I used to play CoD, CS, Battlefield, and so many other games, I was raised watching Arnold blow shit up, if this was true, wouldn't I have done something by now? Parents are to blame, and thats that."
26512,3:26. What game is that ?
26513,Video Games don't make people violent......lag does
26514,Fox news is full of so much shit
26515,"Also, the games arent for kids, so why the shit storm?"
26516,"And movies and music are not violent? Most of the time it seems people are just too lazy to accept the fact that the guy/ kid could be ill, and want to have a quick fix, het some fking sense and post mortem the body, and review other things, like his ipod or film collection, if he was stressed or under pressure, just be fking bothered"
26517,Politicians is just fancy for FUCKING RETARDED INBREDS IN SUITS!
26518,Fox news more like Fucks up news.
26519,I thought mortal mom at would take the cake
26520,I'd rather have my son shoot up a bunch a simulated characters then real people
26521,"How the fucking hell is pokemon satanic? I remember playing super mario bros 3. One of the worlds, the levels are aranged in a fucking pentagram!"
26522,HEY!!!shut yp ok grand theft auto is the best game in history ok
26523,"There goes America again, worrying about stupid issues like violent video games rather than focusing on legitimate problems that actually do lead to violence."
26524,"And to be honest, who honestly believes in the crap on Fox News? (Sorry to Americans who do, of course this would be coming out of a Canadians thoughts.)"
26525,"My opinion is that people need to remember that they are only video games and the behaviour of kids could be partially inspired by video games but also the environment around them. Good examples would be how friends are acting at school or adults, famous people who they look up to, and finally the most important, parents actually controlling their kids. Just buying a game they know is bad but can't resist puppy eyes. Another thing, there is FAR scarier shit out there in the world. No need to worry about VIRTUAL violence."
26526,Also video games are a form of art. Just like books and movies. Do we freak out over violent or innapropriate books/movies as much as we do for video games? Nope! Older generations need to realize that video games are great things! They have taught and made me feel things things that books and movies never could.
26527,God people! Buck up! Our world now is full of wimps. If the game is too violent then here's an idea don't frikin play it! If something bad happens someone will find a way to blame it on video games.
26528,I killed this man because of....erm....Video games! That's right! Video games! And let's just blame the worlds crimes on video games! Genius freaking idea...
26529,Americans act like little shitty girls
26530,"It's seriously fucking stupid that a video game reaches congress because it's so violent. Really? Here's an idea, if you think it's to violent, THEN DON'T PLAY IT. People have the biggest fucking bitch fits over a game being ""To violent"" and there are so many extremely simple ways that a person with the IQ of a fucking brick can figure out. It's just so stupid. Sigh"
26531,Stupid Australia :(
26532,Battlefield4 being banned in China
26533,people just blame mass shootings on video games right away because they are too lazy to actually look deeper into the what could have actually caused it.
26534,Anyone else notice that a majority of the news clips were Fox News XD?
26535,I play 24/7 I'm still normal
26536,"Blaming video games for violence is about as logical as blaming guns for violence. With or without video games violence happens. Same things with firearms and ""gun control""."
26537,Just the fact that all of these news reporters don't even read the things about video games not doing anything to our minds because almost every video games is violent some more than others
26538,so they can't just ban gun sales to people who have mental issues the media just is trying to blame it on video games so this can keep on happing why not movies also or books at this point even music yet they chose video games
26539,"The only reason video games get all the blame for mass shootings is because the media needs something other than the gunman and the guns to blame, they overlook any other psychological facts, such as the environment the person grew up in, their behavioral record at school, camps, or any socially active environment. The only other thing that is an easy and slightly understandable scapegoat is did the assailant play 50 hours of GTA, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Halo, and Doom every week? If so what did he do when he played? Where did he play it? Most of if not all of my video games are violent, and or semi-violent, and I don't go to my school and shoot it up, in fact 99% of people who play the games, are NOT fucking homicidal maniacs who will play GTA the night before a school week, and shoot it up. The children are born with this idea of killing set in their mind, if video games truly led to violent behaviors then half of the world would be feral, violent, maniacal animals chomping at the bits to kill someone. Video games especially action/war ones DO have an affect on you however, the fast paced, adrenaline rushing feeling when you have five cop cars on your ass in GTA, and doing something badass like diving out of the car and shooting down all the cars with an RPG is FUCKING EXCITING, RIGHT!? Well you're damn right it is, it leaves you feeling accomplished and happy, but lets say you play for another two hours, what happens when you get off and got to bed? And answer to yourself truthfully, you can't sleep right, right? It's cause(and I learned this from my psychologist) the body just commited a high energy, high adrenaline action, and you're craving more, no time to go to sleep, no time to eat, I HAVE to play one or two more hours of Left 4 Dead, or beat this challenge on Red Dead Redemption, or kill this Clicker in The Last of US. Don't get me wrong, I fucking LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE video games. In the total of the 16 games I own on Steam, I have a total of about 1,000 hours played, and ass the hours of video games on my PS3 and Xbox, I've probably played about 3,000 hours of video games in my life.... and I'm only 14. The point is, video games DO NOT make you a killer, it makes a madman a killer, it fuels the thought of hey, tomorrow, I'm gonna ruin and end the lives of 15, 20, 30 people. Video games are NOT the reason people turn violent, people are the reason."
26540,"I find video games to be a healthy outlet, meaning that whatever sort of built-up stress has been accumulated for whatever reason, it was easy for me to take it out on non-existent characters in a non-existent world. In fact, during the mid 1990's all the way to early 2000, crime rates have dropped drastically.
Plus, this wouldn't be the first time a certain type of media entertainment was blamed for someone's actions. Movies and music (even what people wore as clothes)were also blamed for ""bad behavior"" and ""immoral decisions"". Those people that committed these crimes were either mentally ill (there's no way to tell for certain how or why just yet), under extreme stress, or in a life threatening situation.
So overall... the entertainment media isn't to blame... it's the people that put other people in the situations they are (or were) in. When you look at your ADD son or any kid of yours that ""acts out of the norm""... take a good look in the mirror, you self-proclaimed ""professional parent""."
26541,all the crap off this list and more pisses me off if a person has mental illness then there family are the people to blame for leting them play the games not the games themselfs
26542,"It's easy. If you don't want your kids to play M rated games, don't buy the games for them. My parents wouldn't let me play anything rated M until I was 17, the age where I could buy them myself. The issue with ""children"" playing games with adult themes in them falls completely under bad parenting."
26543,"The alleged Blasphemy in Pokemon really brought my piss to a boil, mainly because of how stupid the claim was. (INMYPERSONALOPINION)"
26544,ironicly number 10 is the real reason i even got mass effect 1 and got into the series i had to know if this company had the balls to throw in this most realistic sex scene however it proved wrong but the game was so dam good i did not even care
26545,No games piss me off I think if your going to get mad than get mad at the real thing don't hide behind a video game
26546,I don't know why there's so much bickering about video games being the reason for mass murders! It's pretty freaking easy to understand that you just SHOULDN'T LET PEOPLE WHO ARE MENTALLY UNSOUND USE A FIRE ARM.
26547,"The news media are pretty much bullshit and full of propaganda. They're just looking for something to talk about and bash. Just wish they'd be smarter. Instead of bringing up the same topic time and again, they should do some real research. That'd make their channel more media-worthy. If videogames do cause people to turn violent, then shouldn't I be out there killing people, jacking cars and blowing stuff up right now? I agree that the contents within a videogame should have restrictions, but people should really be more realistic when attempting to point their fingers at videogames for every mass murders or shootings that occur."
26548,Fuck me I reaaaaheeeheeeaaally hate Fox News. They are the perfect example of TERRIBLE journalism.
26549,"That last one is bs, I'm 12 and I play call of duty and grand theft auto and I have no temptation to take a gun and shoot people"
26550,Video games are modern day's comic books. Comic books also had violence imagery in them as well
26551,Sounds like Seth Rogan at 3:41 lol
26552,I wish people would stop blaming video games for bad things. Ugh.
26553,places like Gamestop should start making sure that people have everything right with them and no mental illnesses
26554,"fuck the government, fuck PETA and fuck Fox news"
26555,So I guess that means I can go trash a motel/hotel room and blame Guitar Hero ? Playing any game doesn't make me the character from the game.
26556,"stupid fucking over sensitive conservatives. ""QUICK, DISTRACT PEOPLE FROM GUN CONTROL, BLAME VIDEO GAMES!!!!"""
26557,all this video reminds me is how bigot the american media is.
26558,If someone has thoughts of mudering someone means they were insane to begin with
26559,"The violence has been a part of mankind since the beginning, be it through Creationism, Evolution or any other possibilities that mankind began. So putting the blame on these violent occurrences on video games seems so petty. What about violent films? I could be wrong but I don't see them getting any blame? Sure, video games are more interactive than a movies but it can still apply. Video Games don't kill people, people kill people. You know what would help reduce these shootouts at schools, colleges and universities? Repealing the 2nd Amendment."
26560,"I personally love violent movies and video games and never understand why people don't. I love realism in a game or where a game even goofie funny ones seem real because of the violence. I love feeling emotionally attached to a game and a character. Like in MW2 when you do that mission it makes it so much more real, it hits home and makes me think that, stuff like that happens. It makes the game as real as possible without killing innocent people. And isn't that the reason people play and make movies and video games; to see into the eyes of another character in another situation in another world maybe. Thats why I play video games for the purpose of having fun and enjoying myself. Thats why it really urks me on when people believe that because I play a fictional video game I'm going to commit a mass shooting. If as many people committed mass shootings as people who played the mission ""No Russian"" there wouldn't be any people on earth. I cannot stand when people don't face the true facts that there is a scary world out there and they can't hide from it and banning certain video games over their own fear of the world is purely ignorant and in my opinion stupid."
26561,I think the ones that pissed me off the most were the GTA controversies. I will not go into it on why cause I would be rambling for hours so I will make it short and to the point. Parents were stupid enough not to see what was in the game before they purchased it for their children.
26562,"This is what I LOVE about YouTube. Reading all the comments from ""kids"" like the ones that play these violent video games....nobody has ANY manners anymore, but instead of actually killing people, they just come on here and take out their frustrations on each other!! I LOVE IT!! Such a peaceful world we live in!!"
26563,"every time I exit an elevator I always say ""remember no russian"" xD"
26564,"As a gamer, I have personally never understood the reasoning behind people who think that video games are the cause of mass shootings or violence in general. I can happily play GTA, Mortal Kombat, (insert any violent video game here) for an extended period of time and then go on about my business and be a functional human being that contributes to society. The only thing I can say is ""Fuck you Fox News, fuck you"""
26565,lol.... every body dies anyway
26566,If a person is mentally stable the games won't effect them. They will realize it just a game.
26567,"I knew ""Take no russian"" would be on the list. That was the most disturbing moment i've seen in video game history. If you can honestly say you played through that mission without cringing, then you have something wrong with you. That mission took it too far & im shocked that game passed with it included. I for one couldn't even watch it for more than 2 seconds. I even had to skip through the countdown to pass it. Horrifying."
26568,They can JUST STFU? lol
26569,What background music is this? It's epic
26570,"I find it so stupid that just because they played video games, its the the main thing to blame..... Thats so retarded"
26571,"This annoys me because of how these Americans blame games when people do mass shooting. In the UK we play the same game as Americans but you do not here mass shootings stories that go on here in the UK. it is because of people selling guns with out checking their back ground or selling to the mentally disturbed, plus good video."

26584,"Ohhh number one is so ture. When someone says this I can just laug. Here is a funfact: The first books writen in the ego-perspektive were also in controversies. I think its all just the hate against the ""new media"". First the book (or at least the perspektive) and now the Video-games. I would bet the next medium (hopfully sometinhg like Virtualy Realyity) will be hated too."
26585,"Of course, all the wars in the world were caused by violent video games

26612,like this comment if you hate fox news for its bull crap about video games and other stuff that fits in that category. I what to see how many people hate it.
26613,The last news story about violent video games is such bullshit those people who killed innocent bystanders are insane and the people who say guns should be banned in the US that will make no difference these people will smuggle them into the country or use something else to kill and hurt other people

I have violent thoughts and anger issues do to a hormonal imbalance, not because i shoot zombies and save ficticious lands from the bad guys. Hell its a fun challenge trying to snipe someone in tombrader when the engine isnt designed for it. Or... Hell, carpets of bodies in assassins creed.

26666,"I have always found a majority of the controversy utter bull, me and my siblings grew up playing GTA and Mortal Kombat, and we have not don't any of the things shown in the games. That's not to say some people, who alright had violet thoughts may not have taken idea's from games, but saying a violent people are the result of violent games is like saying drug use is the result of pacman.
If a person wants to do those acts it's not down to a game or a movie, but down to an individual. And if your worried about your child becoming violent due to a game, you need to have more faith that you've raised them right, not that they are going to steal a car because in a game you can."
26667,"Pokemon teaches how to cast spells and perform witchcraft? Yeah, it's not like you battle with Pokemon as your friends, teaming up in battle to become stronger and become the well-respected champion of the region or anything. You obviously perform satanic spells and kill innocent people and creatures. I can see CONCERNS with Jynx's design and maybe animal abuse, (which are still completely ridiculous) but Witchcraft??? That has nothing to do with Pokemon at all. This shows how the old idiots that say this stuff literally have ZERO knowledge on what actually happens in games and are just trying to blame everything wrong with society on something that they don't care about, so if it actually does stop, they don't lose anything. It pisses me off that they resort to making stuff up. And the gambling? Nothing on Mario Party, or any game in existence that has minigames? Makes no sense..."
26668,Those people that you just want to shut up.
26669,Gears of War wasn't on this wow
26670,And one of the only things I don't agree with conservatives on is all this video game violence bullshit.
26671,"Terrible parents blaming games for their terrible parenting.  That's what so much of this is about.  Games like GTA and CoD specifically have M ratings.  A parent should know better than to expose their child to material recommended for adults.  Also, I'm no psychiatrist, but I would think that violent games would better act as OUTLETS for a person's rage than the cause.  But again, that's my theory."
26672,I have manhunt 2 for PC.
26673,The raising of the rating (at number 2) from Mature to Adult is probably the most sensible reaction against video games I've seen.
26674,WHITE PEOPLE SMH BOY I TELL YA ALWAYS TRIPPING
26675,Every single one it's just a ducking game
26676,"In conclusion, don't pass blame on games if you've never played one in your life."
26677,"Actually, you can buy all those games in Australia. The laws exist, but they're not enforced. We also don't have freedom of speech."
26678,"I dont know why the hell people bitch over video games making their children violent...
Perhaps if they had half a brain and an ounce of responsibility, they would not get their children those video games but clearly since most parents don't give a shit and just want their children to be distracted so they aren't bothering them, they don't do anything about it."
26679,Only FOX News would hop on something like that. :/
26680,"If video games make people just get up in the morning and say ""Hey, I feel like shooting up a school!"", than why do so very, extremely little of the tens of millions of gamers around the world actually do it?"
26681,"I remember playing Modern Warfare 2 at my cousin's house. I got to ""No Russians"" and was completely confused at what I was doing. Then we started to mow down the crowd and I just suddenly thought ""What in the actual fuck am I doing?!""
Never touched that game since.
Never."
26682,i have Manhunt 2 on my PSP and Carmogeddon on PSone plus i got MK9 from ebay on Asian region when it first came out..and i am from Australia. that South Australian senator can go and fuck himself
26683,The MW2 shooting mission is very disturbing.
26684,background music? in start? please
26685,Fuckin' Fox News...
26686,There's Kim in your video!!!! oh my god!!!! :D :D
26687,Video games dont make kids violent lag does
26688,LOL what was thinkin when they did the CoD part... mindless shoting down ppl in a airport :L ... herp derp
26689,"Questions I got:
1) Why do people bitch about Fallujah even if there are games about way more terrible things?
2) Why do people bitch about Manhunt? It's brutal? What kind of 'bad' influence does that have?
3) Mass shootings? More people have died from lightning strikes and shark attacks or religious and financial issues than there have ever been from someone playing games. If games even had to do anything with it.
4) Doesn't the government have anything better to do?"
26690,"the news complaining about games can just go fuck themselves, its a game, there is zero evidence that anybody has killed due to suggestions from video games, more people have been killed by books"
26691,Also why are video games with guns always too blame what ever happened too crazy
26692,If you are really against games like that just don't get them for your kids or yourself and shut up
26693,"sometimes people can be fucking idiots, video games don't cause violence ffs"
26694,Fuck every tofu fartin' fairy that says violent games lead to real life violence
26695,but the reason they blame video games is maybe becuse so many play videogames?
26696,"To the tools griping about fox and to the maker of this video, try not being an idiot and doing some research. Not only conservative news channels attack games. Video games are attacked by every major news media outlet in this country. Not only by the media but also by politicians of which I have seen plenty of liberal politicians denounce video game violence and try to ban them.."
26697,Why are these parents blaming the games? It's the parents that fucken let them play.. Dumb fucks.
26698,"U guys should make top ten sport retiring injuries, and top ten athletes band from sports, would be awsome ,top ten underated people too"
26699,"Thank You COD. Without you guys blowing the doors off with ""No Russian"" who knows how many more games would be getting scrutinized. Now it would take a 3 headed antichrist spewing communist idiology while wearing a woman's skin killing Santa Claus to get attention.
From nazi zombies to Vilifying Russia, You guys really work hard at lowering the bar. I Love You For It."
26700,Obviously it would be Fox news to say video games cause physiological problems in kids and making them want to kill
26701,I've done a literalproject on#1!
26702,lol wut? xDDD the preacher's knowledge of pokemon. xDD
26703,what was they video game at 3:26
26704,"I play pokemon, I'm Christian, and I Have never been influenced negatively by them"
26705,don't blame fucked up video games! Blame the fucked up people playing them.
26706,My local news channel was featured twice XD
26707,I grew up with mw2 stfu
26708,"I think the Call of Fallujah shouldn't have been pulled..people make war movies telling the stories of soliders lost in battle and thats seen as tasteful and respectful, but when you make a video game about it it's seen as disrespect and in poor taste? I don't understand it"
26709,I feel like Mortal Kombat should have been slightly higher since its what created the ESRB..without that I would have had to wait 17 years to go to gamestop alone to buy a fucking game
26710,suprised resident evil wasnt on this list
26711,"Hay it's the dame  parents who let there kids play violent games like GTA and Call of Duty.
Happy new years everybody! :)"
26712,Goddamn every person which says shooters make massacers are dumb bcause 1. Theyve never played one 2. The guys are upset or just psychological ill while they that 3. Studys found out that under 3% of the guys that are doing a massacer played 1st person shooters instantly or just sometimes
26713,PETA takes such immature extremes with their games. They react to Pokemon and Cooking Mama with violent and grotesque games. Really?
26714,and thats why i dont watch the news
26715,"i hated the. ""its because of games that people kill other people!"""
26716,"5:25 
Um how is that different than the many many many many many movies about war? What's wrong with having the ability to experience something so impact flu like war? That lady should've thought what she was trying to say before she made herself look like a complete ass whole over television. And don't even get me STARTED on the Pokemon conspiracy oh my god If I was in there while that guy was talking I would outright question if he was a fucking retard."
26717,Each and every one of those anti-gamer's words made me want topunch themin the face so many timesmy hand wouldbreak.
26718,"Why is all this even on any news networks. Why do people need to know that a certain video game is violent, there is a rating on the case."
26719,"I do not believe that video games are bad, it always depends on the people playing it and how impressionable they are. If a parent know their kids take many things seriously then they should NOT buy them certain games. The only people to blame are the parents."
26720,"I do not believe that video games are bad, it always depends on the people playing it and how impressionable they are. If a parent know their kids take many things seriously then they should NOT buy them certain games. The only people to blame are the parents."
26721,What did people claim mass shooting and drug abuse and alcohol  addictions on before video games
26722,"I hate to be the guy who points out the little areas of error or the other guy who said the same exact thing someone else said, but Manhunt 2 is NOT a game solely about killing. You escape a mental institution and you have to find out about the gaps in your memory, who were you and how you ended up in the asylum. Manhunt 1 was solely about killing and even then, the guy who saved you from execution is the director of a Snuff film. Now I'm thinking that it wasn't such a small error."
26723,Don't people get video games there fake and scripted its like a movie but your the character who can't do those thing in real life
26724,Fucking Jake Thompson.....
26725,It's not video games that kill people(ignoring the fact that you DIE in video games so that would be a deterrent from trying to replicate a game like GTA in the first place)it's bad parenting and mental illnesses COMBINED with mature video games. Mature being the key word
26726,"For a second I though this list will mention something about Columbine, because some shooting games that Klebald and Harris played were blamed for this"
26727,One: one of the main news channels shown was FOX (a really bad one) and VIRTUAL shooters  are not the cause of REAL shootings. Just another dumb excuse for republicans to hide the real cause which is their limits on guns. Oh wait! There isn't any!
26728,"If people blame games for violence, then you have to look at music and movies and videos and even books too. There are more things to loo at than just games. Saw is a perfect example of violence and blood. Then there's Goosebumps, and Braveheart too. A lot of music contains explicit content and 'dirty' talk, which people could argue that it could possibly influence people."
26729,its just video games oh my god
26730,saying that video games cause shootings is saying that Mario gives you the urge to jump on turtles
26731,"There's more blood and guts in PG13 movie than rated R ones, so how are video games the only things being blamed?"
26732,YOU FORGOT WOLFENSTEIN
26733,"gta should have gotten #3
and Wolfenstein should have gotten #2"
26734,"#3 is not brainer really, if the game developers themselves give you choice to skip a mission for its content then you know the contrives will be big"
26735,"I love it. In Australia you can get killed hundreds of different ways by nature, but God forbid if you play a violent video game (Note: I live in Adelaide, Australia which has the highest murder rate per head of population)."
26736,I'd love to think that if films had been created yesterday. they would have the same issues as games have now. Conservatives will die out and there wont be any more controversy
26737,"I was told to write a paper on ""something controversial"" in a college English class, and my teacher denied my idea to write one on violence in video games being blamed for killings. She wanted me to write ""something you can relate to more"" like flag burning or cross burning... I quit the class the next day."
26738,"I will admit video game violence can desensitize a person to violence if they can't tell reality from the game. Not really a CoD fan, but I love MK because of the creativity of some Fatalities. If you want kids to not play M-rated games, tell the parents to monitor their children. I do understand the need for ratings systems (like the MPAA's, ESRB's, FCC's, etc.), but it falls to the parents of the children to just say ""NO!""
And as a Christian myself, I've heard all the arguments against Pokemon, Harry Potter, Yu-Gi-Oh!, et. al. promoting witchcraft, demon worship, and/or satanism. Hell, my parents in the past hated me playing ALttP because it speaks of the Golden Goddesses. But I digress. People will always find a scapegoat for the problems; it's a shame today's gamers are seen as tomorrow's serial killers."
26739,They always have to find something to blame. It's just human nature sadly.
26740,It's stupid. Only people with weak minds would be convinced by a video game to do something like that.
26741,"If you have no ideas, just shut the fuck up media. Pokmon is haunted to be sartasm or anything else since this bullshit...."
26742,"I just want to punch something every time one of those self-righteous Fox News morons starts getting high and mighty over something that shouldn't be an issue. Worried about kids playing violent games? Ok then, grow a pair and be a friggin parent and say ""no."" I don't see why developers should have to censor their stuff to protect the kiddies when the parents could just do their jobs and tell the kids not to play that because it's for adults.
If kids are playing GTA V, who's fault is that? The developers who made the game intending for ADULTS to play it? The ESRB for properly labeling the game M for mature? Retailers for denying to sell the game to minors? Or yours for letting your 12 year old play a game that doesn't even try and be shy about the fact that it's all about ridiculously violent action? If news outlets should be blaming anybody, it's the parents. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that most problems with our youth today can be traced back to terrible parenting.
But on top of that, video game violence does not have an effect on anyone who isn't a mental patient. Look up the Jimquisition episode on video game violence, he makes the point much better than I could."
26743,PETA is without a doubt one of the dumbest organizations I have ever heard of lol. How is making a flash game about the fake abuse of fictional animals in a kids video game a suitable use of anyone's time and resources?
26744,"okay
1) its a video game
2) get over it
3) a GAME is not to blame cause people lose their minds
4) the violent acts people commit aren't because something they played in a game, its because they acted on their violent tendencies"
26745,Who was the advocate in Florida?
26746,i just love how 90% of all the news storys are from fox news lol
26747,Mw2 was bad but u don't have to shoot the people
26748,Fucking Fox News...
26749,"Gun have never killed anyone by themselves. Its the person behind the trigger who is to blame, Not some fictional scenario in a video game."
26750,lol guess its easier to blame the video games rather than the parents
26751,The call of duty scene actually was kind of disturbing.
26752,"Is tomb raider on here for the ""rape"" scene."
26753,Video games r not the problem because now we have a lower crime rate thanks to video games and now u can do anything at home like rob a virtual store
26754,Fox news is just annoying
26755,think of the children............ima smack you up
26756,"Guns don't kill people, neither do drugs, BUT VIDEOGAMES DO!!! (Sarcasm)"
26757,"The only one that actually caused me to stop playing was MW2....
When I think about it it's disturbing because it's so real and I know that sorta shit happens and I just didn't want to think of it. Plus that scene just came out of no where with little warning. My initial reaction to that mission was to shoot the terrorists... but then my cover was blown and I just couldn't fucking play anymore and felt kinda depressed.
Other than that no game really ever seems to disturb me... It's mostly the part in CoD storylines where they throw it in your face that this is the sorta shit that's happening and they do so in such graphic detail. Mortal Kombat is cheesy, gory, but cheesy. GTA isn't so bad either... they're so extreme and far fetched it comes off as more artistic and unrealistic and doesn't make you think of all the horrors in the world and the reasons why this planet sucks so much dick. At least not for me.
I guess the news is just as disturbing because they're promoting fear and ignorance and CoD is for the most part just showing you the sorta shit that actually happens [a little exaggerated when it comes to situations, but still some fucked up shit goes down in this world]. GTA is too much of a satire to take seriously in terms of ""This is how things happen.""... meh... I don't know I don't really wanna think about MW2... it sits on a shelf in my house somewhere and collects dust. I've never made it past that mission [or even bothered to skip and see what else happens in the game].
Still the news takes the fucking cake... cause fuck the news."
26758,Fox news should change their name to FOS news. Full of Shit news
26759,"Speaking of #9, Kadabra obviously has a star and not a pentagram on it's forehead."
26760,Video games dont kill people. People kill people.
26761,"Congress. Still proving that we need rich, old, white hypocrites to tell us what is appropriate entertainment."
26762,"Pokemon controversy seems a little bit stupid and people are looking a bit too deeply into it. The games/TV show promote friendship between player/trainer and Pokemon, and the 'gambling' is just a little mini game, and I doubt players will start gambling in real life just because of that. The Grand Theft Auto controversy is much more understandable, but it could also be seen as a way of people being allowed to be violent without having to hurt people in real life.
I can see why people can argue that video games make people more violent, but if you compare today with, say, Ancient Rome, you can see that we are actually less violent."
26763,"every single game that has killing in it, because people are like ""oh that game makes kids kill"" no its a video game. its post let you do stuff what you can't do in real life. and if they make video games with no action at all. they would be just boring as hell."
26764,"You can't say video games aren't the cause, of course normal people wouldn't do this shit but when someone with some form of mental illness witnesses this shit the can't help but be inspired by it like a little boy that loves superman and wears a towel as a cape."
26765,"It doesnt matter what people say, the ""no russian"" mission is freaking awesome."
26766,"As soon as somebody sees somehing they don't like in a videogame the media blows up saying ""THUR TRYIN TEW CURRUPT OWR CHEELDRIN"" (Translation) THEY'RE TRYING TO CORRUPT OUR CHILDREN"
26767,Let blame games and not us as the people who teach them how to use this things video game are which burn them burn them in the head of a no brain new man
26768,Payday2?
26769,"fox new, jack thompson and everyone that are against video games you can go fuck yourself"
26770,"Is all bullshit, bich be crazy with or without violent games"
26771,battlefield 3 got sued by PETA
26772,Do top ten deaths o horror villains like chucky Freddy Jason
26773,7:02 then again so is the hunger games
26774,Top 10 porn stars?
26775,"Ok I play cod, bf4 and gta. These games are based around guns, I don't go running around with a gun killing people in real life. I actually know that video games aren't real and you can't go around killing ppl. These retards on the news think they are hot shit because they can say a guy killed someone because he plays grand theft auto. That guy is either mentally sick or a fucking retard."
26776,"you guys completely forgot about ""POSTAL"" i honestly think that game is the worse since the whole objective is to kill people and mass murder. you can put a cat on your gun and shoot through it for a silencer for krist sakes. to me that game crossed a lot of lines."
26777,"Pokemon? Witchcraft? Spells?
When is ""Tackle"" or ""Scratch"" a spell?"
26778,"Actually, for the Pokmon one. It is pretty clear that you do abuse the Pokmon, soooo. That one wasn't stupid."
26779,"OK,here's the story...
Last year,I think,a guy went up and shot a ton of people.I do not remember the guy's name,but I believe it was on an island.And the freaking news team said ""Well,he played WoW,it must have caused some sort of psychopathic illness...and I'm like ""WHAT DA FUQ"""
26780,so real sex isn't realistic?
26781,pokmons are demons ? who knew ? ok some are but all of them what the fuck ?
26782,"The only reason there was a controversy over Night Trap is the fact that you could actually kill Dana Plato who, even thought her TV career was pretty much over at the time, was still considered ""America's Sweetheart""."
26783,You know who kills people? People not video games
26784,My friend from sweden had a friend from childhood he killer 21 pepole and was sended to Norway
26785,Retards... Fucking retards... Controversies are the bane of progress... And not only contreversies.... All they want is money and attention....
26786,"Qu casualidad que todo sea en Estados Unidos, puede resultar hasta irnico. Australia y Nueva Zelanda se llevan la palma en cuanto a censura y prohibiciones, lo cual resulta risible, y ms todava que sea el gobierno el que decida qu juego est bien y cul est mal."
26787,Jack fucking Thompson
26788,Pokemon satanic pls
26789,"I play video games all the time. I don't go running into stranger's houses, talk to them for 5 seconds then break all their pots to look for money. I still don't know how to shoot a real bow or a gun. I'm not running across the country, trying to stop my demonic brother from destroying the human world or kill me. I don't go stealing cars, or even summoning giant creatures named after ancient gods and other deities. Reality: I'm sitting on my ass, playing video games and trying to contain my excitement for the new Godzilla movie. Now if you will excuse me. I need to grow into a giant, walking nuclear reactor and destroy Tokyo."
26790,"Mass Effect, after 40 hours of been nice with the woman that you hate... You deserve something nice XD"
26791,It is extremely disrespectful towards people that play eg. Call of Duty or Battlefield to accuse them of turning into mass-murdering dickweeds.
26792,"After watching this, I now realize how beyond idiotic, quick to judge, and attention beggers people really are. First bs they claim is that Pokemon is based on demonic creatures and animal abuse. That's a facepalm from the start because that's the most unintelligent thing I have ever heard. Then they go to blame video games for violence? Geez people just want attention so bad they have to blame stupid things for them. Did the video game get up and kill people? No the killer did. It doesn't inspire killing people, it is meant to entertain. Their maturity and thought of themselves is what makes them kill somebody. How are parents not having problems with kid toys of little babies shitting and pissing themselves. What about that Doggy Doo game that is about a dog taking a shit? Where is the fuss in that? People are just beyond stupid and just beg for attention in any way possible"
26793,and your reference is: FOX News!! :))
26794,Sevmek enguzel sey

26798,Ahhhh time to fire up Battlefield 3...
26799,"I love how the media says ""well, everyone who has committed a mass murder recently played violent video games"". Well, so do 100,000,000 other Americans who have never so much has aimed a gun at another person."
26800,So Video games are bad but movies are okay :-(
26801,"most violent video games have a restrictive content option to turn off some bloody or offensive content! So mabey poeple should look at how mass murderers get the guns in the first place?! If the laws against guns where stronger there would be less gun victims as there would be less avalible guns! Simple! But ,as an example, america won't do that because then the people that sent mentat loose out of something they enjoy. Mabey people should just see that guns have never done humans any good so mabeythe shouldn't be any? Wouldn't that make every one as equal as each other?  People are scared of what video games do to people but its just another steriotipical thing against them!"
26802,Manhunt 2 looks so fun but it's banned in the uk D:
26803,My son didn`t have that choice Oh shut up okay! I feel for your son but come on people! They`re just video games and they never killed anybody. Those giant massacre`s had nothing to do with video games. Those happened because the people who did made a conscious decision to doit. That`s the only reason that happened.But oh no the press had to pin it onvideo games for whatever reasons.
26804,I want to play that Pokemon game now...
26805,"I want to see the top ten cartoon/animie theme songs, and I nominate Dragon Ball z/ki and RWBY for the list."
26806,i wonder what people blamed mass shootings andviolenceon before games?
26807,my stupid parents agreed with that stupid pokemon shit so icouldn'twatch till i was 9
26808,They should blame people with the ton of guns in a warehouse because they started the coterverse with fps
26809,Why is Fox News even a thing
26810,Any time fox news opens their mouths I get pissed off.
26811,"Let's blame the video games.
Fucking parents -_-"
26812,Nothing that gets me going more than Fox News trying to bring down the gaming industry with their shitty claims of violence in-game results in violence outside of the game.
26813,"#4(4:48) ""just sitting there laughing when they die or don't die when they die just saying lets restart"" average call of duty lets play and thank you it got on this lit"

26815,"Thank you for agreeing with over 500,000 Teens/Kids by saying it was BOGUS"
26816,The guy 5:10 died on my birthday R.I.P
26817,just about each entry on the list featured a soundbyte from fox news. no surprise that conservitards like them will jump at the opportunity to blame anything on video games. they sure do love a good scapegoat on that network.
26818,All we really gleam from this vid is how backward Yanks are.

And you would think your ""god"" would have some sense to prevent those types of things from happening video game related or not."
26822,Whuddabout Ethnic Cleansing/Postal 2?
26823,why is it mostly fox news?
26824,"if your call a video game ""controversial"" just because the fox complain about it.... it's gonna be easy to find well more"
26825,So conservatives blame media and liberals blame the guns themselves...
26826,C'mon they're just games
26827,"The blaming of mass shootings on video games never fails to piss me off. Shooting a gun in real life is hard. There are multiple things to take into account (recoil, wind speed, wind direction, ricochet, etc.), that's a hell of a lot harder than pushing a button on a controller or keyboard. And hey, maybe if more research was put into the treatment of mental illness, then there wouldn't be so many mass shootings. Just a thought."
26828,This is bullshit!
26829,We can all just agree that all people that oppose video games are dicks

26834,"lol i always love watching theses newscasters attempt to blame games for violence
and 90% of them dont even know what they're talking about when they make these accusations."
26835,Why mw2 it i just a video game
26836,I feel like people over the age of 30 should not be allowed to talk about if games change the way a person thinks when they've never actually done it themselves
26837,I hate that we get stick for playing video games that include some badfeatures but these game can also give you skills. I have played every assassins creed and when I went to a training course built exclusively for freerunning or parkour I could fly around it like if someone was walking and just the other day I went to my first firing range and stripped down the put back together and assault rifle. if I can download skills like these into my head then does that mean that I cant help people by using skills from games
26838,Number 1 was so true.  Anyone who thinks that video games leads to mass shootings is just looking for an excuse so that they can seem intelligent.  It does not.
26839,look people will never stop blaming video games for violence. the other day I turned on the news and there was a story about super Mario being violent...
26840,Ya That Is Weird People Get Shot At some Place Media Blames A Shooter Game Like WTF They ArePsychopaths Its not Some Game thatDrove that guy to A Shooting
26841,Is it bsd that I want to play pokemon black and blue after watching this...
26842,The reason that war game was canned is because like generation kill was also canned because America didn't like how it made them look bad
26843,If I was to develop a video game like 30 days in faluga (hope I spelled it right) and it started getting controversy like 30 days got I would have said fuck it and went on ahead
26844,god i hate fox news
26845,All I know video games teaches me a lot of things...
26846,"I can see how some of these controversies are justified. I just hate the fact that whenever there is a tragic shooting event in real life, video games are often always the blame. In the case of video games having bad effects on children, the rating for a video game is on the cover! It's the parents responsibility that they are monitoring there child's gameplay to make sure it's appropriate. People think that violence nowadays stems from increases in video game use. Well if you look back hundreds of years, the human race was much more violent than it is today. The human race was much more violent long before video games even existed."
26847,If you say games make people kill others then humans would be extinct. People just need to blame something so the blame it on the violent games.
26848,Fox news pls
26849,How many others thought video games cause violence is just really stupid??
26850,conservatives are crazy....get out of my guns but monitor how many hours people play on video games and what games they buy.
26851,"Can someone please answer!
What was that language learning commercial that says it's free from memorization and developed by scientists? I'm on a mobile divine and can't click on onscreen links.
Please help!
Thank you"
26852,How the ** is pokemon satanic?
26853,wow...surprsied no russian was not number one mowing down civilians tends to set off parents who bought the game for their kids cuz theyre shitty parents who don't read the RSB rating xD.
26854,"The six Days in Fallujah pissed me off because they should have released it, it was a big battle and it couldve be remembered more about the sacrifices soldiers made"
26855,Basically you either love video games or you hate them. I LOVE video games!! Nothing like the media getting all butthurt.
26856,This makes me so pissed that everything bad that happens in the world is blammed on violent video games and movies!
26857,FOX NEWS NEEDS TO SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!!
26858,haha fox sucks... so very much
26859,Pokemon is awesome
26860,You missed bonertown
26861,I'm surprised that Postal was not even mentioned
26862,"Heads up this is a rant so yeah....
jesus christ, the thing is that the previous/old generation are just being conservatives, doing all in there power to keep the old old, and we the newer/young generation want innovation and not to be stuck in this ""old"" time. BUT, what i can understand is their ""fear"" of shooting/war based games. They were the generation that went through WW1 and WW2. But what i want them to do is to look at WW2, it was caused by errmmm.... ""he who shall not be named"", he was trying to push his ""ideals"" onto those within Germany through lies, lies and more lies barely sprinkled with the truth, and guess what it worked, he got the whole of Germany under his wings and went to create a world with his ideals. So, how is this any different? Those with power or who are higher up in our community are attempting to spread lies barely sprinkled with the truth and bend us to the belief that video games or any entertainment related to video games is bad, terrible, and can cause us to attempt homicide, mass destruction, etc... And then there are those who DID do those things and blamed it on video games. but what i want to ask is WHO IN THERE RIGHT MIND WOULD DO THAT BECAUSE OF VIDEO GAMES?! I'm sure you wouldn't, but the instance the criminal says this, those higher up in the community jump onto that and scream ""SEE VIDEO GAMES ARE BAD"" without bothering to check to see if there was another reason, such as family issues, love life issues or just mental issues. In fact, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that the previous/older generation are narrow minded as hell and refuse to look at things in the big picture or just from a different perspective.
And for those who actually read through this entire thing, congrats and <3"
26863,"Glad that I live in Denmark. Games can get up to an+16. Thats it. The only ones who protest are a few religious people, but they don't have any power in Denmark."
26864,"I think Bully should be on this list,arguably in the top 5. That game cause a hell of a lot of controversy before it was released from court cases being filed to ban it in USA, the game having to change its name for UK release, where one of the biggest electronics chain decided not to stock it and in Brazil where the game was banned and people would be fined if they were found to own the game."

26873,"Okay, Pokmon being a satanic witchcraft is, what you may call an ass load of bull shit. And hell it's magical elemental attacks not being stabbed in the chest and bleeding everywhere. AND you quite litterly take them to a specialized hospital!"
26874,Dear NSA before you sell my details to MI6 I'd like to tell you I'm joking about the mass murder thing
26875,"I tried to shoot up my school with a virtual gun I'll tell you It was not affective at all, if you want a mass killing done properly go for the real thing ........ Maybe try controlling REAL guns I'd like to point out that from across the pond it looks like America loves its guns more than its children I mean there have been 147 school shootings since 1990"
26876,postal. a totally unnecessary game. why does that game even exist?
26877,i know u all saying that the people is crazy without the video games which is right for the last 5000 years war only stopped 250 years where was video games then but that doesn't mean some of the games on this list is very violent so the video games makers should consider that it could be entertaining without all that graphic blood
26878,"Great video, but I'm surprised Mortal Kombat and Carmaggedon weren't higher on the list."
26879,Point me to a video considering borderlands offensive :D

26884,"I remember that after the massacre in Norway in 2011 the press blamed ""World of Warcraft"" to have helped the killer to improve his skills and to have shown him, how to use guns... honestly, I am not a WoW fan, but how the heck is WoW supposed to improve your shooting skills with guns?"
26885,ron paul 2012!
26886,embarassing... american media and government's reaction
26887,"Parents don't want to take responsibility for not spending time with their kids.... So they blame it on the games.... Don't buy them the game if u know it's bad... Spend more quality time with them, that's what leads to killings unloved kids, not kids who play violent video games"
26888,you can expect COD on here
26889,"jynx is based on the japanese Ganguro girls. not the black face racism shite, These top 10 lists are always bollix but yet i always watch them lol"
26890,What about the developers of Arma 3 getting locked up?!?! You know they're still in Greece? And Bohemia Interactive is still spending money trying to get them released.
26891,Oh my gosh guys from the news some of these are just games if people who had mental illnesses its there fault you can't just blame the games
26892,man hunt was the shit
26893,"Video games need a warning on the cover? The fucking ESRB rating is on the cover, that should be enough of a warning."
26894,thanks alot fox ur the big news site that oh games are bad well dont let mentally ill kids get to them
26895,You walk past 7 psychos a day. Most shooters or mass murderers are just fucking nuts
26896,"i hate how they always blame video games for mass shootings, and just ignore the fact that those Persons already had Mental Problems and were on anti depressants. which can lead to loss of reality.
i shoot hundreds of people in games everyday, but i don't even kill mosquitos in reality... :P"
26897,"Agreed, Leon."
26898,Has anyone else noticed that most of the news reports are from Fox News? WHAT DID FOX NEWS SAY?
26899,FUCK the people who think game kill people with a porequinine  up the ass!!!

26901,His name is jack Thompson JACK THOMPSON!!!!!!!!!!
26902,"This is one of your better lists however it's still the one which angers me the most.
It just shows how ignorant the media is and how that in turn corrupts the opinion of their viewers."
26903,"It is sad how people get so butt hurt over ""fantasy violence"" I am sorry but you are partaking in ""fantasy violence"" when you par-take in any form of violent media. Also the ME3 ending coulda been on here just because it still makes me sad... :""("
26904,We'd lose so much money if they banned video games.... so much
26905,Pokemon demonic lol ducking idiots
26906,"Ooh, you mean Jack Thompson?"
26907,Hi
26908,Its funny you don't have to shoot up the airport
26909,it feels like yesterday when I did that modern warfare 2 mission. good times
26910,"This is one of your finest lists, WatchMojo! Fantastic job as usual!"
26911,"The woman right at the end of the video hits the nail on the head - anyone who sits down and plays a FPS for a few days, then goes outside with a real gun and starts shooting at people, clearly has serious mental health issues. Playing FPS games does NOT lead people to go out and shoot people for real. When will the po-faced, right on section of the media get that through their thick skulls?"
26912,"i HATE things like this because resident evil has movies games and some books, they all bitch about how the games are too violent, when in the movies and books are violent as the game as well!!!!"
26913,"people are just way too fuckin' sensitive. reality is not pleasant, get used to it."
26914,People Is just being over-acting .. its just a game .. so don't take it too serious ~_~
26915,"Violent video games are not the cause for mass shootings. They are horrible events, but most if not all the shooters have mental illness"
26916,What video games were popular during The Crusades & The Spanish Inquisition? Exactly...
26917,...and of course the stupid Christians are gonna put in their 2 cents. Everything to those fuckin people is evil and satanic.
26918,"Does FIFA Soccer games make you a soccer star in real life? Does Madden make you a pro football player, does MLB 2K/MLB The Show make you a professional baseball player, in the game the answer is an obvious yes, but in real life no, granted some kids are very athletic and are baseball players or football players, etc. but playing these games won't make you what the game portrays, therefore why are shooter games blamed for every shooting? You should blame football games when people get hurt in football and the same for baseball. Plus with settings in the game you can do almost anything in football or baseball games to out score you opponent as much as you want. Every call of duty game I have gotten says at the main screen whether or not to have the violence, the message lets you know there is violence and allows you to turn the violence off. So shooter games don't make you a professional killer in real life so they should stop being blamed for every shooting"
26919,Why does everyone have to hate on Pokmon
26920,"@Usernamenotfound. Hi (Still not understanding how to reply with YouTube's ridiculous new settings). You know, I don't think I missed the point. I didn't say that video games cause violence. And it's presumptuous to assume that only people who are mentally unstable-- as if that were something you're born as-- can live out the violence that they pay so much attention to. The fact of the matter is that anybody can have a bad day. And my goodness, in this day and age, EVERYONE is a little mentally unstable! Again: who/what/how much we spend on a thing will bear it's fruit, whether it's someone getting thrills from verbal/physical/social abuse to outright gun violence. I invite you and others who support your comments to reread what I said, and you'll see that it doesn't just apply to ultra violent video games. Thanks for sharing your opinion. Peace."
26921,Its stupid when people say video games are makeing this world violent .yup because before video games the wold was peaceful
26922,The Gun laws in the us are to blame for these shootings not games!
26923,I did it I conquered gta 5
26924,"Its not the video games
its the bad parenting, maybe if parents spent time with their kids instead of filling their lives with electronics, they wouldnt grown up to be psychotic mass murderers"
26925,"If someone has a cell phone they're more likely to make a call or text, so if someone has gun they are more likely to shoot something or one... it's simple logic. Americans who are pro gun need to realise this and get of there high horses and stop saying it's apart of their culture."
26926,Battle in Fallujah looked awesome.
26927,No Russian mission in MW2 in my opinion was pretty f*** up.
26928,"I love violent video games,hell i even find Postal amusing, but I find that Manhunt 2, Manhunter,the No Russian mission of MW2, the Columbine Massacre game and the Kennedy assassination simulation to be in horrible taste."
26929,I like how fox news is in every controversy t.v. scene in this list
26930,i knew no russian MW2 would be here
26931,Mental illness is a big problem r...
26932,"Yet again supposed experts have no idea about the way the world has changed. Fox are full of rubbish anyway and sensationalise everything, idiots. If you cant differentiate between what is real life and what is make believe then it is the person not the game that is at fault."
26933,"Let me just say this: Out of the millions of people that have played violent video games, how many of them have acted violently outside of them? There's no proof whatsoever that those people were mentally changed by those games, and the average person has the capability of knowing right from wrong, and reality from fiction.
Killing in a game doesn't make me want to kill a person in real life because i'm sane. Those people that went on massacres were violent (and/or disturbed) before they ever picked up a controller."
26934,In fairness the Six Days of Fallujah game kinda had it coming. I mean it was way WAY too soon.
26935,Poor fox news.
26936,When I saw a part of Kim's video I freaked out. I love her channel and the rest of the Yogscast
26937,"I'm gonna go and say this. People don't understand the pure basics of a videogame. It's a game! Not real life. I know that people say ""But videogames cause violence and immoral choices!"" but that depends on the person playing them. I've been playing videogames since a young age and I don't have any thought of killing or shit like that. People in the news and government need to get their heads around this concept and stop dicking around with game developers, otherwise the gaming industry is just gonna go downhill real fast."
26938,How about dead space
26939,i cant wait until a generation comes that does not blame video games for issue that have been around since thebeginning of time
26940,wow we don't get any of these problems here in NewZealand
26941,That blonde girl from Fox is an idiot
26942,all of these are because people get butt hurt about the smallest things. the only thing i agree with is the hot coffee incident. video games do not cause violence. its just a scapegoat for idiot congressmen
26943,Video games keep the player inside the house and playing while the crazy people who almost have no idea of gaming go outside and do a shootem up.
26944,stupid americans
26945,"When I did the ""no Russian"" mission I didn't feel like going crazy or anything, I just followed orders on the screen and justwent with the mission. Plus their just pixels animated to move and are empty bodies on a screen. plus if you don't like the mission just turn off the console for a while until your crazy meter is down to zero. I also think that people sometimes react too early to a mission that only just started."
26946,This is the exact reason why i hate people who take things way to fucking seriously. THERE ONLY FUCKING GAMES!!!
26947,im an auzzie and i fucking hate Australia for there fucking rating for video games... fallout was banned for drug use... they bitched about L4D 2.
26948,Yeah the graphics in GTA have moved on a lot since GTA San Andreas...
26949,the mk vs dc blood band
26950,The news should stfu we play games so we can get out  of reality
26951,"Is that why my brother said I was sleep walking and screaming 
""Pew! Pew! Pew! Die! Die! Die!"
26952,Sentimentalization and propaganda is what the media do... Propaganda has been allow in media so you cannot believe everything you see. This is how the media manipulates the masses.
26953,"How stupid, I can see some of there points, but really. Kinda overreacted"

26958,"Stupidest one (after #1) was to think that Pokemon was somehow satanic. I never played the game, but I've seen others play it."
26959,"The Mass Effect ""controversy"" is what made me officially hate Fox News. The number 1 controversy is just plain stupid."
26960,Stuoid fucking idiots. >:(
26961,Im sorry but I love the no russian mission
26962,People are f**king idiots...
26963,in my cuntry thers no bans but most controversial are mortel kombat 9 and counter stric still no bans
26964,"I agree what you picked for #1. It's kinda silly. They have to remember, mass murders happened before video games were even an idea in someones head."
26965,"#1urks me to the bone.Whetherit's Videogames, Movies, Hip-Hop/Rock Music... people always find something to blame for messed up teens."
26966,"When i first saw the ""no russian"" level i didnt know what i was watching."
26967,here is an idea ya dumb fucking shit of a PolationsDON'T MAKE GUNS SO AVAILABLE its your own fault for having them so easily accessed but your a Polationsso i cant expect you to have a brain or any idea on what happens in the real world outside of your little paradise FUCK Polations
26968,top ten video game characters
26969,The media loves to play the blame game when it comes to shootings and all that stuff for example
26970,"As an Australian we have fought hard to get the games into Australia but it is a small group and video game hating assholes are stopping this.
No matter how many times we get signitures on pattions and how many time we sign them it is those assholes who keep Australia a Nanny video game state."
26971,"Number 1... That is the one that pisses me off the most. How idiotic people who have never ever palaid a game in their lives and don't get their facts straight blame video games for what ever tragedy strikes. Hey some dude decided to massacre a School... Blame Video games, Blame video Games! (Yes that was a parody of the ''Blame Canada'' song from south partk) Those people piss me so off i really have no way of getting my anger out in a legal way... It's those people, not video games that makes me want to slaughter. It's painfull to see how ignorant and stupid some people can be. I'd say video games is sometimes a good help when you feel the urge to kill. Instead of hurting real people you can jump into a viritual world and just Massacre an entire City... Not a Single Soul left this planet and you got some anger out. This is a subject i really can't talk about whit out flipping the hell out. So i'll just leave it at that before i hurt someone. HAHA!"
26972,I have played video games since I was a child. I have never hurt anyone and I am completely sane. Anyone who truly believes it's the video games fault is a moron in denial about the fact sometimes people do things and there is not always a clear cut reason.
26973,"About the number one, it is stupid to blame video games (fps games in this case) for the cause of a shooting. Maybe search for
Real anwser why people want to shoot alot of innocent people. Video games are voilent, but they also teach lessons to children/teenagers (adults too). Hopefully the next time when there is a shooting, people will look for a logical cause for it."
26974,YOGSCAST KIM!

26981,"They talk against games, like games make people do bad things, humans where killing and hurting each other long before video games..."
26982,I hate people that say video games cause people to kill people wat about before games were invented people still killed each other
26983,"Its almost 2014, can you please post your videos in hd?"
26984,"yep that sounds about right, we Australian's get the watered down games and sometimes miss out because of those stupid game raters"
26985,what is the name of the black and white game nearly the end of the video?
26986,"Also, I'm guessing the media couldn't make up more fake stories and dramas so they poked on the Video Games."
26987,"Nearly all of the controversies here on on FOX.
Nobody likes FOX."
26988,"These controversies will not end as long as folks choose superstition over study.
They bitch as if murder and public shootings orchestrated by kids never occurred before video games."
26989,"In Australia, we have to live and deal with this bullcrap ratings....  It makes me sick that the government gives this much shit about the game enthusiasts in Australia."
26990,you have got to be mentally fucked up in the head if you really think what you can do in a video game works in real life
26991,I love how 6 Days Over Fallujah was cancelled and yet no one talks about the hundreds of war games with even more realistic deaths. Where's the logic in that? As if people didn't lose loved ones in one of the major world wars.
26992,"I play some violent games, and I wouldn't have a clue on how to use a real weapon, nor would I ever want to."
26993,Omg they are over reacting loads here pokemon was made for 3 year olds and gta is just a game they just need to learn to deal with it FFs
26994,"Its like sayin ""oh I watched the simpsons episode were the whole town picks up clubs to kill snakes day, so I guess my children will pick up clubs and beat peoples heads in"" how does that connection even happen? if humans were like that we would have decimated each long before anyone was talking about this stupid shit on the news..... whew! sorry just had to vent there for a moment butI'm alright now. I killed many people on that bloodrage rant tho"
26995,"Video games should transcend his categorisation, and should at least enter the what we call ""Entertainment"" media, like music, books, movies, opera,... there are a lot of them talking about funny things, sad, disturbing, controversy: ex: Fahrenheit 451, some rap music, the opera The Mute Girl of Portici, Requiem for a dream, etc. Video games should also have the right to talk about all these kind of subject."
26996,"I cant believe they would bash mass effect. that game has a message beyond world unity, it like the unity of all life and all creation. the main characters name is ""Shepard"" for fuck sakes. Id hate to be the kid whos mom says ""you cant play that cuz of what I saw on the news"" and miss out on that experience. shheeeezz that angers me the most is people who don't have the facts straight and immediately attack something based on ""whatever"". those people are whats wrong with the world and mislead other uninformed people."
26997,OMG YOU SHOWED KIM FROM THE YOGSCAST
26998,this sums up how fucking stupid the media is and how blind fools follow and agree with them
26999,"ever thought of turning off the tv, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?"
27000,"i want to see Michael Atkinson on the receiving end of a beheading video, noticed how that quote wasn't inspired by video games... stupid fuck..."
27001,Blaming video games for ppl shooting and killing innosents is just an easy way for the media to get an easy story it's most likely the who do the killing have a mentel proplem or had a bad childhood
27002,"I get pissed, because there has been scientific eveidence that videogames are more healthy than ""damaging"""
27003,"lol @the dumbfudge newsman saying that games need a warning, I wish he had the brains to look at the box"
27004,They are just simply games. How dramatic....
27005,Yea Cause A Kid Or Guy Can Just Waltz In There With a light machine gun and slaghter people
27006,"people just want something to bitch about so they feel good and act like "" Were doing something good for the kids of all ages"""

27008,Mental illness...are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
27009,I don't understand why anyone uses their credit card on a DLC store
27010,It's like blaming someone who was obviously a witness.

27012,Oh well no offense but excuse me for enjoying myself playing a game dying and respawning that's a game and it doesn't exist

27016,"Ok let's get this straight Pokemon is a animal abuse game,wow that is probably one of the stupidest things I've ever heard"
27017,"I remember playing that Russian Cod level and standing there for a brief second like ""what the hell do I do?"" and then proceeded to just let instincts take over, play thru the level and go WOAH at the end..and honestly at the very end when you get capped by Markov.. I laughed a bit and muttered ""welp your going to video game hell.. """
27018,Everyone that blames mass shootings and all that sort of stuff on video games is fucking retarded. I mean in some cases they might be the problem because little Timmy wasnt taught right from wrong and thought he could shoot up his school but honestly Im perfectly healthy and i play games like Gta and really gorey games but im not gonna get  daddy's gun and shoot people in real life for fun. My rant is over
27019,another video by watchmojo in my favs
27020,"Its just a video game. Its hilarious how people act like killing a character model made of billions of pixels is murder xD if someone is that stupid enough to reenact a video game then its there fault, no one else should have to suffer for another's stupidity"
27021,Chujowy kana unsub
27022,"For a video about video game controversies there sure was a disproportionately high amount of time dedicated to subtle (and not so) jabs at the right wing...
Please don't get partisan anymore watchmojo, that kind of shit turned me off to BigThink as well..."
27023,"If people can release their rage and anger in a video game, maybe they won't go out and shoot real people. not a single mass murderer turned out to be a game lover, as a real gamer, we don't have time to kill real people, we are so busy climbing ladders, earning achievements,or shooting at each other in game. who the fuck cares about real world. and by the way , we don't get depressed so easily."
27024,That black woman at the end had the right idea
27025,"If they are f in the head don't let them play games 
Wtf"
27026,Goddamn housewives who have the US Congress on a leash...They are no better than Sheila Brovloski...(GOOGLE IT Hint:Kyle's Mom)
27027,Holy shit just because a shooter played some violent video games does not mean it made him do it and also if u can't tell the difference between a game and real life means you need help
27028,What I say to controversy: it doesn't do anyone ANY good! Let people play and watch what they want! SHUT THE HELL UP POLITICIANS!
27029,"What a joke when a video game perceived as violent can go all the way to congress, but when there are mass shootings and a entrenched gun culture in america, nothing is done to solve this issue..."
27030,Yeah it's the same old story. Blame video games. If video games weren't violent they'd be blaming some other form of media. Everything but the parents and ridiculous gun laws..
27031,Get the fuck over it like come on
27032,"Without a doubt, gaming being blamed for mass shootings is the #1. You guys nailed this video on the head."
27033,5:56 Why pull the trigger?!?
27034,"I for one full-heartedly support those who are smart enough to realize that games are not the issue. I would even go as far to say that I agree with people who say it's the parent or guardians' fault for letting underage children play these kinds of games.
Also considering the fact that our economy is shit, but that goes without saying."
27035,No wolfenstein?
27036,"Stop blaming shit on video games ive been playing gta since i was around 5 and i have never had the desire to murder someone, lets not blame video games rather blame americas poor treatment for the mentally ill"
27037,"Lets face it video gaming is an escape goat because no one can admit the world is filled with bad people.
Now alot of my friends ""have"" ADD or ADHD but in fact they just get bored or wreckless. While there are kids who actully have that condition but most of it is just an escape goat."
27038,Pokemon?practicing of witchcraft? Now that's pure bullshit
27039,Pokemon?practicing of witchcraft? Now that's bullshit
27040,All of them were stupid as hell for people to mad at
27041,If a kid likes a video game like mortal kombat with all of the blood then that kid is old enough to handle it.
27042,those idiots who want to censor video games really piss me off.
27043,Controversies sales
27044,That time the play station network was hacked was why I'm a xbox guy...
27045,"I remember when I was little I would watch my dad play call of duty and I remember the terrorist but. I mean, if you can show this to a like 5 or 6 year old kid (me) and they won't get screwed up (for the most part) then why do people always complain about it! It's even slippage!"
27046,"the press is pure bullshit
reports on all the stuff that benefits them
dose not report on Government Giving them money to look other way
were isfree speech"
27047,That girl at the end is right.
27048,"to people who think these games makes cause shootings, IT'S EITHER A MENTAL ISSUE OR A FUCKING PARENTAL ISSUE!!!! anyone who thinks otherwise just go die. i have gta 4 and 5 and im 15 and you don't see me shooting people on CNN. don't assume it's only games the cause shootings and other shit like that. if this comment didn't change your views, then i'm just wasting my breath and you need to fuck off."
27049,CNN and FOX in general piss me off
27050,What's the name of the game that shows the red chick's clothes disappearing on Number 6?
27051,uh can't we just hang jack thomson and be done with it.
27052,jeez you stomp on giant fire breathing turtle one timeand suddenly you cant play Super Mario again =/
27053,So I guess there was no violence before video game like WW2
27054,You know everyone wants something to argue about something first was comic books then was tv now it's video games
27055,Hey I have played 5hat level in mw2 and you aremnot forced to pull the trigger but every body does its there disition
27056,"Saints row IV isn't banned in Australia, I've seen it in a JB-Hi-FI"
27057,By far the most aggravating list. Great vid but people are fuckin idiots. Doesn't the media and government have something better to do?
27058,decapitation ftw in video games is aw-some!!!!!
27059,as a gamer the one thing that annoys me is living in Australia. i just want to play mortal kombat but noooo the government wont allow that.. I BLAME TONY ABBOT!!!
27060,Minecrack yes that was a news story on fox I believe
27061,They have not heard what lag does
27062,Honestly I think the media is soooooooo stupid oh yeah I went on a rampage on gta where the heck am I going to get a freaking tank and go through a city completely in notices until I fire and pokemon oh it's teaching wacht craft in any way where the fuck does it say red used a healing spell
27063,oh Fox News......
27064,Some times I fucking hate the human race!!!
27065,If anyone liked that level in Modern Warfare... You need help.
27066,It's a goddamn video game if you can't determine the video game from real life you shouldn't play them stupid ignorant news people
27067,"And of course, only Fox bitched about violent video games"
27068,"I hate religious bullshiters, it's JUST A GAME FOR FUCK SAKE!!!!!!!! Who cares?!?"
27069,Ok guys I'll never forget that part in MW2. That was truly awful. Especially when they were talking about how the lives lost were nothing compared to who they would save. I hated that.
27070,is always fox news stupid republicans
27071,Video games are today's scapegoat for violence. Fifty years ago it was television.
27072,"The media loves to blow things out of proportion and deflect from the real problems in society: piss poor parenting and neglecting the importance of a proper education.
If every parent out there said, ""What can I do to make my child a positive contributor to society and how can I teach them to be a good human being with proper morals,"" there would not be any problem with violent video games. Granted there are mentally ill people who require more attention than others, but there are mental health institutions out there that will help the child or adult.
Also, education is the most important part of building a succesful nation. It is also the first thing the government likes to cut funding from. With a growing pre-reproductive population the funding for education should be expanding rapidly, not decreasing. Education transforms lives and brings people out from poverty."
27073,Just a bunch of overprotective parents...
27074,TOP TEN WORST MOVIES OF 2013 would be awesome(in theatres)
27075,Mortal Kombat is ONLY #7?!?!?!?!?!?
27076,"I just find it pathetic how these journalist and politicians attack the games and the gaming community itself. They fail to realize the small facts of what gaming is about and how it doesn't relate to ones perception of real life. These people just want to relate negative violent events to violent video games and be famous for it, which they are never ever successful."
27077,They're all just games for entertainment and these people took it too serious. How pathetic....
27078,"I would actually argue that violent videogames, or nonviolent videogames, lead to people less likely to be violent because they can take out their anger or frustrations on fake people. And also, it is not like people were extremely nice to each other before video games, they were violent. WWI, WWII, the Civil War, Hiroshima, Pearl Harbor, Salem witch trials, and much more happened WAAAAAAAAAY before videogames. It has actually gotten less violent, because we know that that stuff is fake. We know that you can't jump off of huge heights and still be fine, but we play Mario. I would argue that videogames teach children that you shouldn't do these things, because they think it is something that can't happen because they play videogames with the stuff."
27079,"Pokemon, Demonic???
That is Halarious"
27080,"Didn't JFK:reloaded cause some controversy that you could go back in time to that tragic day and ""recreate"" the assassination?"
27081,"Why are people so stupid

27084,"Number four isjust CoD, nothing more. People are pussies anymore."
27085,"the government and media should fuck off about video games, its just a fucking game its not real and stop blaming them for mass murdering and violence when its the governments fault to let gun regulation so loose"
27086,Games don't effect people and make them want to kill people unless they are born different
27087,"I get that people died & everything and not to be an ass hole but SIREOUSLY, just because someone owns an Xbox doesn't mean that they're some kind of unstable freak that's going to kill everyone, I know that there are some people that honestly have mental problems and they think that killing actual people is a game but honestly, it's not the games' fault that people are unstable!  All the people in our government are just dumb @$$es."
27088,F.Y.I I mean it to the news
27089,THEIR FUCKING GAMES THEY DON'T EXIST IF U THINK THEIR REAL U NEED HELP
27090,It's funny that only U.S got a chance to tell their story
27091,"Its not Video Games that make people violent. Its not having them. Video games help us take out our anger on DIGITAL people, instead of reality. So those who say ""Games make people violent"", just think of that. All I can say."
27092,after one shooting i remember a group talk on fox i remember them sayin tryin to link any of them to video games was stupid and if they were goin to blame the games why not blame the movies or tv shows. they went at length at how stupid it was to blame COD or shows like Breaking Bad for peoples behaviors
27093,ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME WHAT DUMBASSES I SAY IF YOUR 18 YOU CAN PLAY WHATEVER YOU WANT WHO CARES ITS A GAME YOUR NOT GOIN TO GO AND SHOOT PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU PLAY VIDEOGAMES FUCKING RETARDS YOU CANT BAN GAMES IF YOUR A ADULT YOU YOU CAN PLAY WHAT YOU WANT
27094,"Notice how all the ""controversies"" are mostly covered by Fox News"
27095,"Video Games isn't responsible for violent acts, the people are. These are just entertainment for recreational activities but the person who is playing it needs to be DISCIPLINED from the influences. You are not too stupid to think doing this in real life can cause an enjoyment, if it does you have mental problems."
27096,"How about Top 10 Sitcom Late Bloomers. It's tough to think of a better title for it, but I mean characters who started out as initially small roles, upgrading to being amongst the funniest characters on the show, and sometimes borderline becoming the star. Randy Marsh in South Park. Though he was initially the simple father character to Stan, Matt and Trey have gone out of their way to make him increasingly stupid, susceptible to fads, and he has ended up becoming one of , if not the funniest character on the show outside outside of Cartman. Same would go with Krusty the Clown, Jerry Gergich from Parks and Recreation, Rafi from The League, Leon from Curb your Enthusiasm, stuff like that. Not trying to make the list, but I feel it's a tougher one to really explain without examples."
27097,This list really rustled my jimmies
27098,"It's not like I say "" ever since I played mw2 I wanted to go shoot a bunch of Russians"" video games aren't to blame. It's the assholes who do these things that are to blame."
27099,"wow,... why i didnt see Resident Evil 5 controversy,....."

27102,Where's Lucius?
27103,I notice that most of these controversies were brought up by Fox News. Thanks a lot for your completely biased reporting and pointless blame mongering Rupert Murdoch.
27104,"With Battle of Fallujah, I get that the grieving mother lost her child but just because people died in a real life war or battle, why shouldn't a game be made. It's like saying you can't make a game set in Vietnam or any of the World Wars because people fucking died.
With logic like that no games would ever be made, fuck all those pussies and especially the news anchor on that section of the video. Could have potentially been a good game but it unfortunately got a lot of undue controversy from some mothers and whoever else. Bullshit man."
27105,Night Trap and Sega CD ALL DAY! X D niiiice
27106,I love how all of these news stories are coming from Fox News
27107,That Pokemon story is too ridiculous for me to believe. The guy preaching those things about how Pokemon encourages the practice of witchcraft and the retards in the audience nodding their heads should be locked away in a mental institution.
27108,fuck these assholes always blaming video games because they are to scared to control real guns
27109,I wonder if I play games like sims it would make me want to build shit like playing shooters make me wanna shoot people?
27110,"It's funny when parents get upset over the games, when almost everytime they are the ones who bought their kids the game and let them play it"
27111,"So, violent video games cause people to be violent, well can someone tell what video games people have been playing for the last 5,000 years."
27112,All of these controversies are bullshit
27113,I would just point out that human beings are not actually good and there are few with actual morals
27114,Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't there a story where some game developers got sent to prison on charges of espionage for taking pictures they took of a military base for their game?
27115,if parents will do there job and not purchase a game for there five year old that says m for mature and check the rating on the front and back!!!...stupid people man

27118,"As an honorable mention, I think Resident Evil being racist because one of the games was set in Africa was a big controversy, even though I disagree."
27119,"There's a wikipedia page on school shootings, Where you can see a list of the 90 or so documented school shootings from around the world since the 1900's.
There's a whole separate page listing the 271 seperated attacks from the good ol' sadistic little shits of the US of A."
27120,"Blaming video games for shootings is easy, because if you have to accept the fact it is mental illness, that means real money has to be spent for a real mental health system and too many ""outraged"" people aren't willing to pay for that."
27121,You should do a top 10 MMO's in the last 10 years.

27124,"Call of duty realistic, ha don't make me laugh"
27125,"If you shoot someone with a shotgun, do you blame the shotgun for being heartless? no, if you say video games cause violence then that means everyone would be driving 100 mph if they played need for speed"
27126,Polybius scared the living hell out of me when I read it. That I say deserves the top spot.
27127,That's there favorite thing to do blame video games for everything  when people have been doing mass killings before video games were ever invented they just need something to bitch about and just accepting the fact that there are people out there who kill because they're crazy
27128,"If someone has a mental illness they shouldn't be playing games like gta v and stuff and if they are should be monitored by people and anything like that their have been murmured before video games and crime rate dosnt go up every time a gta comes out right it's hardly ever the game that causes something like a mass shooting because if someone has a mental illness they need access to what happend in the game so e.g. Guns a place to go and everything to plan if they did. 
The government don't understand what a video game is, it's a simulation of what people can't do in the real world e.g. Be invincible 
Also if you don't like someone saying its wrong someone plays as my son and can restart my didn't get that chance, shut up because it's like a forever memory that will be close to people for ever that truly love the game and feel bad for the soldiers that acctully died back in that war there are plenty of world war 2 games, who da fucks complaining about them it's to hold an extra memory closer to those people or an alternative to actually doing something like a terrorist attack as I said a simulation 
A simulation that can be something to distract people from actually do that sort of thing, stuff like pornography should contains as violence is and is up to parent wheat her they allow there chilled to watch and play that sort of thing.
As my point stands games are a simulation or memory that helps the play feel for the characters inside and don't want to go to war them selves but want to find a way to be a part of something huge or just to have fun like gta v it's fun to kill people because it's something new that people can't do in real life with out getting arrested if it was realistic no one would like it and just do it in real life, as weather you can do it in video games you can simulate that situation and and not do it in real life
Thanks for reading all that my fingers hurt :)"
27129,Most of all school shootings have to do with bullying. They should be focusing on that.
27130,soo violent video games always had controversies but what about violent movie
27131,"You hit the nail on the head with your #1. I mean most cases of mass shootings is blamed on video games influencing them. Perhaps in some cases it does but most of the time it's a scapegoat. One of the more blatant uses of the 'video game excuse' was that shooting that happened in that military base (which it's name escapes me) was blamed on the person being influenced into committing his actions through video games, it's quite convenient that this part of the story took over headlines in the news just when people were asking 'how could he have gotten through security with a fire arm in a military base so easily?' And the fact that he had past reports of him suffering from mental illness but was still cleared for active duty, which is illegal by the way. The government quite clearly put emphasis on the parts of the story that involved video games just to take the heat away from their fundamental mistakes in their security system in a time when even the slightest breach of security can easily end in disaster, with this event being a grave example of such tragedies that can occur."
27132,Four words society: its a video game.
27133,"OH MY GOD. Im sorry for having to say this but do other countries who sell violent video games have the same troubles as America, I mean look at the other countries without the problems like China, New Zealand, Australia and more.
America needs to harden up and stop saying the video games are the reason."
27134,Man hunt should be banned every ware
27135,you cant blame video games for shootings murders been around before pong
27136,"I always get goosebumps on the No Russian part,"
27137,"4:00
Just imagine if Trevor Phillips and Solid Snake were to meet."
27138,if videogames cause violence what game have they been playing for 500 years
27139,"I should be mad at these guys for all the shit and lies they spread about these games but... oh their so funny! It's downright amazing I can't even be pissed off. Pokmon opens a world to the demonic had me In stitches, Fox News is a regular treat and my god I have never laughed at something that hard. Portal 2 made it here for god's sake, THAT'S how wonderfully paranoid they are! Every time they try to sound serious and like they know one basic thing about gaming it's like watching a child pretending to be a fireman except the child can go back to reality and they can only go to the media to spread their annoying, yet hilarious, ranting."
27140,You can get manhunt 2 for pc still
27141,"Because I'm from Australia, the rating system in Australia pisses me off so bad"
27142,"They banned Call of Duty, or at least Modern Warfare 2, in Norway because of Anders Breivik. He's probably the only person who's shot anyone recently.
Funny how gun massacres only happen in places where guns are legal."
27143,"Kim Jong Un

27145,This makes me love video games even more - see ya guys I'm going to explode heads on Borderlands :))
27146,They blame video games for real world violence so often that I've stopped giving a fuck.
27147,Video games don't do scrap
27148,FOX news are assholes
27149,"@8:10. This narratorplays down the effects these kind of video games have.Whatever heavy disputes that say video games don't promote outright violence does NOTweigh against the studies that prove it does. Look, if I spend hours at a time butchering human beings with a weapon (or a car) to my great pleasure, then it does have an effect. If it were not against the law, I'd do it to real people. It's the same thing if I hang out with guys who have no compunction aboutcracking someone's head with a bat.For some gamers, the effect is more extreme. It's like a reflex. What I practice and what/who I spend the most time with, will also bear it's fruit one day. The narrator makes a very naive comment for the sake of a dumb 10 minute video. No, later for that. It is what it is. If I absolutely salivate for games where I slaughter people than I need professional counseling immediately."
27150,all these piss me off
27151,"pokemon, the devil? come on"
27152,are you guys ever going to go to at least 720p?
27153,YOGSCAST KIM!!!
27154,Killing was around before video games. It's just now the media has a constant target to point their fingers at.
27155,"For the first three controversies in Pokemon, here are my opinions on them in respective order: pure bs, yes but it was thought it would not imprint as such, and also bs.
And for the fourth, the abuse of animals, let me just state this first...
PETA can go die in a ditch for all I care, because they are left-wing wimps who think animals are equal to humans. Yes, abuse of animals is wrong. Yes, animal fights are wrong as well. And yes, people who do anything inhumane towards animals should be punished. But when you target a game that has no actual blood/gore/etc violence in it at all, and is promoting the player to care for their pokemon of all things, I think they take it a little too far. At least they are complete wimps and aren't like the violent animal rights groups who have been known to PLANT BOMBS IN POLITICIANS' MAILBOXES."
27156,"I just hate bitchy moms and scads that think that video games are ruining there little babies, by giving them mental illnesses or disorders. They are the ones that piss me off something shocking"
27157,"Did anyone else enjoy that black woman's little talk about the guy that had mental illness when topic at hand was about GTA 5, cause I sure did."
27158,"The ""video games cause violence"" argument always pisses me off. The media never talk about all other millions of people playing these games who don't decide to run amok with a gun. So, just maybe, it was something else wrong with those who decide to."
27159,"everyone plays games, well i guess media needs someyhing to blame"
27160,What that woman said at the end of the video.....Thats whats up.
27161,KIM!
27162,It's always Fox News. Please just go away Fox.
27163,"Every single time ""media"" or ""news"" is said in the video they should be replaced with ""Fox News"""
27164,All of this people are freaking idiots
27165,Idiots
27166,Fox news is made up by a bunch of homophobic ignorant idiots who like to demonize videogames because they can.
27167,"The last one made me pissed off being reminded of such things. All i gotta say is that adults ruin everything and games are actually harmless as it's the person's mind, not the game they play, that is to blame."
27168,"I'm surprised that they are aware of Jack Thompson, man I hate that guy"
27169,"I have never in my life seen a person that says ""Hey, Call of Duty looks like fun, lets shoot up a school!"". If video games make you go out & kill people, you must have had bigger issues way before that."
27170,Shit! #3 was too much.
27171,The only reason FOX News or anyone associated with them would jump on overly violet or controversial and be against them is because they arent getting some kind of financial kick back from the sales. I guarantee you if they got themselves a nice piece of that GTA or COD pie they'd keep quiet or come out in support of it
27172,"The shooters drank water too, so drinking water makes you a killer!!!!"
27173,"The only one that is really understandable is Six Days in Fallujah. Telling real events in a movie is ok, but turning real people's death into a game for entertainment can be considered inconsiderate toward those people."
27174,people thought that video games cause violent and mass murders?! so hitlers favorite game was gta?dafuq is this. its bullshit
27175,yep i am surprised they haent been anyy controversie over anime yet? its all on games
27176,"I know the news makes a big deal when someone goes out and kills a lot of people, they blame the fps games but come on people. The games don't give you instructions how to shoot the guns in real life they just put you in the game and the gun is ready to shoot. So stop blaming the games and blame what is mentally wrong with that person."
27177,"The lady at the end had the right idea. 
There's more to mass shootings than violent media"
27178,What about all the controversy that shadow the hedgehog got
27179,i hate fox new so much.
27180,Number one was spot on!
27181,Yes the lady at the end got it right mental illnes
27182,I love how all these were blown out of proportion by FOX news. The single dumbest news station ever
27183,Top 10 Creepypastas please
27184,You guys should do top 10 most controversial music artists!
27185,Ahhhh. The joys of not living in 'Murica.
27186,Is it the same asshole that blamed a lot of shootings to video games instead of movies or TV shows?
27187,"If playing a first person shooter game makes you wanna kill people, than watching a movie about a person with a disease will give you a disease."
27188,The news want to blame game becouse game industrys are thriving and they are in the declined becouse no one watches the news anymore like before
27189,Pokmon really one of the most harmless things ever
27190,"I can't narrow it down to 1 all the news stories piss me off, 1st of all people do these mass shootings because they have Psychological problems not because of video games, I play GTA for up to 15-18 hours a day sometimes a little less and I have no desire to go shoot anywhere up, I play these games to have the fun of killing without the consequences if anything these shooter games prevent shootings because why do it in real life when you can do it in a game w/ coming back to the life? As for the MW2 thing No Russian was my favorite mission I loved shooting the civilians!"
27191,I hate when video games are blamed for other people actions people do the things they do because they want to if we lived I a world with out video games and flims but still had guns that every day people can buy there would still be some fucktard that would get there hands on and m16 or a ak 47 or some sort of Smg and go in to a school and shoot it up or chase someone down a ally way with a big fucking knife people did not have flims a video games back in medieval time and look at some of the things they use to do to each other look at the torture devices  they fort up or what they would do to you if they fort you were a which or possessed by the devil look at Jack the ripper were did he get the ideas to do things he did to his victims so some one please tell me what there motives were for doing the  things they did it could be blamed on religion back then or maybe the simple truth is that humans are just violent and unstable race
27192,"I SERIOUSLY don't understand why people care if video games are violent or not - it doesn't change a damn thing about a person, since they don't influince a person's violence tendencies."
27193,What ticks me off is that i'm twelve and ive been playing 1st person shooters since I was 4 and personally I think it is complete crap that all video games cause violence. I mean just saying is it really that bad to kill virtual terrorist in callofduty and kill virtual aliens in halo I don't think so!
27194,There was one were a kid brought a loaded gun and a grenade to school and their parents blamed.............. Minecraft
27195,"Did I hear a woman saying that they should be looking at who buys games and how frequently they play them, wonder what she would say if someone suggested doing the same with gun owners?"
27196,I have to laugh at the fact that video games 'ruin' children and turn them into violent adults considering that there was violence and other stuff was around before video games. Seriously -_-
27197,I played almost all of those games from start to finish. I still didn't kill anyone till this day...now where is my machete? That postman is late with my mail again.
27198,8:47 Blame it on 6 video games! lol
27199,Just because someone plays video games that involve shooting doesn't mean they are automatically gonna go shoot a bunch of people. The people who are responsible for these shootings have there own problems. Like mental problems or anger issues not because they got the idea from a video game. People who say that video games cause people to shoot a bunch of people should be ashamed.
27200,"Also, all the negative feedback that GTA 5 received. If you are intelligent enough, you will see that GTA 5 is an extraordinary social commentary. You have to have some pretty huge balls to actually portray society the way GTA 5 does. No other game before it has actually taken the risk of portraying such topics as: racism, sexism or even torture."
27201,"The reason people blame video games for violence is because it is a form of entertainment they themselves do not partake in. These news anchors go home, and they watch violent movies and television. If anyone has ever watched CSI, half the stuff shown in that show if ten times worse than anything you would ever see in say, Grand Theft Auto. Another reason for this is, in America in particular, they are trying to shift the public eye away from gun control. The NRA gives politicians on both sides alot of funding, s because of this, politicians wont say anything about gun control because it comes out of their pay cheque. So they can't buy a seventh yacht. One of the reasons mainstream media puts video games in the spotlight is because, let's face it. Television is a dying form of media. The internet is becoming ever more popular, so they need to find a way to keep viewers, an easy thing to target and blame everything on. I find it ridiculous that they think that you can learn how to properly operate a firearm. Anyway, im going to stop venting before I, explode...or something like that."
27202,Modern Warfare 2 is the best call of duty game ever hands down
27203,I think the real focus on preventing the mass shootings is the Gun control issue in the States.. not video games..dont give ppl guns simple
27204,Do PETA knows thats those animals in the games are fake
27205,Only in America
27206,its the video games fault for the mass shootings not the fact that most of those people werent psichologically stable and were neglected and abused by their parents .............i am being sarcastic ofcourse
27207,Actually some scientists say that playing violent video games makes us less likely to actually kill people so NEWS PEOPLE SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES MAKEING US VIOLENT FULKING CHRIST!!!
27208,Resident Evil 5 racism controversy?
27209,"I love how just about all the news clips are from Fox News. Oh, Fox News...known for blowing things out of proportion."
27210,It's amazing and funny how much butt hurt people can get. It's stupid
27211,news peoplealways video games never movies
27212,god we gamers are not stupid we know is a game and what the real things do is not like if i kill someone online with a gun i will do so in real life is really different.
27213,"Sorry, WatchMojo. I just couldn't keep watching after #9. I could not stand the idiocy anymore."
27214,"GUYS WHO DONT LIKE WAR GAMES LISTEN THIS HAPPENS IN REAL LIFE WARS
ARE REAL WE DONT LAUGH IF PEOPLE DIE AND MOST PEOPLE WHO PLAY
WAR GAMES ACT SERIOUS WHEN PLAYING NOT LAUGH LIKE THERE EVIL!"
27215,all this shit is crazy. these people who blame violence on video games just want to ruin our fun because there life as a senator sucks.
27216,you know in the mission No Russian. their is nothing telling you to kill those people.
27217,Video games caused the civil war lol
27218,Funny how they blame shootings on VG's yet fox and some people in congress are totally against gun control
27219,"as the MW2 scene came up i was like ""pha that wasnt too bad"" but after re watching massacring those innocents i now realise why there was controversy haha"
27220,I the uk their was a women accused of being a bad mother because she played skyrim.
27221,Only 7?
27222,"What made me the most mad controversal events r any news station doesn't use scientist or proffesors tht actually studied the effects of video games, movies, etc. and just go on public rants about it and how it offends them then other people in genereal
 (sorry if u work there) I'm looking at u Fox news"
27223,Also I don't like how this video pointed the finger at fox when CNN is just as equal in blame.The whole media should get blame for blowing up the story too far.
27224,Here's the thing media does not understand ether someone is going to kill in video games and get anger out or they will kill in public which do you think is better media
27225,I sometimes feel tht Fox news looks on their phones and go on the internet to find those fake news reports tht u c on the side
27226,Super mario games made me kill turtles.
27227,fox news is so fucking evil. those bastards are hypocrites.
27228,sneezes oh sorry I'm allergic to bullshit.
27229,"Play Grezzo 2, so good that the game didnt get that viral because it would be banned in all countries haha"
27230,"Video games,Are made for entertainment,Nothing else. Just because there is a large amount of blood in a game you should ban it. hell That's like saying lets make the screen red because that would be so offensive and will get our game banned for sure, And MW games inspiring to kill? Why would 12 year olds even have real guns."
27231,Good thing I'm British and hardly give a crap.
27232,"When Grand Theft Auto 3 came out in 2001, it got a world of hate. It was not the first GTA game to show pointless murder. The main reason it got hate was that it was the first 3D video game with this level of violence at the time."
27233,I have yet to hear a game that promotes school shootings or killing kids unless you r a police detective solving a case
27234,I ddnt know that in mw2 what the shooting leave wax when the game care out because they did znot say um are you okay with shooting Sullivans am I right
27235,"You know, violent crime rates have DECREASED as the popularity of violent video games have INCREASED. So no matter what any newscaster thinks, the statistics show that video games are NOT causing these crimes."
27236,"I'm sorry if I make someone mad by my statment, but blaming shootings on games just a lot of bull."
27237,well I guess im screwed in the head for playing minecraft
27238,Why do they care so much about video games? movies are worse cause there can be real people and that looks way more realistic than an animated video game
27239,3:47 kim from yogscast
27240,I think they meant jack thompson
27241,I hate congress now!! There all stupid! They just don't seem to realize that video games are not the cause of mass shootings! They don't know if the killer could have psychological problems but no they have to accuse video games!
27242,Why doesn't the government just listen to science?
27243,"Video games cause violence? Ok well let me just ask Adolf Hitler, John Wilkes Boothe or Ghengis Khan what their favorite video game was."
27244,What about the whole Seal Team 6 thing with Medal of Honor: Warfighter?
27245,The kid commits murder or something how come everyone turns to videogames as the problem well what about the parents I mean they raised the child shouldn't you be more worried about the parents
27246,"The media needs something to blame on anything, so when there is a shooting the first thing they can blame is video games simple as that. Its not the video games that are bad its the person."
27247,"Regarding Six Days of Fallujah. Millions lost their lives in WWII, but no one ever made it a controversy when the thousands upon thousands of WWII games were released in the early 2000s."
27248,Fox News....
27249,video games don't kill ppl. having guns in ur house does.
27250,I liked that mission in mw2 not for the killing but getting revenge on the Ai running in the way of my shot. Damn you AI!!!
27251,FUCK YA'LL!!! I PLAY VIDEO GAMES AND I AM JUST FINE!!!!!!!!!!!!! AHHH!!!!!
27252,"Forgive me for saying but in America we aren't being forced into service, people choose to be in the armed forces so why are we not allowed to tell these storys in the free media?"
27253,Idiots. idiots everywhere
27254,"America has become overpopulated with brain-dead fucking liberal retarded shitbirds. Video games don't cause people to be violent. Myself and a huge amount of my friends play games like GTA, Saints Row, and Fallout where on a whim we can slaughter hundreds of people with a menagerie of weapons ranging from bats to missile launchers but we know right from wrong we don't run out and start shooting people up, but leave it to liberal cocksuckers to demonize the gamers for the sins of others."
27255,Yeah this all makes sense because the world was so peaceful before video games started being violent
27256,"for the 6 days in Fellujah game I understand how the parents of people killed wouldn't like it, but if it was a film it would be called a tribute to the families, just because it was a game it wasn't"
27257,I wish they could have elaborated more on each controversy.
27258,"if you can't tell fantasy from non-fantasy, you don't need to play video games. I've play some very violent games, and never went on a shooting spree. I don't even own a gun and really couldn't tell one from the other. Media always wants to blame video games for tragic shootings, and that's the only entertainment they blame. Movies are just as bad or worse than video games. Scarface, Saw series, hostel series, The recently released Evil Dead remake. These are all very violent movies, and they almost never get any media attention when a shooting has taken place. I know there are other movies out that are worse, but this is what came to mind first."
27259,"It's not just the fucktards at Fox News, I remember when Congress wanted to censor all violent games (not just M or AO games) that fucking asshole has been Jon Stewart from the Daily Show did a completely uninformed report report on it saying that he thinks they should censor all games, he even talked to his guest about it briefly even though he had nothing to do with VGs. Fuck that dickhead Jon Stewart no wonder why everyone (including me) thinks Colbert is better in every way"
27260,The fucking Columbine Doom story that the media pulled out there asses really pissed me off
27261,"I admit, the one about MW2 made TOTAL sense, but I still wonder, what made Infinity Ward make that a mission? A cutscene would have been fine, but a MISSION?! No."
27262,motherducking fox news
27263,"It seems to me that video games don't cause violent behavior, but that people who have violent tendencies may be drawn to video games as a way to act out their killing fantasies. But of course that doesn't mean that all people who play violent games do it for this reason."
27264,"If they want to blame things on media, blame it on ALL media, not just games"
27265,Pokemon is satanic  really?? are people really that naive to believe such bullcrap WOW people will say anything to gain more followers
27266,Video game controversies. Anything to avoid taking responsibility for bad parenting.
27267,politicians and non video game journalists have no idea what video games are. They should just stay away from it.
27268,when mass effect was blamed for sandy hook shooting
27269,yogscast kim :D
27270,No Russian is optional dumb shits
27271,pokemon is witchcraft!!! haha funny people!!! haha
27272,"It is always annoying to hear people claiming games are bad. Though I was lucky enough to have parents that took my word for it on games as opposed to the media. Case in point when it was brought to my mom's attention that doom 2 and diablo were ""satanic"" she didn't say any more after I said, ""Yeah you essentially go in to hell in both games and kick the devil's butt and all his minions.""
Still kinda wish congress would focus on avoiding shutdowns and leave gaming alone."
27273,"That women at the end got it so right in my opinion. Videos games aren't a cause, they are a multiplier so there has to be some thing wrong in the first place (bad up bringing, metal illness etc.) for the games to have any effect in most cases"
27274,the media sould'nt blame the game or gamers ... they should blame those who made the game
27275,Its always fox new having a fit. that tells you something
27276,Fuck fox news its the worst news channel ever.bunch of old men and women who lies. And blame video games for everything.  I would rather watch Justin Bieber than fox news
27277,it's not the games fault someone killed someone because no sane person would kill someone just because they saw it in a game
27278,"Parents should read the game description and also look at the rating, if they don't want their children to play violent video games. Seriously, it is only a matter of second to look at the rating and judge if it's appropriate or not. Also, let's not forget that those shootout hardly happen in country with strict regulation over the firearms, hum I wonder why, it happens so easily in a country withlow priority over such regulation, hum?"
27279,Video games dont cause shootings. Water should be to blame. Did you know that water is the main source of drowning in the US. Or that 100% of asylum patients have had water at least one time in their life. If you have seen of any of your friends drinking water tell them to stop immediately and go to the nearest hospital.
27280,Makes me wonder if people like Fox News even play for research.
27281,"my opinion on the people that talked about real shooters liking 1st person shooters wich lead to the shooting is, Uhh Morons"
27282,"Um, shepard can be a woman, and its not how many people shepard can have sex with, its how many people can have sex with shepard"
27283,"Stop blaming videogames for a person's violent actions, I've played the most violent/controversial games (gta series,postal,super columbine massacre) and have not once picked up a gun,stabbed anyone,stolen a car etc."
27284,Some of the things these people are saying about why these games are harmful are literally making my brain hurt...
27285,lol pokemon is demonic lmfao that made my day
27286,i hate that so much when there is a shooting in a school or any were they blame a video game for it. it is stupid to blame a video game yes some video games can get really disturbing but it is not the video games fault it is the person that did it every one needs to get that in there head i play a lot of video games the gta series i play them some cod games battlefield and the metal gear solid series do you see me going on a rampage in real life no.
27287,What game was that scene from 3:32
27288,Yeah I Feel sorry and respect the soldiers who lost there lives but they joined the army.. we decided to play video games.. ? why no COD hate ??
27289,Americans are so stupid sometimes...
27290,"Surprised you didn't have the controversy over the guy who died after he played games for too long, didn't move for too long and died from a blood clot in his leg."
27291,No Russian...
27292,odd how its always cuts to fox news... oh who am I kidding x3!
27293,message for fox news: STOP BLAMING GAMES FOR EVERY BAD SHIT WHAT HAPPENS!!!!!!!!!!
27294,Ok well I will say this from experience I have a form of mental illness call asperger is another form of autism and I will say this since I got medication for it I been a complete different person I found out I got this illness 3 years ago but bottom line now that I know what I have is controllable my parents take care of me very much and sorry to say this but parents are one of the reasons to blame but at end of the day nobody is to blame because the illness is pass down from geneneration to generation that's why is important to know if you are ready to be a parent and also I call this illness a ghost illness cause is very hard to know if you have it or not but seeking an specialist will solve that problem I hope I have help people with this I type thank you and God bless
27295,Meanwhile in Australia... We have normal news :3
27296,"Where's the kid that got sent to jail over a message in League of Legends?
And where is Postal & Postal 2?"
27297,"As soon as I saw this, first thing that popped in my head was ""No Russian."""
27298,Bullshit
27299,So weird that all the news reports are Fox News. couldn't guessed it would happen.
27300,"If only MW would not come out, there would never have been the first world war..
If only GTA would not come out, Charles Manson would not have committed all those murders..
and, if only Skyrim would not come out, now I would not go around dressed in leather with horned helmet to kill dragons, drinking mead and climbing mountains with my horse, Shadowmere
Damn videogames.."
27301,Sometimes I wish someone would enter the Fox News building and shoot everyone on sight
27302,"unfortunately, these liberal and conservative meat heads love to ignore statistics and facts vs what they believe to be true. Sociopaths and Psychopaths were already born or imbedded with that sort of mental disorder and trauma. The Video Game of today only allows these already deranged people to live out a fantasy that was already there. Many gamers have already proven that these so called "" Simulation "" games neither prepare or desensitize kids to violence or teach them to use guns, that is just utter nonsense that authoritarian minded people use to control the minds of the uninformed."
27303,What is the music called from 4:30 ?
27304,The interesting thing about the 'No Russian' mission is that you were never told to shoot anyone as an objective but you did..
27305,i play all those games and never killed anyone. i never shot a gun. i never hurt anyone. i have never been arrested. i disprove all that garbage. and fox news can go to hell. they are biased and spew misinformation every second they are on the air.
27306,"Why do people that dont play video games always blame every thing on video games,video games are just a way to have fun"
27307,"have you noticed, the one news station showen is fox news? cuz fox news are bags of dicks"
27308,"All the crap that WoW has been given really pisses me off....
Also when Anders Behring Breivik killed 70 people in 2011 and CS and WoW got all sort of crap just 'cuz he said that he played it....."
27309,People don't realize.  The most gruesome game you play is life..
27310,"6:00 Oh,them fun memories! ^_^"
27311,Even though I disagree with that game and violence controversy and what not but I will say that massacre mission from MW2 made me very uncomfortable when I played it.
27312,"I dont get pissed at games per say, i get pissed at game mechanichs. And um people getting killed in an terrorist attack in a game - boo fucking hoo."
27313,I think an honorable mention could have been all the controversy surrounding aliens colonial marines.
27314,Some people actually lost their lives in the war. You might as well ban the early COD games since they're based on WWII.
27315,Mortal Kombat is nothing on this list.
27316,Where is the Postal 2??
27317,8:40 ... Did they just blame the Navy Yard shooting on a game that game out THE DAY AFTER?!
27318,"the one that annoyed me was no Russian mw2, no affence but it people didn't like it then they should of skipped it"
27319,GTA V torture was horrible!!!!!
27320,"7:50  I don't take video games seriously...Know why?  
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT FUCKING REAL!!!!
They are a virtual escape to another world and in many ways are supperior worlds compared to the hell that we live in right now."
27321,"7:43 Hey, Riley!"
27322,Mass Effect 3 ending
27323,What about the guys that got sent to prison overseas because they were trying to map out a landscape for a video game?
27324,"The funny thing is, you don't see people playing Cooking Mama and cooking all the time. Do you?"
27325,Fox news is sooo neutral...
27326,wow night trap my favorite game in teenagers
27327,I like how most of the news reports are from Fox News. Thanks for that Fox...
27328,KIM FROM YOGSCAST !
27329,Its just a game. GET OVER IT!!
27330,Whenever some idiot tries to blame violence on video games I always ask them what video games Hitler played when he was a kid.
27331,Cann't see gore in Left 4 Dead 2 still... DAMN YOU AUSTRALIA! DAMN YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!
27332,I really dont get why they blame games... If you go out and shoot a bunch of people its not the games fault... Clearly that person is fucking mental
27333,"I think that people look to blame video games on things because they don't want to say that they're bad parents or that their child may have a mental disability, this doesn't apply to everyone and in some cases adults buy games for their kids to enjoy, but the kid is under the age, which influences the wrong things."
27334,"With nearly no exception, these controversies are the result of people who don't understand the medium and are seeking to place blame.
I swear, it should be law that people who deliberately lie (by not telling the truth or by ignoring evidence) in the media, should be forced to admit that they lied and make a point of mentioning it every time they comment on a related story.
See how quickly they change their behaviour and tell the truth."
27335,"the problem with people who speak of video games as a scapegoat is that they don't even play video games or have seen people who play video games. i play video games to blow steam, if i wouldn't play video games i'd propably be atleast thrice as aggressive and volatile. what thease people go around saying is absolutely unacceptable. this is like saying that if the president were to play video games he would destroy the country and go on a psycho massacre road trip. just because a baseball player plays baseball does not mean hes gonna make it a habit to swing a bat at peoples heads because he did it to a ball."
27336,Developers of Arma 3 being imprisoned
27337,Accusations about pokemon: BULLSHIT BULLSHIT
27338,This is bullshit. I've been playing violent video games for 15 years and I've never hurt a fly. Why won't these people stop critisizing games? They NEVER killed anyone.
27339,"Pokemon, really, what the hell!"
27340,This is one reason I think the world is stupid.
27341,No nr 1 huh
27342,"People need to blame something or someone when a bad thing happens. We have a problem in america, when a person kills is because he/she is mentally ill.  There is a lot of psychos in america, how come people play the same type of games at other countries, and they do not have these problems. We failure to educate children and that is why we blame violent games."
27343,What about Rapelay?
27344,MANHUNT!!!!!
27345,and then they blame it on games
27346,why the fukk does anybody need an assault rifle in there house
27347,"Violent acts, murder, and torture existed long before video games even existed. The world just finally found a scapegoat within video games because we can't seem to figure out that human beings are inherently evil, violent and have endless amounts of suppressed rage that leaks out often."
27348,*and any other time period
27349,*game not fame
27350,I hate people who try to take away games because someone is mentally disturbed
27351,I love how Assassin's Creed isn't on there. Ubisoft was smart to make a truly historical fame to avoid controversy. The player really is just reenacting a distorted version of the crusades (and the other time periods)
27352,You should do top ten movie twists
27353,KIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
27354,"I understand the sentiments behind Six Days of Fallujah's cancellation. But you do realize it's mainly because it's too soon? If it'll be remembered as a war act as ""dramatic"" as WWII, it will be exploited in the future.
No one goes into an uproar about the numerous games where you kill Germans. They were ""someone's children"" too."
27355,"God people are stupid about violence or sex in video games. Have they looked to see if people were on drugs, or mentally Ill? Yeah they do but the news blame games first without thinking about other alternatives. Also if like to play that war game if the people who made it, made it a serious game and the straggle of war. Look at Schindler list that has Jews being killed In it should that be banned? No because it's a important part of history. And I think games could tell history and people would take it seriously, I also believe games can be amazing peaces of art and can tell these sad story's. So if anyone from the news or is against games, get your facts right or don't bother talking about games because you clearly only pay attention to some parts of games and not the full picture."
27356,"Well, the whole blackface Pokemon thing might have been on to something. The Japanese are notoriously ignorant about these issues."
27357,"If you're already mentally unbalanced/disturbed, I think certain video games can add fuel to that fire but I certainly don't believe that the games actually cause people to be destructive."
27358,Kind of surprised that Super Columbine Massacre RPG didnt even make honorable mention.
27359,"I've played GTA and MK since the 90s, but that #3 was fucking horrible. That was too realistic. Along with that one at #4. With that said, I agree that video games SHOULDN'T be blamed for the tragic shootings from these unstable assholes."
27360,"So when people use real guns in real life blame video games ? STUPID what if there were no video games what to blame ? MOVIES ? 
woooooooow so stupid"
27361,Australians are correct
27362,All these criticisms are puuuuuuurrrrdddddy retarded.
27363,"I love when people blame real-life crimes on video games, that's gonna look great in court .
Judge ""So what key piece of evidence makes you think he did the crime. Fingerprints? DNA? Did he have a motive? Was the murder weapon found in his home of car?""
Lawyer ""No he just really, really, really, really, really, likes GTA 5."""
27364,"oh does it fucking matter. when will people realize that games aren't series or teaching us to abuse animals or kill people but instead we pick them up to have fun.they needs to realize that people decide to pick up games and its ultimately up to them to pick up a gun and kill people, not because a game tells them its cool or fun"
27365,"It seems Virtual Guns are always to blame when people use real ones DAMN STRAIGHT, MAN, damn straight"
27366,The Press is so dumb XD.
27367,That's one of the multiple reasons why I hate 'Murica: allows free sale of weapons to everybody and blames video games.
27368,"This was all fox news propaganda, curious to note that fox news doesn't criticize it's parent company, 20th century fox, or it's merger company, for all the violent movies it makes, not to mention ""normal"" fox tv (not to suggest fox is normal) and all of the misogynistic filth in it's tv programmes - fox news is an afterthought now anyway and one hillbilly networks ""opinion"" does not, and will not constitute a ""fair and balanced"" debate, and personally I don't see the difference between violent news media or tv programmes and video games, fox news has proven itself to be a hillbilly network and people like Gretchen Carlson and Steve Doocy can never, ever, be taken seriously given their idiotic and hypocritical ""opinions"", perhaps those two should grow some nuts and criticize newscorp/news limited for all of it's douchebaggery."
27369,This is crap it not like its teaching u to do bad things its just pressing a button on the control
27370,Lol@people blaming video games for the heinous crimes....
27371,"its so ""murricaa"" like that the (laughable) sex-scenes are what's considered the worst..."
27372,Fox News....... Just...just.........ugh..
27373,I hate it when the media sensationalise shit like this. It was the same when Mr Anime killed his family and the media blamed it on his 'obsession with anime and manga' instead I addressing the fact that he had a history and mental illness and was a total gun not who had videos of him role playing and killing 'zombies'
27374,"First off : Video Games does NOT create murder fantasy's, people that are being annoying, that are being upnoxius and just pissing you off CREATE a murder fantasy
Second : If everyone would think like Congress in countries, we would already be done slaying each other for no reason
Thirdly : If making films about things that happened IRL is Okay, why can we not have video games? Because 1 man died during that thing? People look at video games and think ""Wow, dear jesus, this must be the cause of that murderious rampage"" while TV shows and Films have as much if not more effect on this ... for example, If I would want to cook meth, I'd watch Breaking Bad not play Grand Theft Auto. Video games are just to young right now, and you find it fitting to blame it like that because you don't know how it works ..... Dear government around the world, SHAME TO YOU ALL!"
27375,"most of this games are just ok and funny, but call of duty.. its disgusting"
27376,When will Americans finally face the facts that the ability to commit a homicide with the aid of a gun is directly associated with the ability to acquire said firearm. It's simple get much much tighter gun security and control and there will be less shootings
27377,Kim is in this vid :)
27378,"YES! it was those evil video games that killed everyone in a mass shooting! not the person's psycological issues or the actually guns and knives, no, it was the evil video games!"
27379,See this video proves that people who absolutely hate gamers will do  anything to get them to be like them likely in my town minus about ten to fifteen people like gamers for being ourselves and we are in motha f***ing Australia we only got awesome games banned because the government hates most if not all gamers for playing battlefield or CoD or Saints Row or GTA and yet most of these games only just make it to our shelves we only need to get a gamer liking government all over the world and only have wars in video games and have it less realistic and volla you got a almost perfect world and sorry if this is to long but it's all true
27380,How the fuck wasn't wolfenstein 3d in there
27381,Oh definitely the pokemon supports Nazism because of the swastika on the koga's ninja trick card but in Japan swastikas represent anything from nirvana to the Sun for crying out loud
27382,Nice list ( ^ __^ )
27383,"Having sex, killing and eating, those are our needs, we need to have sex, so I don't understand why so much noise around sex. Killing, we don't need to kill our food but we do need a sane dosis of ultraviolence sometimes, that's why football was invented, and action movies where everything explodes, I understand why people get scared with violence. But it's no a point to blame videogames at all, there are horror movies way more hardcore and no one bitchs about. True is that America has some issues with guns and with values, therefore, a lot of wackos live there... I don't have anything against Americans, not saying all of them are crazy, but it's a country with a lot of darky memories, some counsecuences must happen."

27386,Number 1 is complete bullshit
27387,"What about JFK reloaded, it's a game where you replicate JFK's assassination as Lee Harvey Oswald. C'mon."
27388,"Although I understand why games like the GTA franchise and all are controversial, those aren't meant for children under 17 in the first place and that's their parent's decision whether they believe they're suitable to play or not.
About the only controversy I can completely understand and back up is MW2. It's actually very, very realistic and regardless of whether it's meant to be seen as good or bad, your goal is to kill a group of people SOLELY BASED on their race. I do enjoy that game (or I did when COD wasn't the same game every year), I'm just saying I understand the controversy."
27389,"To #1 responses. You people from the UK are literally the dumbest socialist brain washed idiots I've ever seen. You literally do not understand the concept of personal defense from intruders and or the state. The reason we can own guns is so we don't end up like you. But you liberal communists want us to give you our money so you can take away our freedom. Get it through your mind that's it the people, not the guns. And the shooters were also mentally deranged and were on meds. Do you think that might play in?"
27390,Video games are entertainment. Your argument is not valid.
27391,"Morons now blame video games for crazy people going on a killing spree,
A few decades ago, it was the violent movies.
I can imagine some idiot two hundred years ago going bananas about how ""Justine"" by De Sade makes people into sex monsters."
27392,"Can I just say, if the media really believes that video games are a direct cause of mass shootings, one only needs to ponder as to why America seems to have so many shootings compared to say, Australia or Canada. We both have the same games. It's the whole debacle of mental health. It's something people don't talk about and the health care system in America is appalling. So just something to think about there. It's just not accurate to blame video games as a direct correlation with shootings."
27393,"Why is nobody looking at books and movies? There's plenty of violence there. Also, almost always the shooter in a mass shooting is mentally unstable."
27394,hooo stupid ppls -_-
27395,Video games cause people to kill? I think not games are a escape from real life if somebody was going to kill a other person they would do it regardless of if they play video games! The press just say it a games fault so they can have a go at developers for violence in there games
27396,Thank god i dont live in Australia.
27397,how about that bioshock infinite?
27398,torture game 2 received quite a bit of bad press.
27399,"what game was that, when the girl became naked in the video? :D"
27400,"Media is very ignorant,they blame it on games without any direct evidence to it only because the suspect""liked"" the games."
27401,"I just get really pissed off when the media, in particular Fox News, blame everything bad on video games. Mass shootings aren't caused by video games they are causes by a lack of gun control and a lack of gun owner screening. GTA doesn't make people want to kill prostitutes or rob a bank, and 'No Russian' in MW2 doesn't make people want to become a terrorist. Video games allow people to experience things they might never be able to do. I also fail to see why video games are scrutinised but Fox News and its blatantly right wing, Republican opinions and propoganda arent ."
27402,The only thing that should be banned is Fox News

27408,"If you pick up a gun and start killing people there is something wrong with you either you have mental illness or are a terrorist.
Government has blamed violence on movies, cartoons, comics and video games they are not going to stop it is just something we gamers have to live with. Thank you for taking time to read this."
27409,"@Steven Silva banning guns won't make a difference in shootings, that's like saying banning drugs will stop people from doing them."
27410,I can't stand watching these news channels who don't know what they're talking about.

27415,"When i somebody presses X on a controller to shoot, that doesn't mean that they will know how to use a real gun. Also, if violence is in movies and books, why does nobody talk about that? And why is it still so easy to get guns? You should focus on the real problems, before you go virtually."
27416,"Dont they know the difference between a virtual gun and a real gun.
Then only thing they have in common is they are both MAN MADE so you cant just blame it on the video games"
27417,"It is terribly absurd how important people can blame videogames for such things as terrorism and massacre. Videogames are just a way of entertainment, even if they involve terrorist cells, violence or drugs. If that makes an impact on someones life, it's because they have seroius mental problems."
27418,when people say: He is a killer he plays gta that is fucking bullshit
27419,"People all around the world play video games, school shootings mostly happens in US, I say It's problem about gun control not video games."
27420,Can't trust the media nor the goverment on good decisions now a days cause no can come up with real constructive plans ever
27421,"its fox, one of the most biast newstations and i dont even live in america and i know that"
27422,The ones I had a problem with were the no Russian mission and the GTA V torture scene. They went too far with those ones.

27424,Insane christians freakin feminists oversensitive racial groups corrupt politicians why you no shut the fuck up
27425,"Peta really annoy me, they've done both Cooking Mama, Pokemon and Meatboy game parodies. All failing to realise that it's just for entertainment and having a scant knowledge on the games background. Meat boy for example, they made tofu boy. Despite Meat boy not being made of meat, he just looks like meat. He's actually a boy who's skin is stripped off, representing vulnerability. Bandage girl therefore is there to heal him and help him. Edmund even stated so in a documentary."

""OMG THEY KILLED AN NON EXISTANT PERSON!!!""
""OMG PEOPLE HAD SEX!!!""
""OMG HES LAUGHING OVER HOW HE GOT KILLED IN THIS GAME THAT'S BAD FUN IS BAD!!!!""
Really people grow up it's happening in a non existent world and it's what happens IRL as well so stop acting like Sex, Drugs, War, Murder and Death and all of that doesn't exist in the real world and only in video games that you claim : ""are purely created to drive people towards doing it""
Braindead and religious people you just fuck off and stop acting like it's anything more then fearing your life means nothing you're not even a dot in an endless universe"

27434,These are the same people who support the nra and the same people who believed playing rock records backwards made the devil talk. The irony is that their argument has evolved even if they havent.
27435,"violence existed before video games.. every shooting is blamed on video games, but you can buy a gun at every gun shop and ammo.
if you ban guns, you kinda automatically lower the number of shootings.."
27436,"Not only does violet video games seem to get the blame for school shootings, but so does music, as Eminem stated in Sing For The Moment, and TV and movies, which isn't always the case"
27437,WTF Pokemon molest animals? Pokemon is witchcraft? O_O are those ppl stupid or just full retard
27438,"Haha, at first they make a freaking slaughter (I mean Fallujah) and they are angry because smoeone has redone it in more safe way, mwahahaha."
27439,great games.

27442,STATE OF DECAY IS NOT BANNED IN AUSTRALIA...
27443,"I think that the complaints against video games by these people are ridiculous. But not because of their actual claims, because of the people making them. After all, the people against video games don't play them, they don't know jack shit about what they do and hoe they effect people, they can do as many studies as they want but until they become who they are fighting against they can't say these things."
27444,It's funny how it's always fox news that complains about these video games
27445,I remember a game I saw from another list of controversial games in which you were a member of Ku Klux Klan
27446,some people are just mentally damaged when they claim pokemon to be satanic
27447,"If u guys used news footage other than fox news , this video will be less funny .i mean really , those news reporters can't be trusted. They report stuff that sometimes makes u think r they for real?"
27448,fucking crazy conservative weirdos...
27449,fucking politics...you can't play games because of some shit eaters
27450,"Also if video games are the problems for violence, damn I would love to know what type of vide games they played during the crusades or what Genghis Kahn played"
27451,what video game is that at 3:25? ive played it before but dont remeber the name.
27452,"Why does some people think that video games are bad? I mean really, you would pretty much know what games you're buying. (Just wondering)"
27453,Pure Bs
27454,"Being in Australia sucks, I wanted saints row so badly"
27455,the same kinda thing in mw2 happens in mw3 i thought that was worse
27456,I've played shooting games since I can remember. I have never had a urge to go on a massacre.
27457,The worst part of mw2 is that you didnt even need to kill those people
27458,"For fuck sake, people know that there is a difference between shooting in a video game and shooting in real life."
27459,Many of you might hate this but I'm a gamer myself and consider that the line to define which persons are mentally stable or not to handle the violence is almost impossible to draw. Therefore I think strict age restrictions is truly relevant and useful when buying games. GTA V should be able to be sold to unstable tvelve year olds for example.
27460,"When i was growing up and video games were simple...Films were targeted as the reason for mass shootings. You can not keep blaming in animate objects for issues in society. If you give some one a tool and they misuse it, then its not the tools fault, if some one gets in a car and mows down people, well thats the person at fault not the car, if i gave you a gun and you shot your self, its not me or the gun manufacturer at fault. Its your own fault, stop always finding some one else to blame. When i was in school i got bullied and i contemplated taking a metal pipe with me to beat the bullies up, i never did because i had control, but i can see how easily some ones buttons can be pushed."

27466,Top 10 bromances!!!
27467,"MK will always stick in my mind as the most famous and stupid of these controversies, partly because of it causing the formation of the game rating system (which in its self isn't such a bad thing) but mostly because the violence is clearly comic and unrealistic. No worse than say, the violence featured in 'Itchy and Scratchy', its-self a parody of cartoon violence."
27468,Bully. People were up it's ass for years until recently.

27470,"The ""banned in Australia thing is false"" I have been able to purchase Saints row 4 and State of decay, one from a shop that sells video games and one from the xbox live marketplace. I have seen saints row in shops such as target and K mart so you are incorrect."

When I played this I was like 5/6 years old and my mum used to tell me that it was an 18certificate game and that the 4 certificate at the start was to indicate how many players could play max.

27478,"Here's an Idea why not just ban guns in USA, how can there possibly be any more mass shootings. .. We did it here in Australia, and there haven't been any shootings ever since."
27479,Didn't watch it yet.. but is GTA here?
27480,"It's absolutely ridiculous that there is so much controversy about these games, especially around games like Pokmon. Jeez, grow up, violence is in the world and games do not stimulate these, that has been proven."
27481,"....please you gut a gun in my hand first thing ill do it pull the bold back (if available) and take the clip out. after that then I might shoot it if I am allowed
and on the other hand I play a lot of shooters and i have never shot a person"
27482,"It always, always the parents. The games have nothing to do with it. But some of these things in this list I do not like to see in games. No matter how violent a game is, a game is just that.

27485,"I understand that people complain about real looking games, but pokmon? Wtf?"
27486,Video games are harmless. The fact that guns are so widely available all over the world is harmful.
27487,I love Fox News. My favourite source of laughs.
27488,if boys get violent because of video games what about girls? huh girls are even more violent than boys but parents see girls like angels because i dont even know anymore

27491,"Probably one of the stupidest ones ive heard, is
Should killing women in online games be considered rape?
They define rape as, 'An act that involves overpowering a women'
Then they go on to say that, they are blamed for the death, it can have the same long lasting effects
human stupidity these days"
27492,I thought no Russian in mw2 was just in called for I'm glad they put a skip button in tht mission

27494,"the six days in falljah i think it was an idea with good intentions, trying to tell younger people what happened there, and the reason it was stopped was also rasonable, im not to sure about some of them though, as in Pokemon one, how can you get controversy over a pikachu?"

27502,"#1 is a good point. The media and politicians always look for something to blame. Just like music, namely metal. Because both types of media focus on themes that may create a bit of distaste in someones mouth, or don't like to look at or confront it, they instantly blame it. Oh, music caused them to commit suicide. Oh, the video game they played made them kill someone. That can't be looked at as being the only factor in someones mental state, and therefore the cause."

27511,I like how no one gives a s*** about what people think about violent video games

27517,"I can't believe that the gun link was number 1 I mean someone becomes disaffected with society or has mental illness what can they do where they aren't judged and have an outlet, play games and become part of the gaming community. The problem seems to be people who think that the solution to disaffected people is to train them to use firearms, and the powerful feeling this gives them, which they can't wield responsibly."

27519,"In the ""No Russian"" mission it never asks you to kill civilians, there is no penalty to not kill them. You killed them because you wanted to. Let that sink in."
27520,What about Postal?
27521,"pfh, well, lovely video watch mojo. you're doing good in this video. what i really hate from media nowaday is that they are oversensitive about this thing. yeah, there's a study that a game could psychologically reinforce ppl to become violent, but so does television.what, so you can spew racist, overly violent and mature content on tv, or movie, but not on game? like, seriously? in most cases that i studied, violence can be trigered by video game IF: 1. they have no s.o. that guiding them for what is right and what is wrong, and 2. they are born in a violent society. basically what i'm saying is, a lot of parent blame those ""violent game"" for their child's delinquency, when they won't even monitor their child, spend some of their time to understand their child, and just leave their child with their video game so they wont be bothered by their child. blaming the ""violent game"" for their child's violent behavior is as ridiculous as saying that delicious food is the one to be blamed for creating an unhealty eating behavior. if there's a negative impact of gaming for people, the media will be all over it like a hungry hyena. but where are they when scientist discover that gaming could become a stress coping method, a spatial ability and creativity enforcer, or even socially teach your child about norm if given correctly. heck, they even could make a therapy out of it. i'm a gamer, i play gta, i play mortal combat, heck i even play h-game, does that make me a town's violent rapist now? no, hell no. even my close friend would say that i can't even hurt an animal (except bug), and i'm the most calm and composed person in my major's generation (well, i'm not sure what's the english word. lol). to make it short, video games are the easy and simple scapegoat of those lazy excuses of parent who wont even bother to educate their child properly, and think of what's best for their children instead of their own, so they wont be blamed for their child's miss behavior"
27522,Fucking foxnews
27523,Yeah blame game on mass shootings because of playing games that involve people shooting people is childish too say people who play games that involve killing people it doesn't inspire them too go out and kill just because I play a sports game doesn't mean I'm gonna get inspired too skateboard or fighter and wanna go out and fight someone in a martial arts tournament just some people have personal problems and don't have the right people to show them a positive outlet or a way too find them help until its too late

27531,"all of these could have been avoided if people werent retards, media didnt constantly blame other forms of media for the bad to promote their own, and governments werent dicks to artists."
27532,unfortunately the sad truth is that when things like massacres happen people want something that they can blame easily and that thing just so happens to be video games
27533,"imo all those shootings are all like planned by the government or another country. just like some shootings were sent as "" warnings "" to the USA from Arabia. and i think that USA is trying to cover their own shootings using video games and mental illnesses, because people WILL ask ""why?"". its kinda the same with what happened with Hitler. Hitler was just defending and doing stuff for his own country like any other country but he lost, so to shut people's mouths the country says "" Hitler hated jews, so he killed em """

27549,Its bull that people get to blame video games when some nut job looses his wacky happy pills or no one even takes the time to say he may need help people just need someone to blame so they can relax there ass holes and jump on a band wagon its all people wanting to make themselves look better
27550,"It still pisses me off that people are blaming violence in the real world, on video games."
27551,"I know we've all thought it and many of us are saying it, but people are far too ignorant on this subject. I'm not sure how many of these people get jobs as ""journalists,"" but they should stop shifting blame to the wrong source or putting down something they know little about. I get the feeling they're just pandering to the overly sensitive and uninformed masses that populate so much of this world. ...And that is a rant."
27552,"I always hate it when the news relates playing video games to a ""mental illness"". 
""That person played a somewhat violent T-Rated game 9 years ago, he must have been harboring deep hatred and violence!"""
27553,"Man most adults 2day blame video games 4 all the shooting these days, it isn't because of video games some people r just like that."
27554,"Wow, people are fucking stupid."
27555,"animals, cavemen, bronze age men, cowboys and indians never had any video games. humans are just fuckin assholes, dont blame games."
27556,This list is about right. Maybe the whole Xbox One DRM bullshit should have been mentioned
27557,"I noticed you used a lot of Fox News clips, I see what you did there."
27558,Still love call of duty though
27559,The call of duty mw3 one was huge!
27560,super columbine rpg?
27561,"Look up: ""videogame violance"" by Totalbiscuit"
27562,This is the worst list I've ever seen from watchmojo
27563,"Instead of blaming music, games, movies, t.v. and etc why not blame the person who cause the mass shooting. People have the freaking free will to do there bb own actions not because you watch this or because a video game does it teach people reality from fiction instead of this blame game shit"
27564,5:56 nice
27565,You notice that Fox News bitches at this stuff first? Games don't cause issues!
27566,haha people are crazy their is nothing wrong with pokemon
27567,"oh please... even walking into a cave or flying implies ""sex"" in the dreams; disturbing images can cause someone to vomit. Images are so powerful, you'd think playing those violent games won't have any effects?"
27568,"So, religion and policy have been under all wars in the history, but videogames are the evil... yeah nice going."
27569,"It's not the game, It's the person. So don't blame the game."
27570,"Oh my god people are such morons, get a fucking clue"
27571,"I dont see how ""witch craft "" is in pokemon all you basically do is catch and battle with little unique creatures that have powers I mean seriously! !"
27572,"Everybody wants to blame video games for everything , but religion always slips away ."
27573,Oh my god are people that fucking sensitive?
27574,"Yep Hitler had to have played GTA to kill 6 million jews, why else would he have done that, same with Stalin. What about Capone, he must've learned his tricks from video games too. There has to be a correlation, because according to what these conservative dopes say, video games had to have existed since the beginning of time."
27575,"so if mature is 17 and up, what is adult???"
27576,such ignorant idiots
27577,"I'll name him: Jack Thompson.
Nice video watchmojo. Sorry for trolling though: Steve (here) and Larson from Machinima's Ten FTW did this top 10 first."
27578,gta
27579,this makes me sad to be Australian
27580,Why would u blame games anyway real gamers will stay glued to there tv anyway
27581,"Fox News: Fucking idiots.
The only problem I have is that none of them actually PLAY the fucking games. If they sit down and play the entire game, maybe they would see what they are about."
27582,Cod 4 nuke? That caused alot of attention in the U.S for being realistic and brutal
27583,8:04 omg people can be such IDIOTS sometimes!
27584,This is why I don't watch the news
27585,"blaming video games for shootouts ? what about action films that are loaded with those scenes, and other films that are loaded with sex scenes.. get the fuck out you lazy dumbfucks"
27586,That unfinished war game looked cool
27587,"1)Violence there was also before people started to play videogames
2)I think that the same influence on a boy could be given both by a videogame and by a movie...but by now nobody complains about them and you know why? Because they're used with them. Stupid people fear what don't know
3) You don't want shootings in your country? Well why the fuck don't you prohibit the sale of weapons instead of videogames??
4) Every game has a minimum age you must have to play it. If parents care so much about their children they could just get some informations and decide if it's right to buy it or not ,instead of blame to others"
27588,"People are idiots, always looking for something or someone to blame. Blaming a game for someones actions is literally stupid. If someone is so ill in the head that they carry out actions that happen in a video game, they shouldnt be allowed to own a violent game."
27589,4:57-5:30 jeez why must people always be so uptight...
27590,"Ive been playing video games since I can remember. From godzilla to gta 5, and I have never wanted to shoot my schoolmates or friends. These shooting are linked to long histories of mental illness. People need to look at FACTS before they start playing the blame game."
27591,"You'd have to be crazy to take the game seriously and try to replicate what you saw in it in real life. Crazy and a normal gamer are nothing alike. We fucking know driving through 500 pedestrians and laughing at it is purely in the game world. These fucking morons outright calling every single gamer that plays even slightly violent games to be suicidal serial killers. REALLY?
Yes adoption is terrible, cause your real parents left u for some reason, an the one they told u is probably a lie, so your whole life is a lie, how can it be anything but terrible?
Notice how these stupid questions only arise in AMERICAAAAAAAA, where dumb idiots thrive. I'm surprised the halujjah or whatever game creators didn't outright shout that newscaster was a complete fucking retard. Including everyone complaining about it. That game would've taught some young people about war and the people who had sacrificed themselves for no reason, is that what their relatives are trying to mask, pointless deaths? Desperately trying to make a day look like night. So sad."
27592,"Monopoly doesn't make me a millionaire, why does GTA make me a killer?"
27593,poor atomic games imagine if someone tried to do the same today with Arma III it wouldn't go well because they'd have the backing of all the people who donated to the making of the game and steam whereas atomic didn't you got feel bad that they where shut down because Komai did do anything
27594,1:37 dear God... some Christians can be such fools... I'm not just being bias here though because I am a Christian lol
27595,Polybius was a controversial arcade game that I thought deserved a spot on the list.
27596,I wonder if these politicians realise that the occasional person who does commit violent acts inspired by games. Are really people who suffer from mental illness and could be influenced by watching a movie or reading a book.
27597,"The whole discussion is obsolete if parents would care about their children and grow them up in a responsible way, but most parents are glad, when the kids play video games and leave them alone. I am 44 and I think I can decide which game I play or which movie I watch. Geez, welcome to 1984."
27598,i love controversies!! and i love mojo!!!
27599,"another reason tf2>cod
because you can't murder russians pedestrians."
27600,... And that shows why Pokemon is highly overrated & Digimon is better.
27601,thar is that in gta v i must jet to that part
27602,Australia: the place where you can get paid in the navy to do a boob job but can't play graphic games. I blame the kangaroos.
27603,"the end says it the best""people who are sick in the head cause shit,not pixels on a screen"" after i started hearing more and more about games causing shooting etc. i stopped caring about wich is better ps,xbox,nintendo or pc because at the end we all face some kind of stupid blame that our entertainment is killing this world and not human being who whant to watch the world burn."
27604,"I'm Australian and I can second that our classification laws are ridiculously soft. Import away, my fellow Aussies!"
27605,5.56 - coolest scene in CoD ever?
27606,The people that claimed some of these games breed mass shooters clearly have not looked into just how fucked the mental healthcare system in the US is. Also PETA can eat a dick.
27607,"I'm from australia, and we got strick gun laws, and guess what? We haven't had a massacre  in years."
27608,"i hate it when they blame games for a persons actions. The game is not the reason, it might be the last 'push' to a broken mind to perform such action. but a game can not be the main reason someone would go on an do the things crazy people have done in the past! (no offense to anyone but that is just what i think)"
27609,"It pisses me off how much flack video games get for violent behavior. Like really?! Why is it okay for an actor to portray a killer in a movie or show, but in a fictionalized game, it's wrong? Also, what were guys like John Wayne Gacy and Dahmer blaming their behavior on? Galaga?"
27610,I have left 4 dead 2 and I'm aussie?
27611,Same with gun control jus a hype for those media bastards to go full retard on
27612,What game was number 1?
27613,In my opinion you must be really close minded to get offended by videogames...
27614,gotta love rockstar
27615,"I dont know what about USAs Conservatives, but normal Conservative people around the world believe in rule that only person who did something is to blame for thing he/she did So learn murica Learn the freaking meaning of word conservative or just simply dont use it"
27616,"WatchMojo, where do you get your music from and if you made it why not upload the whole thing?"
27617,Half this shit is so easily the parents fault. You need to have them there when you buy the game and the salesman does say that it is not recommended for the kid. If the parent thinks it's ok then it's ok for the child
27618,"its sad when games are accused for shooting because there would be no shootings if there where no real guns at the first place
thanks murica!!!!!!!!!"
27619,"Conservative news media? Hah, an oxymoron! WatchMojo, you wish. True conservatives don't blame the game, they pin the crime to the person or people who commit the crime."
27620,This top 10 list is both interesting and shows a nice piece of gaming culture. There are times when video games as mass media to take violence too far but also show how dumb people are....
27621,"Its just ridiculous to blame games for shootouts, i mean, just look at the violence which is now and how it were before, people were killed all the time just because of their freaking skin color! And how often does those kind of things happen now?"
27622,Fallujah game controversy is one of my favorites I guess no one cared about the WWII realistic battles haha
27623,"Censor animated breasts; show uncensored clips from Manhunt 2.
Logic."
27624,"Most of these controversies were ridiculous. That little snippet of Portal 2 was just horrendous, it's a game that is made for comedy, not meant to be offensive at all, there is no reason for such upset."
27625,the far cry 3 ending in which Jason kills his gf?
27626,"Hate when they blame games for shootouts if games are to blame the movies should to everything violent should be to blame war, history, gangs, even books"
27627,"My guess for 1: ""Hot Coffee"""
27628,I feel like the media and news just look for things to complain about
27629,"Not gonna lie... the No Russian mission surprised the hell out of me. I don't even know why, looking back it wasn't that crazy."
27630,Can't make a game about a way in fufnav or whatever it's called without so muchhate but games depicting World war 1 and 2 (Where more people were murdered/killed/raped)and 3 given the game are ok and passed over by the media save for 1 scene in an airport. Sounds legit.
27631,I believe they blame violence in video games for the same reasons they blame cursing and bad behavior on music.....parents never want to be the blame....what about the serial killers that never had violent video games what made then killers.....and so when we go to war it was cause we saw it done in a game... oh last but not least what about the actual terrorists did they play a game that mimicked destroying two giant towers? Ahhh the answer is no oh well damn I guess cnn doesn't tell the whole truth
27632,"lol no russian, i remember that"
27633,"I played gta 3 and halo ce when I was 5. i played gta sa and vice city when i was 8 and i played mortal kombat when i was 12. I'm not exactly going on killing sprees. if u want shooting to stop, then ban the public use of guns. I swear, gamers have more common sense than people in politics."
27634,"Why do people complain about the smallest shit Video games? Seriously, I play violent games all the game and not once I've ever tried to copy what's in the game. It just depends on the person."
27635,"I love how they said multiple news sources, but FOX news is the only one used......Lolz"
27636,I dont think gun games cause majority problems. I think it's also how easy u can get guns in the states . And also they should banned owning one to begin with
27637,"Ive been playing many of those games...
Im not violent or anything, those games keep me calm when im bored, if i didnt have those games the whole town where i live would be destroyed."
27638,Why do they blame games why don't they blame movies
27639,you missed the postal series
27640,thats bull shit i live in australia and own State of Decay and Saints Row 4
27641,"What the hell? This is mine, peronally adjusted female Shepard."
27642,How about this america strickten the gun laws instead of blaming it on videos games and australia is living proof gun laws are strict over there have you ever heard of masscres happening in australia jeez . so america keep your problems out of video games
27643,Arma III definitely should've been up there
27644,"I don't believe that video games cause mass shootings. Yet, I do believe that violent video games do affect some us."
27645,People are just bitches like that always blaming it on games
27646,The terrorist one is hella realistic. Dang
27647,homefront
27648,i cant believe geqars wasnt on the list. YOUR COULD CUT PEOPLE WIN HALF
27649,"Those shadows of journalists and corrupted politicians should rather not do/command to do the atrocities games include in their storylines. The battle of Faluzza, for example, did happen and the game was based on the facts told by the veterans. The families of the soldiers may not like the idea on what their sons/daughters do in real battles, but denial has never solved a problem. This is exactly what governments do when they ban/refuse a game from being sold. Denial.Violence exist and they may be shown in movies/news but not in games? Will the politicians ever get a grasp on real life? Will journalists start actually doing their job?"
27650,"The Mass Effect lady was the funniest, especially when she mentioned that you are placed as a male character... She obviously didn't play the game past the start menu, or past the youtube'd clip of a sex scene."
27651,Only problems in America it seems.
27652,If games cause people to do these shootings why isn't movies thrown into the subject to because they pretty much do the same as games
27653,"Why people are so dumb sometimes?
These are just games,they are fiction,entertainment!
That's all there is to it."
27654,"I can understand some of the arguments in this video, but some are just downright retarded."
27655,"an everyone is right do not be blaming the video game market for what mentally unstable do it is that simple if you dont like the game then dont buy them for you kind if you hate game then shut the hell up same with guns,drugs , religion any thing that offends people will offend the i have a saying if you not offending people your not doing it right and the gaming market is doing it right lol"
27656,I don't think we should blame games for murders. Games were made for one purpose and that is to entertain. It brings about a world for the player that has never been seen and will never be seen. Murders done thought by the influence of games are not so accurate. It is the people playing the games that have no self-control and no sense of differentiating reality and fantasy. This is the main problem. Not games. I have been playing games since I was 7 and I can safely say I am a decent teenager who respects everyone. I don't swear and I learn to control my anger. So if you have any opinions please tell me.
27657,"Political Correctness is ruining society and taking away freedoms. I guess everyone knew that already, I'm just sayin'.."
27658,"i hate how news companies just blame all shoutings on video games where as all of that is baceless and doumb for me videogames calm me down and help me relax, now I know that people get mad at games a lot but tat is it they get mad they don't go out and kill because they lost they do that toger revenge for a broken home or mentle illness NOT video games."
27659,"God damn it I love reading these comments! Most of them are logical and rational arguments made by average people on the internet. So why can't these Fucking ""educated"" politicians and other asshole, God complex professionals, who are considered above us average people, make a valid argument?!"
27660,"This might be a bit off subject but, what about violent movies? Has anyone watched Rambo 4(2008)? The violence in that movie was ramped up to 11. Did somewhone complain about it? NO! It's always fucking video games that cause mass shootings and shit. If that was really the case, then explain to me how Hitler found Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 in WW2?"
27661,In order to cover bad parenting they blame it on videogames
27662,Art is meant to stir controversy
27663,#7 should be #2
27664,"I play FPS 6 hours a day, I wear mustache shirts and play with my chihuahua puppy. Video games sure do make me violent lol."
27665,"Mass shooting has nothing to do worth videogames, since these are played all over the world and we mostly see repeated events of mass shootings on the USA. So, instead of blaming videogames, why don't you Americans take a look at your culture which is the only cause of mass shooting...."
27666,"video games have no corelation to shootings or violence, you cant prove that they do, besides, mass killings have been around for centuries, and the nazis sure as hell didnt need video games for inspiration...."
27667,Video games kill people.
27668,wow the U.S government hate games
27669,Top 10 reasons why people hate GTA

27674,Micheal Atkinson was such a cuntbag
27675,"I wonder what video game Hitler was playing that made him start WWII? Or how many hours of ""Grand Theft Whitechapel"" Jack the Ripper logged before going out each night?"
27676,Fuck FoxNews
27677,"I find books to be more violent then a video game. God/Jehovah smited two cities and destroyed millions in that world flood. History is more violent, the Spartan life style was a bitch to live through."
27678,The stupidest thing about blaming videogames for shootings is that don't even bring up gun control or violence in any other media! There were mass shootings before videogames became violent.Did anyone talked about anything else than the suspects mental health as a cause.How about the guy who shot people at the beatman movie in colorado.I remember media talking about videogames a lot but not really about violence in movies.Anyway maistream media is bullshit
27679,Why can't they leave our video games alone
27680,"The felujah one is rediculous! We might as well take out call of duty big red one because people lost relatives at d-day! God, people don't get it, it's not real!"

27682,"poor guys at Atmoic Fallujah would have been amazing considering it hada great touch of realism as in shooting a civilian results in failure, the bitch in thevideo ""oh I lost my son"" yeah so should there be no WW2 games because someone lost there granddadon D-day, you won't here that argument"
27683,Kim!!!
27684,"That scene from cod, my jaw dropped!!
I can not believe parents let there 10 year olds play that!!!
Not that I haven't played violent games but I'm pretty shore cod was a little ahead if its time, that was disgusting:(!!!"
27685,All of them piss me off. The situations depicted in videogames are pure fantasy unless otherwise stated and even then (assuming the people behind it have some notion of respect for those involved) only show what was described as happening during the event or events being recreated.
27686,I am surprised Columbine RPG wasn't on the list.
27687,do top 10 watch mojos lists
27688,I can't stand it when people blame video games for violence it's not the games it the people and video games are great they let you tell a story be a hero or a renegade or a villain and let's be honest in this world what's special about anyone in a game your incredible you can be a solider saving thousands of lives or a worrier set out on revenge and in the end you find bliss and these people who agains video games can all burn in hell they say video games are bad cause they show violence the news shows nothing but sorrow death and tragedy so who the hell do they think they are blaming something that makes you a hero and see the light shrouded in the darkness and in the real world we are the light and they are the darkness trying to snuff us out
27689,"Im (for some reason) glad they used postal as an example for this,but it as only in the beginning,and shown for a short moment,to me mojo,you shouldve used postal as an honorable mention atleast."
27690,"lol ""portal makes fun of adoption"""
27691,"Firstly: Pokemon are not satanic, or witchcraft, or anything else other than a very fun game that isn't to be taken seriously.
Secondly: No Russian, while extremely violent and sadistic, was not a required mission. If you don't want to play it, then don't play it.
Lastly: Video games don't kill people. Video games are meant for entertainment. If you think that letting someone not play a video game for entertainment or stopping developers from making these games (and therefore violating their First Amendment rights) is going to stop shootings, you are what is wrong with this country."
27692,Modern warfare lol that was a fun game but what about battlefield 3 or 4? Those games mimic real time events
27693,hate those guys
27694,"The US Congress are a bunch of fucking idiots. Claiming video games contain satanic messages, encourage mass shootings and terrorism, and promote animal abuse is BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT, you hear? There's nothing FUCKING WRONG with FUCKING POKEMON! IT'S A KIDS GAME! GET OVER YOURSELVES AND GO improve the economy or something."
27695,fucking fox news
27696,"Just so y'all know, not all Christians are like that pastor. And if they are, they're more than likely a baptist Christian where as I am a Presbyterian Christian."
27697,"that bitch who criticized pokemon, stop brainwashing ppl wif ur bullshit man!!!!!!!!"
27698,Shooter liked to eat food everyday senate voting on food restrictions as we speak
27699,"Video games are like drugs. Once you play, you can't stop."
27700,Postal 3 being the most recognized game in California
27701,Damn this is all Bull!!! They just want something easy tp poimt to and blame amd mot blame themselves for not being proactive in thier kids life. My little brother the happiest kid you will ever see plays violent games but since we love him and explain to him morals he doesn't take any of it seriously. The media just wants a target that they can convinve people of.
27702,Call of duty realistic? HA!
27703,"Animal abuse in pokemon? Seriously does it even matters? You can beat the shit out of them with any human characters in all the Smash bros series and no one didn't seem to care.And they are not just animals some are materials,gas,insects,humanoids,aliens,ghost and so on."
27704,"The Tomb Raider ""rape scene"" was quite controversial"
27705,if you dont want mass shootings dont allow people to buy guns. when was the last mass shooting you heard about in canada they dont allow guns there
27706,Saw the mass shooters tend to like 1st person shooters headline and for a second thought I was hallucinating. like seriously who doesn't like 1st person shooter that's like saying murderous dictators tend to like butter on toast
27707,"that lady was absolutely right. true, many video games can cause problems but this country is free. meaning, people cannot tell us what we can or cannot play."
27708,Is it that violent games make violent children or that violent children play violent video games?
27709,"People are so ignorant. I mean some of the games that have been blamed are just plain arbitrary and in no way connected. Then there are games like COD that go for that shock value, which, arguably, is justifiable because the developers wanted to make the game like a movie narrative.
If someone made a movie with the same kind of action, people wouldn't care, but if it was a video game, people are gonna toss the challenge flag and complain."
27710,In the 'No Russian' mission on MW2 it never tells you to shoot...you just do...
27711,did you know that their was murders based from Edger Allan Poe works. Or how about the replica of murders with horror movies. or how about all the sex and violence in Shakespeare's plays...
27712,Americans are just retarded
27713,"I hate how butt hurt people get about violent video games. To the lady talking about Six Days in Fallujah, her son knew what he was getting into.. And these games are to slow people what it's actually like to be in the military. An educational experience. But no, we can't have that because someone's feelings for hurt."
27714,I like how Dead Space isn't controversial. It obviously has more violence than any games listed here.
27715,"Haha, Americans. 'Let's not ban real guns, they don't kill people. It's the fake ones we must go after!' Idiot right winged fools"
27716,"I just couldn't help but laugh whenever I see the words ""games"" and ""controversy"" together in a sentence."
27717,shootouts are terrible. it is true that video games don't help. but they are almost never the sole reason for murdering.. usually it is stuff like bullying.
27718,Anyone notice it's always fox news in the clips trying to tell you what you can and can't play or see....fucking trolls. haha
27719,IF VIDEO GAMES CREATED SHOOTINGS PLEASE TELL ME HOW THEY HAD VIDEO GAMES IN WORLD WAR 1 OR 2
27720,News stations are so stupid that they are funny xD
27721,"I have to 150% agree with #1. Anytime something bad or horrific happens almost always the first thing some people do is point the finger at video games(or TV and movies). It is insanely stupid to blame video games for the actions of others. It has been proven that video games has no major influence on the behaviors of people, yet the morons in congress always have to say that it's video games' faults."
27722,"Let's be honest, are any of us going to be like Trevor and drop are pants down, drink booze, make drugs and kill people? We're not idiots here"
27723,YES YES FINALLY THE LADY AT THE END GETS IT!!!!!!!!!! A+++++++++ for her
27724,Why is everyone in politics the most stupidest people on earth. Do they even realize non of this stuff is even possible and it is all just a means of entertainment and if anything video games they let people feel the weight of what they do so they won't do anything like that in real life
27725,i never got why video games come under fire so often when there are movies and television shows show just as much violence if not more
27726,Oh my god a man got shot LETS BLAME FUCKING VIDEO GAMES
27727,"The news exaggerate everything.... 
People that have that mentality that violent games make you kill people are kinda stupid  cause I've never perceived that idea by playing violent games and then they are some ""people"" that actually do it (some how It's ironic cause most massacres happen in the US.) that are mentally ill and it's sad because they can't distinguish reality Vs. Virtuality.
Well I probably know many people will disagree with me ( don't want to cause no drama) just an opinion of mine lol"
27728,I don't believe for two seconds that a video game could ever create a mass murderer. Infact I believe it does the exact opposite. Everyday when I come home from school pissed I just like to sit down and play some gta to vent my frustrations. Fuck everyone who thinks video games kill and fuck the retards that continue to justify this lie.
27729,"When I was angry as a kid, I would play a shooter game, Star Wars Battle Front 2. It calmed me down, not turn me into a killer >.>"
27730,YOU can't blame a game if someone picks up a AR-15 and go Rambo on their family members their obviously fucked up in the head. Plus no Russian was my favorite mission on the game
27731,i figured postal would be on here......
27732,"there was this one story when a kid that was 6 (he was playing gta5) shot his grad mother. the first thing they blamed was the game, first of all how the hell did a 6 year old get a gun why was no one watching him? but of course they blame the game."
27733,"but when in tv is brutal film that is rigth ?
stupid idiot"
27734,Postal 2
27735,8:48 THANK YOU
27736,"In all honesty, 6 days in Fallujah was asking for it."
27737,This is bullshit. I play videogames all the time and I've only killed like... 6 or 7 people tops!
27738,Playstaion users.Xbox users.Pc user and Wii Users.We all can argue for years on whats better.But we all join as one when they blame video games for real world viloence
27739,I can't stand it when political groups use the graves of shooting victims as a soap-box for preaching anti video game propaganda. If there were a direct link between violent video games played and mass shooting then American streets would look like a war zone.
27740,"They don't stop selling those games in Australia, but they still censor...the R18 versions."
27741,I think that video games cause less shooting because if you are really pissed off you canplay any game and let the stress out that way. I hate when the media blames video games after a shooting even if the shooter is mentally ill or something like that.
27742,as human being we were made to kill. We try to act like we were not but we were think of how many species we killed off not from global warming shit or poultion. Do top 10 species killed by humans
27743,"#1, I dont live in America, but fps games were blamed because he liked it? He probably liked the Big Mac burger, so why not ban that?"
27744,Of course Fox News is against this Fox News is pious right wing station that blows everything out of proportion
27745,The root of all evil is Fox.
27746,"Fox News got something wrong? How shocking... Hey, there's an idea for a top 10 list, do one for the top 10 lies told on Fox."
27747,So if I strangle a guy... Then people say that I liked tying my shoes... Does that mean that shoelaces are the cause?
27748,"Too bad that some of these didn't deserve the lies the government spread about them. But to watch everyone in comment section going ""OMG WHY BAN VIDEO GAMES THEY DIDNT BAN THIS OR THAT MOVIE"", just know you're just as dumb as some of the people in the video.
You simply don't know what video games did to you, so stop pretending you're some fucking scientist for the sake of defending some pretty shitty moments in video games."
27749,"People are so sensitive.
If someone goes on a murderous rampage because of a video game, it was not the video game's doing, they already had mental issues...the game may have given them ideas, but it wasn't the motive."
27750,I still have Night Trap.
27751,America.. why you ruin video games
27752,you never had to shoot them in no russian
27753,"Yes, the science that shows gaming to be harmless or beneficial always seems to be the far more credibly and fairly conducted, while the ones that result in a vague suggestion that they might cause raised aggression are always biased pseudo-science."
27754,nuber 1 is so right it is not the games you idiots
27755,I wasnt allowed to play pokemon cuz my mom believed the very same thing the reverend was saying and now she lets my 5 yr old brother play it whenever he wants
27756,For those who never played it. THe uncensored AO version of Manhunt 2 IS still available. The only place you can get it (legally) is gamersgate.com
27757,"Um Saints Row 4 is in Australia? Besides, it's the ""parents"" that have screwed up our banning system. But trust me, a lot of people are fighting it, hence why we finally got our R18+ rating, since we didn't have one."
27758,The amount of stupidity in news casters is TOO DAMN HIGH!
27759,"MW2 had the best scene. I never chose to shoot anyone at the airport, and that made sense to me. Even though it's a video game and doesn't matter I still thought it was wrong lol I loved testing my girl room mates to see what they would do without given any other instruction asides from what the game tells you to do,"
27760,Except you can buy both of those games here in Australia....
27761,the pokemon one i mean cmon whoever goes against it is such a downer lmao
27762,"old people are fucking dumb. they don't understand why killing people in a game is entertaining so they try and get rid of the game, solely because they don't understand it."
27763,In honor of Silvia and Weildman Top 10 career ending injuries
27764,What about people before video games had all these shit?
27765,Hey watch mojo can you do a top 10 spiderman villains
27766,The government and media need to cover other much more important news other than this bullshit.
27767,These guys on the news need to be reminded that VIDEO GAMES AND REALITY ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. What are these second rate bottom feeders going to do next? Blame Mario for mass genocides? Demand that Steam be shut down for encouraging gambling? Boycott Microsoft? Ingrates.
27768,I love how they blamed gtav for the DC shooting that happened before the game was even released.
27769,"I've always Hated these Anti-Video Game people. They're literally just sitting around one day, When a Psychopath Shoots up a Mall or a School, and say, ""Wow, Those Video Games sure are Violent!"". Like, Seriously. And these Fox ""News"" Assholes are paid to speak against Video Games, and Why? Because Video Game Companies aren't lobbying Congress. That's Why, So then these Old, 35-60 year old Conservatives can shoot some hot steam out of their asses and Get some Big Bucks over it, and How? By Exploiting the Deaths and Mental Illnesses of others and Making Video Games the scapegoat. All they're really doing is Creating a Martyr, thank god. Or else, I'd have NO HOPE for our Government If all they're going to do with their Taxpayer money is BAN VIDEO GAMES, Instead of Curing Diseases, Or Getting rid of hate Groups, like Westboro Baptist Church or the KKK.
Seriously, I am thankful that this crap just Simmers and Dissipates after about a week. Thank God for Fox's Ineffectiveness!"

27771,Fox News is fucking stupid.
27772,"i like how at the end the black girl says u cant just blame it on one video game,two video games...ermm how about you dont blame video games at all THE GAME DOESNT TELL PEOPLE TO GO OUT BUY A GUN AND KILL PEOPLE"
27773,"I agree 10000000% on number 1!! I FUCKING HATE IT when the media blames video games on the reason why the shooting happened, they never cover the shooter's medical background or how their life was, they go straight to ""did he play video games?"" This is one of the reasons why I don't watch the news because they absolutely have no clue what they are talking about and look really unprofessional doing so, God some people piss me off."
27774,"R-Rated movies with violent scenes released, no one bats an eye
playing a game with slight amount of aggression, everyone loses their minds"
27775,"Anyone noticed that Fox ""News"" is covering every single fucking story?"
27776,When are you going to do 720p or 1080p videos?
27777,HAHAHAHAHAHA ITS ONLY FOX NEWS.
27778,"What is pissing me off a bit? Is that Video games is rather helping us then destroying any of us.
Video games is like a interactive movie, you got 2 kind of interactive movies, one with choices or follow the story.
Now, Modern Warfare 2 being ""realistic"" about terrorism, (You mostly play marines). They really gotta pay guys to who actually play the game. You are following through the story, i mean. Does Terrorism have no innocent life to be dead, no it's not. Civilians will die regardless of goal, for this ONE SCENE out of the game is the actual true Terrorism event and not shooting a insane amount of ""other"" guys (Americans marine being ""heroes"").
Anyways back to the point, yes i realize the last gen (people) have their ways, and the current gen are not as they are once. But must we realize, in medieval times. Society had no video games, rather they grow up wanting to support their family or become a knight. This lead to less equal society and wars, the video games are inspiring people to have more of a tech position and not a marine.
You hear kids playing COD under 10, as stupid as the job is. Say I WANT TO BECOME A GAME TESTER rather ""I WANT TO MURDER PEOPLE OR BECOME A SOLIDER THAT WILL SERVE MY COUNTRY AND KILL I MEAN DEFEND PEOPLE""
Out of the billions that play games, a few hundred thousand is influenced by the game (and rather violence, most get influenced like Deus Ex (morals issues instead) )
Then some thousands will have bad serious events (leaving home)
Then a few hundred will actually do something pretty violent (Stab mom, big ass massacre, and i mean the ones that get impacted by this. Not a regular time player not is conveniently a serial killer)
HOW MUCH OF THE BIG NUMBERS (BILLIONS COUNT IT), don't go all GTA style. hmm???
And studies show, NOOOO. Rather the reason is how the person is raised, and real life events are the real reason.
Bullying is the major reason why, rather kids who bully a lone child. The child will grow to hate society and playing something like GTA (See, real life event), the kid might decide that society is sick and be put down like dogs.
One more thing, you know why people made death threats to the head of the R18 Australia game board, they didn't do it because of the video games.
It was a real life event thing, they didn't kill people. They were restricted and you were affecting their hobby, put in restrictions for fishing zones. And fisherman will do the same thing too. (Death threats)"
27779,"No Russian in Modern warfare II is without a doubt the biggest example of how Infinity ward was so consumed by greed they couldn't think of a logical storyline. I mean come on, do you honestly think that they would allow a possible world war III just to befriend one man and then capture him. its dumb as fuck and stands to show that call of duty is one of the worst gaming franchises in the market currently"
27780,BRING BACK PHANTASY STAR UNIVERSE SERVERS! https://www.change.org/en-GB/petitions/sega-bring-back-the-phantasy-star-universe-server-s
27781,exactly why I don't see how people love GTA so much
27782,I wonder if they realize that when they cover stories like that its just publicity that makes us want to play the games more!?
27783,"It's just a game, if you or your children copy and carry out acts that you have seen in a video game and blame that video game and it's creators then you're an idiot."
27784,Hmm well damn people from Fox News are a bunch of maggots i freaking hate them not all gamers are like that -_- sure there is some insane ones but come on learn realistic from fantasy or something like that such a pain in the ass.
27785,I want there to be a king and queen system in america..simpley because it would be intresting and the only fair thing in life is chaos and chance. So it would be fair
27786,Go Australia
27787,"No guns, no games, countless dangerous animals....... Australia fucking sucks."
27788,"This is Fucking Pathectic !! At the end of the day, its still a GAME, and its not 2 efend but 2 honor !!"
27789,"Media just needs a subject to poke at. They need something to blame! Video games are a ""new"" type of entertainment and that's why it's easy to throw shit at it. Before video games, media blamed movies, tv-shows, music and even books! I have played games for a really long time and I even have played grand theft autos in my friends house daily since I was 9 and I am not violent at all. Video games are my way to eliminate violent thoughts and it is a great hobby and helps you decide faster, get better problem solving skills, can help you perceive more things at the same time and for me, learning english"
27790,Jigga my Nigga!
27791,lol @ people being offended @ pokemon thats hilarious
27792,I hate people that says that violent video games will make you bad or your 2 young to play those games when really... It's mental health issues... The games aren't the people that are causing the mass shootings... It's us
27793,I don't remember what the game was called but it was a first person shooting game. It was called racist because it showed a white man killing black zombies. Like really?! There is nothing racist about killing freaking zombies!!
27794,"OMG I agree so much with number 1. I mean you can't blame a game for reality, in the 60's boys used to get bebe guns and play WW2.That didn't star the Vietnam war. And centuries before that people went to see gladiatorial battles and boys pretend to be gladiators or legionnaires. People didn't go around killing each other after that. My point is overall people tend to love violence and we've always had violent games, that have been the result of bad things. So you can't blame today's violent games as causes of mass murder"
27795,In MW2 Makorov never said to shoot......
27796,PSN has been hacked twice now that we know of.
27797,As you can see most of the news in this video is Fox News  which makes the point that Fox News is a spastic piece of shit like a magazine named the globe
27798,Funny how my comment is gone...
27799,"The last two top tens ive watched were Global warming is killing our planet and Fox news hates video games. Way to go WatchMojo. You have now ""jumped the shark""."
27800,Unsubscribed
27801,"Australia got the games but they were censored, unfortunately :P :("
27802,"If video games are to blame, what games have people been playing for the past 1500+ years?"
27803,"You guys are total bullshit.  The same coverage was given on ALL the news channels, yet you only show Fox for the negative association that will result. I used to like you guys."
27804,"The point is, fu$& you fox news, you use anything as news source"
27805,Notice how Fox News is talking about these topics more then any other news station.
27806,anyone know the name of guy on 7:53??
27807,People think pokemon is satanic?
27808,"i forgot the name of the guy in 7:53, what is his name???"
27809,the media ruins everything
27810,I play first person shooters and grand theft auto all the time and I've never killed anyone nor have I contemplated killing anyone. It has nothing to do with the game it's all in the mind of the whoever is behind the controller. If you're crazy to begin with you're going to kill people. Video games play no roles. If you don't want your children to play them don't buy the games for them and if they buy it take it away. Aka BE A FUCKING PARENT!!!!!
27811,thats so retarded about how video games lead to shootings oh man the killer liked games that must be it...wut if he liked movies or board games was that it too?
27812,Twisted Metal Black did not make the list? Geee
27813,people kill people... not guns or games..
27814,I hate those people. Mentally ill people don't kill people
27815,What about JFK RELOADED ?
27816,Video games don't influence people to kill fucking stupidest thing I've ever heard.
27817,Thank you for including No Russian
27818,"May I also add that maybe the shooter came from tough backgrounds. Maybe he was bullied or abused (physically/sexually). Maybe his parrents ignored him. Maybe he came from a poor family or was mentally unstable. To those who think that video games cause all tragic incidents, think about where he came from. Then judge."
27819,Why did this video say conservative news outlets? Liberals are generally the ones that personify things.
27820,also PETA pisses me off. they're a joke
27821,Plus all these news channels are idiotic saying games cause mass shootings or other shootings some news resources though know the truth and how video games are not the cause I mean rly we used to kill for fun in the past like Rome but we don't anymore all these shootings are from people with mental issues not cause they saw something that is not real
27822,"video games don't cause mass shootings. it's basically people just saying, ""this was a thing that he did that we can blame."" a shooter could like swimming, but that's never a problem because he also like something else like games. what bullshit"
27823,using a clip from the yogscast is low they are very unprofessional WatchMojo you should know better
27824,The news is so dumb they never played the game but they apparently know so much lol the one I don't get was mass effect and Pokemon the news just needs to stop by saying women mean nothing in mass effect when there is so much more then just the love there is so much more to the characters you can learn about their lives but some of these I do get like gta sa and it's mini game never put in the game
27825,The pokemon and portal 2 .... well let me take back portal 2
27826,"The ""he who shall not be named"" is lawyer Jack Thompson who has wined about the evils of video games (Grand Theft Auto in particular) for years. He thinks every tragic incident is caused by video gamers. He even said that the PS2 controller trains gamers to kill. He was disbarred several years ago. He is the #1 enemy of the gaming industry. Do I need to explain further? His head is still stuck in 1997 (when people still listened to him) and in my opinion should shut the hell up."
27827,"Oh FOX, you're so funny! XD"
27828,"The media is retarded and brainwashing, fuck the media which is controlled by the goverment anyway"
27829,"America has no problem with sending children to war , but try to ban video games -_- , pathetic."
27830,There were a lot of Fox News clips in that list.  Why am I not surprised?
27831,One of the stupidest things I hard form a religious group was my teachers are spiritually rapping me. Another was I have P.H. Degree and yet I can't figure out why there so much negativity over the net. Yet these moron still live in there bubble. Things like this is why I hate these people.
27832,"they blame videogames but never stupid people,maniacs,real weapons being sold to the public etc"
27833,I hate 3g
27834,"Funny thing, they don't even play video games it's like saying your a scientist and never taking science classes it's all bull I play video games and I'm the most least violent person in my family if anything it's preping me for a zombie apocalypse haha gamers out there agree?"
27835,Top Ten Glee Songs!!!
27836,"Construction games don't make me want to be a builder
Mining games don't make me want to be a miner
Racing games don't make me want to be a racer
Flying simulator games don't make me want to be a pilot
Why would a game make me want to be a murderer?"
27837,What's with these people blaming games for death and for Pete's sake Pokemon Is not satanic
27838,"I never understood why videogames took the blame for why people do things. I see most games as a visual representation of a story that you can play out, because thats what most of them are. If they can blame video games for a persons actions, why dont movies or books get the same attention?"
27839,Games dont make psycos
27840,"That Call of Duty ""No Russian"" was pretty messed up, but it was skippable, and it made sense if you played the game."
27841,"#4 This game SHOULD have been made. Everyone was ripping on the game because they thought it was going to trivialize the battle, but if you actually look at the statements from the game company you could see they were trying to accurately represent the battle. Besides, we're already up to our asses in WWII shooters reenacting battles and no one is complaining. It could have been one of the first big steppingstones for video games as a respected, artful media, but overpatriotism and people who have no idea what they were talking about ruined that chance."
27842,And where is almighty RWS game Postal? ^^
27843,I was once arrested for flinging birds from a sling shot at a hog farm. The police say it's because of the game 'angry birds' but that's just not true. -said no one ever.
27844,KIMMMM!!!! Yogscast yes
27845,people are dumb
27846,IF CALL OF DUTY MAKES PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ISSUES (no offence)DO STUFF THEN ITS THE PARENTS FAULT FOR BUYING THE GAME WHY DOES IT TAKE A 12 YEAR OLD TO REALISE THIS!!!???
27847,"One of my good friends is a big Mass Effect fan, and let's just say someone need a boot to the head, head facing the heel, about women being used only for sex objects. The female characters we're in high positions, played big roles in the story and actually relatable at one point. The sex scenes were just treats but not the overall point of the games. Plus I'm surprised the list didn't mention Rape Lay, that game got a lot of people talking at the time,even though it was never released in North America."
27848,"I eat my parents because Pac-Man told me to do it. They're right, videogames are evil. Everytime I watch some screenshot or gameplay of VGs, my mind cries for violence. I still remember the time when I killed my pretty and young sister using a slingshot and a bunch of birds. Stay Cool, Stay in School guyz."
27849,"Wow, didn't know Voldemort lived in Florida. TIL"
27850,"A couple of these are awful and should be controversial,some are just people being stupid."
27851,"I will admit at first I skipped No Russian but went back and played it. It is a very hard to stomach mission, but in no way is supposed to be fun. Its part of the story telling. But still really intense and graphic."
27852,Whats the games name at 3:27?
27853,man get me in a room with one of these mindles suits and i would tell them what there saying has no backbone in there claim.
27854,"maan, all the public shootings in the USA are inside jobs^^"
27855,cooking mama didnt make me a cook. why would gta make me a mass murderer?
27856,Welllllll... MW2 gets in trouble for 1 terrorist scene whilts Counter Strike Source/Global Offence is a game based around Terrorist attack?!?!?
27857,now everybody take note that all the BS news coverage of these controversies were done by fox news.
27858,"video games don't kill people... people kill people. Their choice to pick up the gun, their choice to go out and actually kill someone. Blame your gun laws not video games."
27859,"us in australia, we still get the games but some of them are sensored (only wicher 2 that i know of)"
27860,"Whenever I play MW2 campaign, I always play the 'No Russian' mission, but I don't shoot at anyone. Because, just like I wouldn't skip the scene from The Godfather, where Sonny gets shot, I don't skip the mission because it is important to the story."
27861,People bitch way too much about this kind of stuff.
27862,"I think violent video games prevent shootings. Fuck me, right?"
27863,"Lol, Seth Rogan's long lost fat brother at 3:42. Even sounds like him"
27864,people just cant stop bitching
27865,"#1 really ticks me off, someone gets shot and right away people blame it on video games, I'm not saying that video games arnt involved at all but most of the time, the killer is unstable and isn't all there, you can't blame a shooting on shooting in games"
27866,"Fox news are a bunch of idiotic arrogant bastards. And as for No Russian being on this list, let's face it guys. Everyone who played Modern Warfare 2 thought that was one of the best levels in the entire game!"
27867,Fuck jack Thompson !
27868,"I'm not even that hard core of a gamer and #1 still pisses me off. They do realize that video games are a crutch for those who are anti-social, right? It allows one to avoid true personal contact with others for hours on end. Anti-Social behavior is constantly linked to the mental issues of mass shooters/murderers. That said, statistically, saying that the shooter played violent video games is a rather moot point."
27869,"Kinda wished the voiceover for this video was done by a british person, Since Brits have some of the best video game personalities like Yogscast, TotalBiscuit or Zero Punctuation."
27870,"Pokmon, it drops kids into the world of witchcraft, teaches them how to cast spells, and is in all a world of the demonic... Seriously, has that guy ever even looked at a Pokmon game, card, movie, television episode, or even a poster? I mean, all the happy faces of the Pokmon must be death-defying for anyone who sees them, right? Or at least, according to EverythingIsTerrible.com."
27871,Jt seems like %90 percent of the time it's fox news who is blaming video games...
27872,i have to admit number 3 even though being a game kinda bothered me o.o
27873,"The vast majority of news outlets primarily care about viewer counts rather than honest, unbiased reporting. While the degree to which they lean away from the truth differs from show to show, with some having a lot more integrity, while others have virtually none (cough Fox cough), at the end of the day news is still business.
Beyond that, it always boggles my mind that a lot of other factors get so much more blame than guns when it comes to mass shootings. The gun culture in the US is ridiculous compared to so many other first world countries."
27874,"When it involves FOX news, everyone is pissed. Intelligent people from the lies, stupid people because FOX told them to. 'Fair and balanced' my ass. I really wish sometimes you Americans had a monarch that could order these idiots to shut their mouths."
27875,"Look out everyone! I play video-games ergo I am mentally unstable!
Ooooohhh, spooooooky scaaaaaary...."
27876,"Oh, I love listening to these free time rants created for easy money and influence! I wonder what other bulls they cram in my ears and letting them crap in it."
27877,"ZoominGames made a video explaining five reasons why video games will not make the player a killer. There has been no evidence whatsoever, people use gaming as a rather clichd scapegoat, killers lack psychological stability, the majority of gamers are not violent, and even violent crime rates are in steep decline.
Shigeru Miyamoto once questioned, ""Video games are bad for you?"" He then remarked, ""That's what they said about rock and roll."""
27878,"People should stop making video games the scapegoat whenever a mass shooting spree happens like Columbine, Viginia Tech, Fort Hood, Newtown Connecticut, etc. Video games aren't the only media that has violence, what about violence in movies and TV also in music that has lyrics that tells about killing and rape? Its really unfair that video games is the number one blame whenever a mass shooting happens in the public. The news media should learn that there are other catalysts that causes people to go in public and shoot people and other violent things."
27879,Thats why people think US is full of idiots.
27880,"so funny to watch these politicians speak like their opinions should be put on a pedestal, for reals though study shows that 98.2 percent of reporters and politicians have absolutely no fucking clue what their talking about when speaking about this subject., they never speak about the original fallout games which were the first games that allowed killable children enslavement, and same sex marriage(not saying thats bad but where were the christians?)"
27881,"I get that these are controversies, but MW2 ""No Russian"" as #3?!
Even if it was controversial, it was not so horrifying as to place it so high.
Maybe it's because I'm American, or maybe because I'm apathetic, but if you gun down people in an airport to keep your cover as an undercover CIA agent, what the fuck is there to get upset about?
He is doing his job, same as a plumber.
Conservatist's will always blow things out of proportion, but this was a landslide compared to everything else. Hell, the game even KNEW it would be controversial and tells you ""feel free to skip"", and still it comes under fire.
Just goes to show that some people are so thick headed that not even logic applies."
27882,Idiots.Instead ofaddressing real problems like mental illness and gun control they blame the games.But they don't realise that they are only making games more popular.xD
27883,The classification system in Australia is totally fucked.
27884,"I think people need to understand that its just a game, i mean that call of duty and other shooter games are fake. Yes I know some war games were ""based off a true story"" but that doesn't mean you should go blaming the people that made the game that a mass shooting happened because of their game. Anyone that finds a game that's an asshole tells tells like, oh what the hell, like CNN about how this game is like the shooting in a theater. It's stupid so if anyone can back me up on it i would appreciate it ."
27885,"I'm right winged, I believe that we are the guides of our own destiny."
27886,These games are not as bad as people think
27887,Also fuck you VGA's and media. Video games do not cause violence people using guns and mental illnesses within those people do.
27888,"To everyone out there who blames video games for some of the violence in the world, keep in mind that stupid people will be stupid people regardless of what games they play."
27889,I noticed that most of the media clips you show are from fox news. Go figure XD
27890,Pokemon also had some hate because it had religious aspects somewhat hinted in earlier games but then mentioned a lot in later games such as generation 4 when they introduced the pokemon version of God
27891,"#1, is the one that pissed me off the most! I'm SICK and fuckin' tired of videogames getting the blame, for these people, and their stupidity! Nobody can make you do anything. You're the idiot choosing to pick that weapon up, and use it. I play PLENTY of violent videogames, but you don't see me going on a mass, murder spree. Christ. -.-"
27892,Fuck the media they always blame the video games they are all like blah blah blah he killed cause of fps games blah blah blah. U got to play it to know it
27893,"Top 10 A.I.s from film, TV or video games
Good items for the list:
GLaDOS, Wheatly (Portal/Portal 2), HAL 9000 (movie that I forget the name of)"
27894,so much fox news bull shit
27895,I see an awful lot of Fox...
27896,Why is it that every time there is a shooting or something everybody points at videogames
27897,"There's this guy who got arrested and sentenced to 20 years I think in jail for saying something about going to a school and shooting up everyone on League of legends community even though he said right after ""lol jokes"" there's a video somewhere of it"
27898,that war video game stunt was stupid COD is alright but that wasn't?
27899,MoH there was a controversy over the Taliban in the multiplayer.
27900,"Okay, really? People need to get their heads out of their asses and stop being pussies about games"
27901,"Everyone just use video games as the scapegoat when parents are to blamed for not paying close attention in what their children are involved. And if maybe parents did care about what there children were doing in their spare time, maybe colombine would have never happened."
27902,"I remember reading somewhere that pretty much sums up the No Russian mission as "" Your not forced to kill any civilians, you choose too"""
27903,"This started off as a countdown of video game controversies to controversies of video games. What game got the last one? All of them. No no no, like The Highlander there can be only one."
27904,Fuck Fox News!!
27905,"@noah Allen.  People like you are a problem as well.  News reporters don't immediately blame video games.  They blame bullying or mental illness, or a bad home.  Eventually, violence in video games, movies, tv, etc... Comes up but they don't say it to be a main cause.  After an hour of reporting on the same thing, your going to start talking about random things that could have been a part of the cause.  I think violent video games could be a cause as well.  Obviously a normal mind won't want to start murdering people because of a game, but a psychopath could become more prone to violence.  Don't jump to conclusions just because you hear a mention of video games."
27906,we have a rating system for a reason. if you dont want your kids to see it then dont buy them the game. there... simple. and if you do then your the one responsible for how your kid interprets what he see's. ... there dont you see how simple the system is.
27907,"The PeTA Pokemon thing was just fucking ridiculous. More or less because they still think there a reputable organisation (and are - legally). PeTA is sexist, racist, homophobic (dont quote me on that one. Ive heard they are and arnt. Im including it for hindsight sake) and in all actuality dont give two fucks about animals. So the whole Pokemon thing just got close to 15 years worth of gamers to hate them, they really should just fuck right off."
27908,I'm so glad we don't have an equivalent of Fox news in Australia.
27909,if these killers keep using video games as an excuse they will ruin it for everybody
27910,"If you notice a commend trend, it's mostly Fox News who make the controversy. Why people take Fox News to be a legitimate news source still baffles me."
27911,"The Pokemon Controversy is just ridiculous! There're just the work of jealous people out there trying to put pokemon down due to its massive popularity at that time. I mean pokemon being ""satanic""??? seriously what the hell??? That's just stupid!"
27912,"mass media is full of idiots, fox news shared IQ of 15"
27913,#1 is one of those topics that pisses me off so much
27914,"relate games to mass shootings is a deceivefull idea, because they are trying to avoid the real enemy which are weapons selling to everybody without any previous mental examination. The guy who shoot those people in the theater in The Dark Knight Rises premiere was going to a psycologist and she warned the police that he was dangerous, bute they didn't listen and he aqcuire weapons by just buying them in a store!!!this people, the ones that commit these horrible crimes are clearly insane, not because of video games, but because they had a pretty shitty life, and they just fall off the abbys of mental insanity."
27915,I like how gears of war isnt on the fucking list
27916,Watch mojo is the shit
27917,"In the Mass Effect segment, you made no attempt to point out that the player character can choose to be either male or female, completely destroying the argument that the game is sexist. Good job."
27918,"Wow, r u serious about pokemon lol Dear lord lol"
27919,"Nicely chosen clip for the end there WatchMojo, that lady is SPOT ON CORRECT.
Mental Health is a serious problem in the United States that neither side of Congress will address cause god forbid, Republicans will use the same ""socialised medicine BS"" and the Democrats won't look at it because there aren't enough votes there.
Yet both will blame either not enough or too many guns, or violent video games while completely ignoring the mental issues of the killers."
27920,Lag makes us Mental
27921,fucking night trap again
27922,Fuck all this talks that person has watcheut video games making people go crazy and shoot tons of people. Like why does nobody talk about the violent movies that person has watched? lol what if they stayed up for like 2 days watching hobo with a shot gun or like the punisher. but nobody cares about that theroy.

It's like the reverse Pravda"
27924,Top 10 Johnny Galeki moments
27925,It pisses me of when people say games tell kids to kill people. No they Fucking don't. The game doesn't physically say hey kids grab that gun kill some people then yourself.
27926,"1:38, fucking idot...."
27927,"Wow at 5:13 those dumb idiots specially the women who lost her son now no one will know what went on and there stories won't have any spotlight where there should be spotlight, this would have given more meaning for her sons death pretty dumb now no one gives one fuck."
27928,"The mass shootings are just one giant blame game for the media. The are dozens, if not hundreds of scientific and statistical studies that will tell you that gunsand video games are NOT the problem. It is the result of poor parenting and mental illnesses"
27929,Notice how most of it is Fox news and smaller local news sites trying to get viewers....just saying
27930,In the popular game Hitman 2 you can toggle 'God Mode' and shoot video game folks in a bank but nobody seemed to care about that!
27931,Screw Fox News. Lying bastards.
27932,People and parents need to lay off the video game industry. The video game industry did their job when they came up with the ESRB. They created that system just for the parents. It is up to the parents to determine if a certain game is suitable for their children. Parents need to do their job as well and monitor what games their kids are playing these days.
27933,"Yeah, shit sucks, games being restricted in Australia I mean."
27934,"I am Australian and Have Played State of Decay, And i Had no Interest in SR4 but can buy it anytime for proof compare games with my xbox account Berserk642"
27935,Well pretty much every time they try to blame games for something stupid it pisses me off. I understand they do it just to get views but its still very annoying.
27936,"The thing that makes me the most mad is that THIS HAPPENS, sometime in our lives we all learn about this stuff especially the torture scene in GTA 5, some people just need to realize that that stuff happens every single day. yes mass shootings in video games are brutal but I wouldn't be surprised if over 75% of school shootings by students were by kids younger than the games ""rated age"" is. Parents need to be smarter with this stuff because 3rd graders playing COD is not helping much."
27937,top 10 snipers of all time
27938,I hate tv news when they talk about video games in anyway.
27939,"A decade long study on video games proved that Video games have no psychological damage nor does it cause kids to act out in violence. This was proven by and backed up by facts from the best psychologists in the world. So any news channel or any congressman that accuses Video games as the cause of a crime, can take those thoughts and shove it up their corrupt asses!!"
27940,"I completeley agree, its hilarious to see these immature fanboys argue over absolutely nothing."
27941,Violent video games don't make violent communities...Violent communities make violent video games
27942,The people that were the shooters in the shootings are mentally messed up the game didn't cause he or she was messed up to the begin with.Think about this
27943,fucking fox news
27944,dos the news know that there a movies and t.v shows doing the same thing fuck even the news it self dos the some fucking thing
27945,The governments and media just like to blame stuff that they want to get rid of!
27946,In relation to number 1 I believe in the total opposite. I think games gives people a release for the their anger because there is no consequence for killing hundreds on people in video games. Countless of mass shootings have probably been avoided because of video games.

27949,Man hunt is scary though
27950,Wow Fox News really have issues
27951,War games always get the blame for mass murder. It's because people r depressed or just stupid and the one about pokemon....seriously witchcraft?
27952,The Australian Video Game Classification System is a f+#king Joke
27953,do you know why news networks always blame video games becuase these people never had fun with it
27954,notice how much of this shit comes from FOX.
27955,"I hate how video games get blamed for all the shootings and crime. If you're too stupid to not know video games like Call of Duty or GTA don't transition well into the real world, you don't belong around other living people."
27956,I play so many violent games and u don't see me going out and killing people
27957,What made me piss off the most.........all shooter games controversies
27958,"while i'll admit some shooting video games can be a bit overexcessive as they do present potentially real life scenarios (GTA rampages and prostitues and whatnot (not giving my opinion on them as i've never played them, but i'm saying the objection there is at least based in logic)), but the hate towards stuff like pokemon is just ridiculous -_- ( i would know, my grandmother lectured me because i said my pokemon was evolving)"
27959,Fox News... bullshit
27960,Look if I saw a kid going saying come on just rip his tooth out while playing a game I would be concerned
27961,"Absolutely all the things that create controversy in video games have always existed in movies. and age restrictions exist for a reason, blame the parents for being soft and not being able to say ""no"" to a 12 y/o kid who insists on asking for gta 5 for xmas..."
27962,I'm surprised that Carmageddon only got an honorable mention. I thought it created more controversy than that.
27963,Blaming games like gta for mass shootings totally belittles the lives lost in all of the tragedies covered by the media
27964,"come on guys, i just want to have fun and play my games!"
27965,When are people going to stop being so damn bitchy about video games?
27966,I love that every news clip is from fox
27967,"Strange to hear him say at the end that the man defending the families was using other circumstances to defend that shooting. they are blaming video games over a long span, and things haven't changed that much. But i suppose its not surprising that such narrow minded fear mongers would also employ double standards to suite their needs. If media of any kind has a greater pull on your children, than the parents either don't know their children or need to make more time for them. Even if you are scared don't use that excuse to let your children fade even further away from you by avoiding the actual problems by not bothering to speak to them."
27968,"XD I have manhunt 2 and when I started playing my dad said ""Well i'm a great father getting a murder game for my 12 year old daughter"" I thanked him though"
27969,"As long as the blame game is around sources ofentertainment such as movies, TV and video games will always be the first to play in the game. I had a teacher back in high school that said I was gonna go too hell and that my mind was becoming corrupted cause I enjoyed manga like Deadman Wonderland andBleach and because I liked watching horror movies. He even said to me once ""That's not right and that worries me"" Cause I said I watch horror movie for entertainment."
27970,Eso esta en la educacion y la etica que manejen en los hogares. no pueden culpar a los juegos de reclutar asesinos
27971,Most of these pissed me off mainly because it takes a special kind of ignorance to think games like this are going to be the problem. Look at movies ranging from Die Hard to Hostel. Is the content in those okay? How about certain music? Or certain TV shows or Anime? Only video games cause the violence and the hate and the other stuff? Ignorance. Plain ignorance.
27972,"Yes, it's always the people that know nothing or even involve in the subject to criticize and degrade the games. Aren't people great?"
27973,I hate the whole video games make you violent it's the individual not the game I play halo cod bf and others I'm normal

27977,"Yo america... Instead of blaming mass shootings on video games...why don't you stop selling guns. The rest of the world pretty much doesn't sell guns to the general public? Put it this way. If I give you a phone, do you think you will be more, or less likely to make a phone call?"
27978,It makes me mad when I see parents on the news saying mature rated games should be censored more for the kids. There is no logic in that. Children shouldn't be playing games intended for people of ages 18 and older.
27979,Great List
27980,wait a sec im aussie and im downloading witcher 2 right now wat? O>O
27981,All I need to say is: Penn and Teller's bullshit: video games episode. That is all.
27982,"regarding #1,the thing people cant get through their thick skulls is that killing is a choice, and is not caused by games, books, movies or any of that stuff, shootings and murders are choices. just remember that people kill eachother, not videogames."
27983,"The point that I can't understand is: what the fuck is doing a child with a videogame for adults like MW2, GTA and other ones?"
27984,Petiole are honestly such fucking pussies like omg your killing people in a video game
27985,Notice how most the news clips are Fox News....
27986,We should honestly be considering wether or not it's right for this to happen in REAL LIFE . Not if it's ok to create a video game.
27987,"They need to leave my mortal combat alone!!! Fatalities, beastialities, babalities and friendships were all that. Get another hobby and leave games alone."
27988,OMG THEY PUT A YOGSCAST VIDEO
27989,"Wow c'mon! Create a list of violent video game owners?! Really! That's not gonna have an effect on somebody unless there already criminally insane . pretty much everybody plays or has played a video game before , it's not gonna change wether or not there gonna go shoot up a theatre or school or something . I'm my opinion they would have to already have something wrong with them in the first place . Wouldn't matter"
27990,Am I the only one who noticed that most of the complaints come from Fox News?
27991,"People with mental disorders having legal accessibility to guns....pshhhh, GTA V is to blame for mass shootings."
27992,How is manhunt not number one? It inspired a real life murder.
27993,"Video games are getting the blame for a lot of things because it exists in the ""generation gap zone"" where the previous generation has little to no knowledge about said culture that current generation embrace and enjoy.
A lot of things has existed in the ""generation gap zone"" that caused controversies like Rap, Rock and Roll, comic books, sex with contraception and the internet. But don't worry, the previous generation will die off soon and the whole thing will blow over."
27994,Doom considerd satanic? You kill demons and shit!!
27995,"I thinks it's funny that most of these controversies involve Fox News talking more shit. P.S. Video games don't make people crazy, anybody who shoots up a school and says video games made them do it chances are they were crazy from the start."
27996,People can keep blaming whatever they want to blame. It only shows that they are weak and stupid.
27997,lol pokemons ones... that one is funny as fk
27998,"Always pisses me off when you see a dirty liberal hippie shouting ""VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES MAKE PEOPLE VIOLENT!"" Makes me glad I was born and raised in a red state."
27999,"Video games don't kill people, guns don't either, PEOPLE kill people."
28000,I hate it when news people blame video games for shootings. It's kind of weird how there isn't any blame on movies and tv shows that are much worse.
28001,"Most of these so called ""problems"" stem from the fact that there is a high lack of information to the public. This leaves people to make assumptions that generally piss off the gaming community."
28002,"I'd imagine Six Days in Fallujah would just be a re-telling of the story. How is it any different to reading a book or watching a historical video on the event? Not all people who play video games are anti-christ, violent and disrespectful."
28003,It's Obvious kill people in the VG's makes you murderer..... that's why i watch a lot of porn... (Cross fingers)
28004,"Every video game controversy that has the american government giving their ""feedback"" pisses me off the most."
28005,the nra speech about video games was hilarious
28006,"With the internet quickly becoming the number 1 source to go for news now, it really isn't surprising to see news channels whore themselves out with attention grabbing headlines. ""Mass shooting you say? Well, lets blame it on video games because we need those ratings!"" I cannot wait in 10 years when those channels go off the air and become nothing but a bad memory."
28007,News reporters always think of videogames first when there is a shooting when really it is just that that person who does do the shooting is messed up in the head or has mental issues yet nobody will help them with their issue
28008,as much as i would like to see a manhunt 3 i will never happen. can you imagine a manhunt game with 1080p graphics? news reporters would go into cardiac arrest lol
28009,"whe i Played the "" no russian"" mission... i was like... WTF?... WTF? MAN! WTF?.... and then.... fuck it!.. Bang bang bang bang bang bang!"
28010,yea i'll go out in diamond armor and kill people with my fire aspect diamond sword
28011,M rated games are for mature people who understands game is fake and replicable in real life. News reporters have to stop blaming gamers for this mass killing
28012,"Next Top Ten: Top Ten Movie Villains That You'll End Up Rooting For

28015,Polybius. Enough said.
28016,People are just too damn offended. get the fuck over small shit in gaming. Pokemon is satanic? really? well if you say so!
28017,Mind over science .... Ehh that's y they think video games are at fault ....
28018,lol that game is fucked up
28019,"I kind of have to agree with the modern warfare 2 one, sorry but I think killing a lot of innocent people in a mass shooting is a little over the top. Other than that most of these seem kind of stupid."

28030,Playing Super Mario all of these years has turned me into a prostitute. Because we all know Mario was video games first profession.
28031,"People wholink video games to mass shootings or ""Cop Killing simulators"" have never played that video game"
28032,The one thing that should be controversial and banned here is Fox News! These are the worst demagoges since Hitler!
28033,No Russian was to survive the attack
28034,I would have put the Xbox One reveal/always online/DRM on the list that Microsoftgot so much negative reaction from gamers they were forced to completely reverse their policy and remove.
28035,guns dont kill people... people kill people
28036,Just to point out most of the stories were aired on fox..just saiyan
28037,"It really pisses me off how the media blames video games for violence. Of course they wouldn't piss off their biggest viewer base by blaming the parents who buy the rated m (MATURE! God people can't read anymore! Mature is 18+! Yet I've seen parents buy their 8 year olds assassins creed...) games for their little timmy so he/she won't throw a fit when they don't get what they want. Parents spoil their kids until one day when a kid won't share his toy, he/she shoots up the school because thats the only way they know how to get what they want, by throwing a fit to get attention."
28038,US news media is actually so biased its a joke. I mean they're embarrassing every american every time they air with their slander and outright bullshit.
28039,I still play mw2 and a lot of the others in this list
28040,Surprised no mention about gamers who die playing long hours of MMOs and stuff
28041,"What is the difference between playing a violent video game and reading a violent book? Other than the fact that you actually see the violence rather than imagining it. If people didn't take things so seriously, we wouldn't have these idiotic problems."
28042,"All these blaming games for killing is such bs i play loads and they make me happy and also not trying to offend Americans but you kinda go to war a lot but apparently according to politicians thats ok as long as now one plays call of duty as thats to blamed for school shootings in some cases that may have been catylists but not causes 
 it but not a cause"
28043,video games dont cause no harm to people the only reason someone will kill a person after playing a game is because they already have problems with their head already and they shouldn't be playing any games in the first place
28044,"Sorry, accidentally pressed the wrong button. What I was trying to say was Some parents buy video games and stuff as like a babysitter, even if it is meant for an 18 year old. I mean I play GTA V and I'm not going around stealing cars, fucking hookers, and killing cops. I see and hear children that are five and older that are playing COD and GTA. So in conclusion, I think some parents don't care as much as others about what they hear and see."
28045,Kind of thought Mortal Kombat was a bigger deal than #7. Maybe I'm just old.
28046,My grandma asked me why I play such violent games like GTA and Killzone and stuff like that if it caused mass shootings. My answer was another question. What video games did hitler play? She hasn't bothered me about that since
28047,"video games will cause controversy, but really? they aren't the cause of real life massacres and mass shootings. if you look at it, the killer(s) have mental illness or a history of violence, so it's never been and never will be because some 10 year old grew up shooting virtual people and decided one day ""I wonder if this is a good idea"". good job news teams. look at the facts next time, don't make up bullshit."
28048,"That bubble headed blonde on Fox-some people lost their children in WWII, some people lost their children in Vietnam, some people lost their children in Persian Gulf...where is your righteous indignation for THOSE games? Why are you not out there protesting THOSE games under the same idea? Shit, there are games you can play AS a Nazi for WWII. WHERE are people having blowback for that? The hypocrisy is RIFE."
28049,Video games does not kill people. Bad parenting and pshcological ill people do.
28050,Why not blame the parents who buys the video games for.them? I work at retail and we.had to argue.with a lot of customers buying gta v for their.kids...
28051,i dont think video games cause any of the problems that the fucktards on the new and other media claim... however i will not deny thata good game isaddicting.
28052,"STUDIES HAVE PROVEN VIDEO GAMES DO NOT CAUSE VIOLENCE!
But ""No russian"" freaked me out."
28053,"I think the first one was bullshit, there is a reason that these games are rated M because at 18 studies show that at that age is when people tell right from wrong. My father didn't worry much because he would rather have me see sexual scenes instead of death and murder. Really parents"
28054,The last one. I does nothing! Just because I buy GTA V doesn't mean I'm doing drugs and torturing people! People just need to get a grip like that lady at the end and think about the million other possibilities!
28055,I am Australian and our government is so fucked everything is controlled by them and the games are always censored no matter what. They treat us like babies.
28056,"Only in America. (well, and Australia)"
28057,Great list WatchMojo :) I was expecting to see Bully up in there though lol But solid list for sure.
28058,"What does ""no Russian""mean?"
28059,"A few thing about violent video game
1) stop using them as a scape goat: when mass effect came out everyone said children have access to easy porn(blue butts), only if there parents by for them
2) giving a mentally unstable person a game where you can murder thousands of people and then acting surprised when he flips out is fuck stupid
3) Austria why you so stupid
4)In the No Russian mission i imagine everyone where security trying to make me take of my shoes and belt(and for those of you who can't tell)  {sarcasm}
5) and finally if people want to ban violent games why not ban nude painting or books like clockwork orange or movies like die hard. Want to know why because to game industry doesn't have any big family names like Dali, Rohal Dahl or Spielberg, the closest people to them are Notch who's made one ""good"" game, Geoff Keighley who's the Dorito Pope and the other (unnameable) asshole how hosted the VGX's this year and mocked all but about to demographics.
Well that's all my ranting done for the jolly month of Christmas."
28060,"I just noticed this: Assassin's Creed hasn't been controversial. Like, ever. Think about it. Maybe I don't remember but, neither AC, nor the rest of the franchise has come under fire. Am I the only one that finds it odd that many politicians and anti-violence activists would skip over Assassin's Creed and jump straight to games that use guns? I mean, AC is literally a game about killing. Often graphically. Yet, it gets no fowl. Not that i'm complaining, mind you; I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy."
28061,Video games don't kill people. Guns don't kill people. People kill people.
28062,fucking news
28063,"Australia . . . we have the R18+ rating but nope we still won't let some games in, but here is when it gets funny, we allow Dead Rising 3 to come in ya know oceans of bloody spilled, gore, limbs blow off all that fun stuff, BUT NOT SOUTH PARK AND THE STICK OF TRUTH! god forbid someone does a fart joke and AWWWWWWGH! too graphic! to real! not sutible for kids!
DUMBEST RATING SYSTEM IN THE MOTHER FUCKING WORLD"
28064,These make me so mad due to how stupid tgey are. I go out of my way to play these games just to rub it in wveryknes face.
28065,This is just my opinion but in World Of Warcraft when you are max level and go gank lowbies you get this thrill of the hunt which makes you feel like a god when nothing can stop you. It may not be bloody but it sure as hell is something that makes people become mass murderes.
28066,"when I was a little girl, when the pokemon satanic controversy started, my aunt took away my pokemon red from my gameboy color, she said she would replace it with a better game... never did :'("

28070,#1 is dead on. Everyone blames it on FPS Games....
28071,"The Government blames video games for causing crimes these days because its their excuse for every shooting ever, they can't even listen to the science of it"
28072,number 1 is bullshit. what video games were the murderes of 1970s and before playing?
28073,I do not like that video games are blamed for every crime. Don't blame the games because the person who plays them and kills somebody is already mess up in the head.
28074,Most all of the media pissed me off because they are just haters and haters gonna hate the media is just mad because they didn't play games when they are children and the media is just a bunch of NOOBS
28075,"Yeah sure, some PSYCHOPATHS got motivated by playing a game, but once again... THEY WERE FUCKING PSYCHOPATHS FFS!"
28076,Agreed Sam booth
28077,One day ill understand how a person can live in a country that doesnt ban real guns and try to get virtual guns banned
28078,"like scream said ""horror movies does not create serial killers it just makes them more creative"" I think you can say the same about violent games"
28079,"Everything in the world has good and bad effects, the media should not be too quick to judge a fucking video game for all the crimes, I mean violence existed before video games"
28080,"(Rooster teeth) "" in a game where there is sex and violence god forbid using drugs for there intended use"""
28081,i tell people its a game its not real and if you cant tell the difference between real life and a game then you shouldn't be playing games in the first place also saying Pokemon is animal abuse when the animals are completely made up is just stupid and 1:24 that guy talking about Pokemon saying it teaches kids how to enter into the world of witch craft is just plane stupid and truthfully that guy can go well i'm not going to finish that sentence for the sake of there are children that read these comments
28082,"the thing that pisses me off the most is that i actually get most of my anger out from the videogames. if i am in a bad mood and want to hit something or someone. I play a bit og gta and kill off a few people and what do you know. i end up feeling a lot better, and it is not like i would go do that in the real world. it is only funny because no one gets hurt!"
28083,We have become a race of pansies. 'Nuff said.
28084,"I never understood why Doom was considered satanic, you're one man fighting against the armies of Hell, sure there's satanic imagery in the game, but what the hell do you expect to see in Hell, sunshines and goddamn rainbows?"
28085,This video only reminds me how stupid the conservative american media is. As european (spanish) I'm amazed.
28086,"wait I bought L4D2 and Saints row, and I live in Australia."
28087,"People are funny. Absent parents buys a console for his child. When the kid start actin like a jerk, ""video-games changed my son"".People now days really are funny."
28088,"People are getting shot because in US, guns are sold in stores. In my country, the policemen don't even have bullets so you NEVER here of things like this."
28089,"In the end, this all comes down to parenting. No need to blame anything else besides that, other than mental instability. Only one I had a problem with was number 3. That shooting was jaw dropping."
28090,Number. 3 was a bit much.
28091,"Oh yeah the GTA V torture scene was soooo bad... Nope don't bother about all the graphic death scenes of Elle or Lara in Last of Us or Tomb Raider respectively or the brutal executions in bioshock infinite or hell even the sex scenes in Ride to Hell Retribution, GTA V had a torture scene and therefore it must be banned so little timmy and stay safe and play kid friendly mature rated games... blah blah blah.
Seriously open your fucking eyes. GTA V is rated r-18 in australia for a reason. IT IS NOT A GAME FOR 8 YEAR OLD LITTLE TIMMY. ITS FOR ADULTS!!!
If Manhunt 2 was rated adults only I would be very happy because then parents won't have to start shouting for the game to be banned."
28092,"The only one that had only valid basis is Manhunt (specifically the wii version) but even then, it's a moot point, as anyone in their right minds would not attempt such things"
28093,The only thing Mortal Kombat wanted me to do was take martial arts and learn about their history... Also see if I can throw a spear like scorpion or execute a perfect bicycle kick like liu kang
28094,"Wouldn't banning the guns used in shootings stop them better than banning games that weren't used in the crimes at all?  I'm not saying that some games aren't incredibly violent or don't deserve 18+ ratings, but I think real weapons are more dangerous than virtual ones.  That's just my two cents though..."
28095,"The MK games are my favorite video games of all time and i assure you that if you ever met me, i'd be one of the nicest, most non-violent persons you've ever met."
28096,"I can speak for Germany when I say that if you shot a civilian at the airport in ""No Russian"", you had to start over again from the last checkpoint with a message that you can't shoot civilians."
28097,"I knew MW2 was going to be on there, just because when it came out i was like 'oh shit you can do that?!?"""
28098,the no russian mission is my favorite mission in mw2. when i grow up i wanna do the same thing!... is that really what the adults/grown ups think about us gamers? really?
28099,"media is fearmongering shooters, dont lisen to them"
28100,so fox supports real guns but not fake guns
28101,"Omg why do they blame video games for mass shootings and violence?!? There is so much evidence against it it's not even funny. These people just won't admit that it's the availability to guns, the upbringing of the person or the person's environment or surroundings that is the problem. Far out, get a life morons"
28102,What about Imagination is the Only Escape?
28103,"Sometimes North-Americans overreact on things. Like a offensive jokes and shooters. Myself don't give a damn about what happens in the game. It's soppused to be entertaining. I know some people are very ""scratter"" minded and depressed over something."
28104,"we play all these violents games her in mexico and we have our ""daily shootouts"" cops vs gangs but you dont see mexican civilians or students killing children in our country.... I really dont understand whats the difference with usa that have this mass shootout in schools"
28105,"Fuck the conservative news media, fuck Australia, fuck Florida and fuck old people who sit around and complain about games although they don't play them.if you don't like the content don't buy it or allow your children too, that's your responsibility"
28106,"The real problem here seems to be Fox News, fucking yellow press."
28107,so funny how they dont blame the parents lol
28108,Fox News is full of dumb fucks. This video proves the fact that I just typed.
28109,Can the fucking news media fuck the fuck up about games. Video games are made for fun I don't know why the fucking news have to stick their faces in our business
28110,8:30 is the best part of the video.
28111,Who is the certain advocate in Florida that shall not be named? Send me the answer via direct message through youtube or gmail. I am curious.
28112,So much Fox News :L
28113,"The RTL coverage of the gamescom!!!
i went mental over the ignorance!"
28114,"Soooooooo... to call out a game for supposedly making fun of adoption, they use a scene where the bad guy is doing that and then another character is defending you? Das 'Murica right thur fur ya."
28115,"The people that say video games need to be banned due to violence need to think about the members in the military who are protecting her freedoms. Nowadays it is quite hard to find a male in the military that doesn't enjoy a violent video game now and then. Not saying all, but most."
28116,"Its funny how the media always brings up how insert name  went on a mass shooting rampage and it was becuz they played violent video games.. That's bullshit,that's like saying cuz I play Soul Calibur imma get dressed take one of my katanas then go out killing people...cuz i played a violent game :| Put the blame on the sick fuck of a person. Not video games..videos games don't kill people,people kill people."
28117,Controversy in Pokemon i quit
28118,oh look. Fox clips in every entry. Could that mean that there is no controversy? Just Fox being Fox? They're going to be so screwed in 20-30 years when the older generations die off and the younger people don't take their bullshit.
28119,Remember No Russian!
28120,"This made me sick. Some people are just too stupid to breathe, let alone bash video games."
28121,"Some governments can't accept the fact gun crimes happen due to the killer being deranged and evil. When i get mad at videogames (which i rarely do) i usually just sigh heavily, or swear, but also not strongly. just the odd ""twat"" or ""shit"""
28122,"This is actually a great list that I cannot complain on (no offense Mojo, but your recent videos were only decent). Though I think MadWorld would be on this list (a Wii exclusive adault game?). But as I stated, a great list"
28123,Thrill Kill on the PS!
28124,Top 10 sports rivalries
28125,"It's sad how the media cares more about small sex scenes and some bloody violence rather than parents buying their kids M games and piracy, but no, its always the small things."
28126,"I play Battlefield, going up to people and sticking knives through their necks, and nobody has ever done this in real life based off of a video game... Video games may cause some of this however, but mainly in unstable people with mental issues, so why not have a check on people to make sure that they don't have some kind of disease causing them to be violent, before they are able to buy a violent video game?... If the government or something banned violent video games some how, there would be more controversy than there is now about the subject. I don't know as to where I would be going with this comment, than to state my opinion :)"
28127,can i slap some news casters please
28128,"Ah, conservatives...
you so silly!"
28129,The whole thing about the Grand Theft Auto thing is stupid because the parents shouldn't let the kids play it in the first place. Unless they are the appropriate age
28130,Why do we need FOX NEWS?
28131,"*hookers not hikers, that would be a bot weird..."
28132,No Russian was my favorite mission in MW2... o_o
28133,A recent article on the UK news site The Guardian has outright blamed the death of a prostitute on GTA5 despite the fact that it has been scientifically proven that she dies from a drug overdose after multiple years of drug abuse. the author of the article states that because you can have sex with hikers and kill them in GTA5 anyone who played the game will inevitably go around doing the same in real life when the example used's death had nothing to do with games at all but the misuse of drugs!
28134,If you are right in the mind you can distinguish the differences in video games and real life. A normal person who plays video games knows they can't go and shoot people in real life just because they do it in the game. Someone who has phsycological problems may not see the distinction between real life and video games and could possibly kill people but to say that video games corrupt kids and make them want to kill people is rediculous.
28135,Fox News just likes to start shit that no one cares about.
28136,Was that Kim
28137,"ok so a lot of ppl think that ""violent"" videogames are bad....then tell me: What god damn game have we humans played over and over again for them to anger us and make us do these wars? (medieval and modern alike)"
28138,"what next? a man killed a kid with a steel chair, the next day the media blames wrestling."
28139,Just because the media has a title And a name doesn't mean its true that games make kids go crazy or how they say it makes kids go crazy its still a opinion not 100% true yea we rage when we get noobtubed or quickscoped but just because I got quick scoped doesn't and rage doesn't mean I'm crazy
28140,Also 100% mentally stable. And we're video games the reason Charles Whitman went on the Austin campus bell tower and sniped 18 people including an unborn baby? No.
28141,"Dana Plato in 'Night Trap', interesting. . ."
28142,I hate it when someone kills someone then the police and journalists find out that he had an console and plays games like battlefield and call of duty and GTA then that becomes the reason he did it which is stupid if they say they did it because u do it in manhunt they yh that's prove but I hate it when they straight up blame it on the fact he was a gamer he could of had a mental problem before he started gaming
28143,yeah videogames are always to blame cause fuck it i played god of war at the age of 7 and I am the best srudent in school I am large an thug but don't like getting is fight despite I played 10-s of games blaming games is just moronic
28144,"GTA: San Andreas scandal was really retarded. It's not going to happen in the game unless you download external files from the web so why complain. And if people complain about that, then they might as well complain about all those nude mods people create for various games. It's the same principal, you download some external files from the web and all Skyrim female NPCs for instance are flashing their boobies. But nope, people consider mods as the actual part of the retail game."
28145,"Religious Conservatives ruin everything. Don't care how many people disagree with that, because it's true anyways. Pokemon teaches kids to be demonic? Please kill yourself."
28146,"Maybe it ought to be blamed on the people who want to regulate the VIRTUAL guns, but not the REAL ONES!"
28147,"never actually seen ""hot coffee"" in motion, really? that was what they were freaking out over? it's like slapstick..."
28148,"people's son's died in that battle' no shit, people's son's died in WW2 but WW2 games get no shit for it"
28149,wut?
28150,"I can not fucking stand when people look at people who play GTA, Call of Duty, or fucking Battlefield and say they are serial killers. That pisses me off to no end. Not only is it because the main reason for school shootings a MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE, but also when developers make these games, they don't make them with the intend to create murderers. They make them for FUN, they make them so people have something to do to waste time and as a distraction. Please, if you are one of these idiots who really believe video games make people want to kill someone, consider the fact that Call of Duty is one of the most popular games out there ( whether or not it's a good game is a whole other story ). If there are millions of people who play that, then you would think that there would be way more murders than there are right now. Truth be told, crimes like that have actually gone down, and video games has been linked to that steady decline ( which would also explain why there are so many shitty people on the internet, but again, that doesn't matter)"
28151,"Pokemon black face pissed me off the most! and to all the people who think original jinx is bad or ""racist"" you need to Stfu because not everything is connected to racism"
28152,I'm sorry but if the American government does not get rid of guns these mass shootings will continue no matter who they blame
28153,Ewwwwww...
28154,The woman at the end of the video has the right idea.
28155,game GTA san I see sex
28156,This game killer I Don't like :)
28157,game killer
28158,"i think that blaming vidoe games for mass shootings is stupid a lot of people play ""violent"" video games and not even one percent of them ever commit a crime so those who blame them are stupid"
28159,"I absolutely hate it when TV news or congressmen bash video games and say it is the cause of violence or demeaning to women, corrupting youth... any of that shit. Fuck, just turn on basic cable and you can see 10x worse. Like that God awful softcore porn Two and a Half Men garbage or people getting killed on all those murder investigation and cop shows."
28160,six days in fallujah is stupid.
28161,and I got GTA 4 :) Im play is not working :(
28162,I think this game so cool in game :D
28163,Dear warchmojo When I found your channel I enjoyed your work I found out you can send in suggestions so I loged in type in all the information I press login and all it did was send me back to the same thing now I have to do it again I did it it did'nt work the same thing happen so what do I do?
28164,I notice that most of the News coverage comes from Fox news
28165,i like how they don't point any fingers at movies
28166,"Top Ten spoiler filled Breaking Bad Moments

28167,"Here in Australia, we do have State of Decay and Saints Row IV. Both had problems with 'drug use'. State of Decay got the R18+ rating they talked about for high level violence and Saints Row IV got the second worst rating (MA 15+) with drug use only being moderate impact rather than strong impact. I don't get it."
28168,"Yes I think that some games have a scenario which is to much or not neccesary for the story of the game. A good example was the MW2 mission. Where each time I played it I was like like mhhmmm... They could have also not done it. However this never made me think that this would be a reason or a ""trigger"" for people to go out and commit similar crimes or recreate similar events that they have seen in a video game in real life."
28169,"I hate how the media industry bashes games. With Grand Theft Auto sure you can go on a rampage, but there are ramifications to every bad act you do. Why does the media only target video games? With the Columbine massacre it was doom, but you barley heard about the guy who sold Dylan and Harris the guns. Also I have bipolar disorder and depression, I don't want some news reporter trying to Speak for me."
28170,"i hate people... been playing games my whole life, played games where you kil people, played games where you fight people, played even games where you kil animals BUT I HAVE NEVER hurt even hit a dude yet and i sertently havent kiled any animals sigh... they talk about games, they talk about games like it is drugs ore alcohol"
28171,Games make people so butthurt lol
28172,Screw fox news
28173,"A man named Tristan van der Vlis shot multiple civilians in a mall in Holland and then committed suicide. He was inspired by the No Russian level in Modern Warfare 2. Eventually, the police found that he was obsessed with weaponry and violence. He was also mentally unstable. I don't think it is right to blame Infinity Ward for that. The parents should be blamed for letting their mentally ill son buy firearms and be influenced so easily."
28174,"The funny thing with MW2 is that in No Russian, there is nothing making you pull the trigger, you can go through the whole first part of the level without shooting a single round"
28175,its sad that we live in the worl full off people with their minds super close to their opinion
28176,"Kind of stupid when the news talk about the ""Controversial"" video games the media is full of hypocrites when they promote these games."
28177,game killer a lot.
28178,"Idiots. Idiots everywhere.
Damn, I remember playing Manhunt, with a friend, never had I seen so much gore, violence, and blood anywhere else. Played it, loved it, that's it. No bullshit psychological damage or whatever these pansies are talking about."
28179,"With over 22 million gamers, if video games really lead to mass shootings then ganers would be the only ones left. So its infact COMPLETELY FUCKING RETARDED, to say that videogames lead to mass shootings"
28180,It's a lot easier to pin the blame on someone else for not raising your kid or no keeping track of what he/she watches or plays.

28184,What about every gta release the day a new gta comes out and someone gets murdered the news always blame gta even if the murderer doesn't even know what gta is.

28188,"Mass Effect ""Sex Scenes"", AKA, dull as hell and you only sleep with one person. Plenty of movies with just an R rating (basically the same as the M Rating of the game) have raunchier stuff than Mass Effect. Such whiny bastards. As if the game focuses on sex. Bah! Play it for yourself before judging."
28189,"this pisses me off. why does the press always have to have to bash on videos games. they always say that ""oh if you play gta you'll become a serial killer."" why dont they do it to movies? it just doesnt make sense."
28190,"Notice how in most of the controversies, it's Fox News talking about the story."
28191,"So this pretty cool sounding fps game gets shat on while Call of Duty, Brothers in arms, Medal of Honour and battlefield have depicted countless battles and wars whether it be actual battles from the past or not. I'm not even going to mention the millions of shitty war films out there. Americans are so blinded by their patriotism that they immediately shun things whenever they are portrayed in bad taste.
And ""GTA and Manhunt are so bad, they damage children mentally"". Well if you believe that why are you letting your children play them? They have a high ESRB rating for a fucking reason. There's not even an excuse for the original MK! It's called Mortal Kombat for fuck sakes, there's obviously going to be violence and blood in it. Maybe they shouldn't have expected so much violence from one game but if you're upset by what you're seeing don't play it and don't let your kids play it.
It's why I don't understand the reasoning behind the hatred for comedy shows like south park. They're meant to be dark and offensive but people who're faint of heart still watch it then try and sue them when they hear something they don't like.
The ""video games cause mass shootings"" and other violent crimes is just, as a lot of people in this comments section have said, bullshit. It is just a scapegoat the media and people of power use to push the focus off the fact that theworld and it's communities have some very sick and twisted fucking assholes out there and it's easy to blame something that is quite frankly, easy to blame. There have been countless studies spanning decades and even more that prolonged exposure to violent video games does not alter the behaviour of children and young adults. Yet the media and other people seem to blame video games to no end.
Anyway rant over. Sorry to anybody who sat through this whole comment. xD"
28192,"lol 5:28 ""yh...b...yh..bu.."" what?"

28196,"I live in Australia, and the amount games that we censor or ban for being ""too violent"" or ""highly inappropriate"" are WAY too high. Left 4 dead, Syndicate (banned), Saints Row IV. Even though Australia have an R rating for many games such as Grand Theft Auto V and Mortal Kombat they still find the need to change newer releases, such as South Park the Stick of Truth will be censored when it's released, and Saints Row IV for having minor drug use and an ""Anal Probe weapon"". And that's why i'm saying this.
Fuck you Australia, you find a way to ruin gamers fun every time we hear about an amazing new game coming soon. That's my rant done, back to the video."
28197,8:40 That's the first person I've ever seen on an actual news channel who understands that video games aren't to blame.

OH AND ONLY WHITE PEOPLE WOULD THINK THAT VIDEO GAMES ARE BAD FOR YOU..."

28241,"Soo what if I play a sports game im gonna be a super athlete? Stupid controversy. ""I killed someone in a video game, YAY IM GONNA DO THAT IN REAL LIFE""!!! Sayd no one ever!!!"
28242,I think that especially US americans should change theor gun laws before they blame video games
28243,"what's funny is the fact that all these mass shootings only happen in america, the land of limitless firearms, yet videogames are international."
28244,MK should be #1
28245,My god all those people are fucking idiots. Those games are for MATURE AUDIENCES!! Besides i've been playing GTA since I was a kid and nothing bad has happened.
28246,The news just needs a topic and video games are just the only thing they can think of to blame shootings for.
28247,Every one...
28248,I wonder how many murderers/terrorists that are addicted to cigarettes or drugs or liquor or...the list goes on and on. It depends on how well the parents raises their kids.
28249,"People sometimes can't accept someone's action like shooting and killing innocent people on there own free will, they don't want to accept someone can be that psychotic or heartless.
they want explanations on why they did or what influenced there action.
Video games are easy answers to them, whether its the media (who I belief most don't care, only want ratings) or parents who want to know why.
They can't accept someone could become a mass murderer like a comic book villain."
28250,Don't forget about the Arma 3 arrestment in Greece
28251,how the fuck!!!???? does pokemon teach you wichcraft?!?!
28252,Bullshit
28253,"My Grand Father's Brother died on the USS California in Pearl Harbor and Michael bay made a shit romance movie about it and a lot of videos games contain the battle. My other Grand Father fought in D-day, Battle of the Bulge and Operation Plunder(across the Rhine) and lost alot of friends and I didn't get offend by it. There is bigger problems in this country for the government and news need to look at."
28254,"que standard watchmojo sad, epic tune (@ faluja)"
28255,"the thing with no russian is, it never tells you to kill anyone. It says follow makarov's lead nothing more nothing less."
28256,How about we don't sell shooting games to the mentally ill.
28257,The lady at the end is a hero.
28258,"Maybe that game Six Das in Fallujah could be considered a tribute to those six days. If the game conveyed the horror of the event, wouldn't that make us more aware of the violence and bloodshed going on in other countries. But yah, F@ck that people really died back then, so you game developers lose your freedom of expression. Shame on you for doing what call of duty and BF4 have been doing for years."
28259,"I just laugh when people talk about how games like GTA or Manhunt or those types of games in general are rotting children's minds...
To all of those people let me ask you...
WHO THE FUCK GOT THE GAME FOR HIM/HER IN THE FIRST PLACE?
As far as I know I don't see any 7 year old kid on a game store buying GTA, it's always the parent or a family member.
Now I'm aware that sometimes kids play those games even when those aren't theirs (for example the game is his brother's), especially when they aren't allowed."
28260,I know im supposed to feel bad for the pokemon but that guys skin coat looks badass
28261,News people need to calm the fuck down
28262,Why are all news media people allowed to walk outside without helmets? Or eat soup without floaties?
28263,"that whats mature stands for ,its not fo people who are not mature.THumbs up if u aggree"
28264,I love how Rockstar North are responsible for two on this list haha
28265,pokemon is the world of the devil! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!!!!! HAVE YOU SEEN HOW GODDAMN (no pun intended) CUTE THOSE LITTLE FUCKERS ARE???!!!!!!!!
28266,Mortal Kombat should be #1
28267,"What do you mean?
I live in Sydney and bought saints row 4 from the shop.
It has an R18+ rating"
28268,"Yeah man,people use real guns,not because they are easy to obtain,but because they see them in games.What?You haven't handcrafted an AK47 in your house?Or make a grenade thrower out of paper towels?"
28269,One of my favorites is people complaining that some games promote oversexualization of females. If they use it to sell the games then more power to them
28270,"While people can become more violent, video games and movies are not what make people commit mass murders. Did Hitler play video games? Did Vlad the Impaler play video games? Video games are about expanding reality, doing something that you can't do in real life. People can't seem to understand that for someone to shoot up a school, there has to be something deeply wrong with them. One thing can not possess someone into committing a mass murder. Don't even get me started on those nutcases that think Pokemon is Satanic, they are border line as ignorant as the WBC."
28271,"Yeah humanity is idiotic and run on emotions to think. Just think of it, if we were not so affected by emotions and there was actual logic in this world we could solve problems easier and there wouldn't be so much hate in this world"
28272,"If anything -- it's the news media that are largely to blame (or at least play a central part)foranynotable You see it everyday, they report on serial killers, mass shootings, crime and the killer(s) seem to get more press attention than the victims. That, coupled with a celebrity culture, people willgo to extremes -- such as mass murder --to get press attention. To get their15 minutes of fame...or so to speak."
28273,"Lol it's fucked up when watchmojo deems it ok to show the 'no Russian' clip but not the 'hot coffee' clip... Lol get your shit together man, just show both"
28274,Number one should be getting stuck in Bronze league in League of Legends.
28275,"to me it is a little ridiculous how violent games can be for the sake of ""entertainment"" but... it is also naive to pretend that people aren't already born with the ability to be violent or that people don't have violent fantasies and want outlets to express them. For every good virtue there is a bad one installed within us. I think to a certain extent it makes us desensitized to violence in general but not more likely to at out in violent way."
28276,I hate it when when news stations blame games. For example the Cod community is full of 7 year olds and the only thing learned to shoot was a water gun
28277,Fox news bunch of hacks always GOING on about games. All the time. One  major developer even  got on camera and said fox news is a joke that spreads false fears to people who want to believe them. Which hes right.
28278,remember when you point fingers there's always three more pointing back..lol
28279,"Because you know, Its not movies, books, the loose gun control, or even the man behind the gun, its video games. I freaking hate the news."
28280,Game at 3:29?
28281,they all piss me of...
28282,am i the only 1 here that thinks people blameing video games for violence are the actual people with mental problems?
28283,"I love how America tries to blame the mass killings on video games, when in reality it's because of their terrible firearm laws and how easy it is to get a gun..."
28284,"I'm Australian and I hate my countries game laws. Our government is so tight ass, it annoys the fuck out me."
28285,People never want to blame themselves so they blame someone else. My kids got into trouble. It can't be because I'm a bad parent. Better blame video games.
28286,Xenogears?
28287,People who blame video games are true dickheads!
28288,"That ""blame the game"" is so stupid. Because If someone plays a video game then shoots up a place and their parents blame the video game, I got news for you, that's called bad parenting."
28289,NO RUSSIAN BEST CLIP EVER
28290,"I would say the ever present: ""Videogames makes kids violent"" is something I would have put on the list."
28291,So my guess is the REAL problem are people from FOX News.
28292,Im pretty sure murders and shootings happened before videogames aswell.
28293,and thats why in the no Russian mission of call of duty i dident shoot anyone and al i did was give my team moral support
28294,"I have actually done a report on video game violence and how it effects the human mind. What I found is that violent video games desensitize the human mind a.k.a. it makes us feel more normal to these type of things. But, with that said, during my studies I found that the people who commit these awful shootings or crimes that are similar to the game, are people who have some sort of mental problem. These types of violent games should not be in the hands of mentally unstable people because it desensitizes them to the point that they feel it's okay to do. The same goes for people with extreme violent tendencies. So, yes these games can lead to extreme violent acts, but to certain people. I see no problem with these games but I do feel parents should not buy their kids these games and if they do they should be monitoring their kid's behavior. (If anything stated has offended anyone it was not intended. Thank you.)"
28295,That Pokemon was funny
28296,Fox now counts as a news station.
28297,"Every time a Amok run( Do you call it so or is it Massacre or so) is in Germany the News need something to blame it on like Video Games Mangas and Animes,  because there are no Menatlly ill Peplople or bullying no....only Video Games. The best thing was that they said Mangas and Animes are  Child Porn and we have to punish them. Yes..... don't fight the real Child Porn fight something to say: We did something and every Guy with a Manga is a pervert. :-I:-/"
28298,"Kinda bs all the people who do the murders and shit ""because of games"" already obviously have a mental issue. and anything could trigger that person to do crazy stuff imo.."
28299,I never thought about it. Some games are pretty bad.
28300,"Dont u know people? Whenever someone is firing a gun in a shooting, they're actually operating a mouse or the R2 button. Video Games shall be burned!!!!
Seriously though whenever i see those news on, i just think to myself ""I like FPS games... Am i gonna be a maniac who massacres people with firearms?"" I burst into laughter when i hear that shit on the news. My friends play CoD BO II Zombie mode online. And to my knowledge, they havnen't been part of a mass shooting"
28301,Top 10 Fox News FAILS
28302,The reason i do not like or watch the news: Its all biased Bullshit except for the weather.
28303,"do top 10 music controversies, i want to see james vance vs judas priest"
28304,#NAME?
28305,"You know, I'm sick of people who blame videogames for all violence. Videogames MAY NOT be the source! There's likely just a lot of idiots in the world. It's not like someone would just play a shooter and think: Oh wow! Killing soldiers and people looks fun! I'm gonna go try it! Or if someone is playing Grand Theft Auto and thinks: Oh, pulling off heists and stealing cars looks so fun! I'm gonna try it in real life! Besides, videogames inspire people to do what they always wanted to do, not killing people, but good things like playing sports like: Tennis, Baseball, Bowling, that kind of thing. And also physical activities like: Parkour, skateboarding, etc. People should really leave videogames the FUCK alone when it comes to violence in real life. Videogames don't kill people, it's the Idiots and Psychopaths in the world that do."
28306,"I remember the Pokemon controversy. My dad got rid of all my pokemon posters and cards after he learned about Jynx. Then 7 years later we moved to Des Moines , Iowa where the craziest of black churches pretty much bashed the game before of that pastor they saw on TV."
28307,"CoD: Modern Warfare 3, Mission: Big Ben. Even that mission shocked me!"
28308,"Careless parents are to be blamed. Letting their kids play violent games without knowing it and blaming video games when their kids get stupid. The parents should blame themselves for being careless. ESRB was created to avoid these shit yet the parents are the ones not giving a fuck about it.
I fucking hate kids at online play so please..."
28309,"the goverment is s2pid if you ban video games people will just go ahead and pirate them , they are not stoping anyone but the game industry"
28310,Freaking conservatives
28311,How ironic...This video showed a video game decapitating and impaling video game characters but yet they still censored out the video game nudity. Jesus Christ--there's no common sense in the world
28312,"I am pretty sure Night Trap in it's original format, and I don't know if this made it in to the game, have a scene with girl getting killed by a guy with a massive drill drilling slowly in to her skull.... there was if I recall, actually a great many scenes in Night Trap's Beta at least which would have made it worth of your most violent vg list."
28313,Bully
28314,Really? Pokemon? Only creationist would dislike that game.
28315,six days in fallujah shoulda came out.
28316,Doom caused Colombine? Or would that be classified under one of th entries?
28317,"No wonder why games nowadays are becoming shittier and shittier year after year. Where is DOOM, Mortal Combat and of course Carmagedon? (and many more)"
28318,Another thing wrong about the Mass effect controversy was you can play as a female and treat the males as sex objects.
28319,If Hillary Clinton becomes president we gamers must unite against the government
28320,"Conservative media hypocrisy:
""Guns don't kill people, people kill people."" Fair enough.
""Video games don't kill people, oh wait yes video games kill people."" ..."
28321,"Wait a minute, Pokemon practices witchcraft?? Da fuq?? I don't remember casting spells in any of the games."
28322,lol the only new station that kept on reappearing was FOX News lol
28323,TV in general is a big problem and leads people to be more and more agressive...
28324,Screw those controversies. Most of those games are good and make alot of money especially Pokemon they make money from the merchandises to their own stores.
28325,you know the said the same shit when movies were getting more violent and they will say the same thing in the next new form of entertainment
28326,Everyone in the Fox News clips were complete idiots.
28327,Fucking Fox News. I really don't understand why they can't just stick to hating democrats and go on with their lives.
28328,"If I couldn't do what video games allow me to do, I will probably be on death row right now."
28329,You should rephrase the title as it does not explain properly whats in the video- also i am not complaining
28330,more like Top 10 Butthurts
28331,Jack Thompson.
28332,"Man , America got to understand real life and fantasy , if they spend That time stopping criminals instead of rating videogames"
28333,"Some people don't know shit about the way people act. It's not the games that make people kill, it's the people themselves being unstable psychopaths at birth."
28334,Fuck Fox
28335,we need that women at the end representing the gamers
28336,MANHUNT WAS ON WII?!
28337,WTF!!!! POKEMON DOESN'T ENCOURAGE WITCHCRAFT!!!!!
28338,fuck people who think video games cause violence its stuped it take's more then fucking video games to make a killer or a terrorist!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
28339,"People are ignorant, we can't change that. We just need to educate them, the sooner we can do that the better we can get along."
28340,Would the pokemon Lavender town suicides count?
28341,Funny how PETA is accusing Pokemon and the Pokemon Company for promoting animal abuse yet PETA themselves are the ones who kill over 60% of the animals in their care
28342,"oh my god! video games do the exact opposite of what these idiots are saying. video games help people contain their murder urge by letting them release their anger on AI and not actual people! These idiot news reporters just want something to blame that they don't like, and what would that be? I think you can figure that out."
28343,Rockstar Games are just awesome!!
28344,U have to admit no Russian was fun
28345,"The six days in falujah story is completely inappropriate saying that because your children lost their lives is completely out of the question when only 200 combatants were killed but when you look at video games that represent world war 2 where more than 25 million lost their children in the most devastating conflict known to man and that seems to have no need of banning you dont see world war 2 veterans complaining nor do you see your official veterans of falujah complaining but rather getting involved to tell a story of their experiences? All because a game gives you the opportunity to restart and continue playing doesnt mean its controversial more than billions across the globe have lost family to devastating events and that includes terrorism, warfare and murder but you dont see them taking such games to court but 200 families complaining about their losses in falujah? Atomic games wanted to portray an accurate description of the battle of falujah so people can understand the heart ship and the terrible events of that day these companies do not just make games for entertainment but to also tell a story to commemorate those brave men in conflict and the people that dont see it that way when gaming dont truly see the whole point of video games not only are they a form of entertainment but a form of art and story telling a form of experience to test your morality in certain situations and how you would feel to be I certain peoples positions- my name is daniel irving and I am experienced gamer and I am currently studying in law and marketing"
28346,I was expecting storyline controversies
28347,Some peoples ignorance towards this subject just piss me off. I play games most are violent and you don't see me murdering a bunch of people. I love how America (not all Americans) thinks they need guns to protect themselves yet they use violent video games as a scapegoat for murder.
28348,Shocking Peta Flash Games? Nnnoooope!
28349,The retardation of conservatives never fails to amuse me
28350,Fuck that fat bitch. Fuck her dead kid and all the other people whos children died in Fallujah. Never should have been there in the first place.
28351,Fox news your voice for evil news at 11.
28352,"Why does everything revolve around video games? Thwy are supposted to be a way to vent out anger,stress,etc. But the news say its a way TO LINK KILLING?? I am now done with the news and all the people who ""supposedly"" made a study on people on violent video games"
28353,"I knew there were morons out there who thought everything regarding ""witchcraft"" was evil and children reading Harry Potter were on their way to hell. But that Pokemon teaches children how to actually use witchcraft ... I ... I mean ... do they .......... WHAT THE BLOODY MOTHERFUCKING HELL DO THESE PEOPLE USE INSTEAD OF A BRAIN?!"
28354,"So wait, Doom supposedly being connected with Columbine is an honorable mention, despite the fact that it's really the main reason controversy over video games is still allowed to continue, or got to the point that it is. That makes no sense at all. That should at least be number 2."
28355,"and you know what, it pisses me off that its mostly the video games at fault. like video games are the ONLY thing in this world that involve shooting, violence, and blood. how pathetic most of these media people are."
28356,"Fuck age ratings, they are pathetic and discriminatory against young people, 99% of which can easily handle violence and not be influenced just as well as over 18s. Also, fuck all of these imbeciles who think video games cause real-world violence by anyone other than psychopaths who were violent to begin with!"
28357,im pissed that every time a mass shooting come along they go and blame it on the video game companies. It seems like every CoD has been in every mass shooting topic -.-
28358,our games will always get the blame for any killing now days but i thank it is just retarded
28359,wow really all stories for games piss me off mojo all
28360,"I thought mass effect 1 was done really well. It was tasteful in comparison to other games on this list. Funny how don't hear too much about that game. Also, ratings are on games for a reason. I feel sorry for Australian gamers for their government trying to nanny them. But then again, there is always steam."
28361,"I really just don't understand why people seem to believe that killing in a game equates to wanting to be a murderer. The only thing that has changed is how people play. I mean really, no matter how realistic video games may appear to be, there is no proven link between playing violent games and killing people. I don't even know where the idea that there was some kinda link between violent games and killing people came from."
28362,"""When did videogames become so violent and scary?!!?""
---Wreck-It Ralph"
28363,"In 'no Russian ', I just walk & let them do the killing, till the authorities came..."
28364,god i fucking hate games getting blamed for shootings and terrorist attacks
28365,Why all the Fox News clips?
28366,Love how these people are using video games as scapegoats to real problems they refuse to address.
28367,i think whenever they blame video games for mass shootings: they all ate pizza..... so do we need to get rid of pizza?
28368,what about top 10 ac/dc songs?
28369,Resi 5. Killing black people controversy.
28370,"The ""video games are to blame"" argument is, in my opinion, utter bollocks."
28371,What about the Arma 3 imprisonment?
28372,fuck fox news
28373,"The woman at the end is a hero. People are being blinded from the real issues such as mental health issues and gun availability. There are no age rating systems for books, meaning anyone can read American Psycho or Dexter which have a ton of violence sex and drugs."
28374,I hate the press :/ they always say video games are the cause ok so if something like someone keeps jumping on peoples heads then your gonna blame Mario right? no your gonna blame mw2 ok well i dont see me jumping on heads there unless if you mean the other way :3
28375,"Please dont blame videogames for the violence , the fact is.. in USA its Soooo Easy get a weapon. If usa dont take  control of the distriburion of guns ,things Like This will keep happen."
28376,That woman at the end of the six days one was like many people died well that's in every fucking war there games in ww2 and they don't talk about that the game could have been amazing but the press thought ohh it's a real war people can't play this when every fucking ww2 game is a real war u no why because it's ww2.

28378,Australia sucks
28379,hmmm.....anything that involved that prick Jack Thompson
28380,Kim!  : ) but too much fox news : (
28381,"as a soft core gamer, i find rather irritating when such ignorant individuals find it fitting to blame video games for things such as shootings"
28382,"So many full retards in the media, they should really consider taking a course on critical thinking. Maybe they would be less fallacious."
28383,"at 2:50 any one else hear him say ""grand theft Controversie leaving out the auto part lol'"
28384,State of emergency!
28385,#1 is my top thing
28386,"Really? The whole video i just watched, it's about blaming video games for shootings. But in gun control, they let people carry their weapons so some of them will shoot every innocent people. It's fucking annoying that the government are ignorant, they do not notice it's because of the gun control."
28387,How about Resident Evil 5 ?
28388,Why I always hear fapping in your intros.
28389,so that's why Ross came to the United States
28390,"On "" No Russian "" In MW2 There was a warning given before the level started so yeah dont blame the game blame the player if there is controversy"
28391,"2 things about the MW2 one:
1: The game doesn't make people violent, it's about the person
2: Yes, you kill innocent people but you kill a lot of other men. But that's okay because they're soldiers and enemies of the USA where the controversy comes from?"
28392,"An ESRB is meant to stop certain games given to kids who are not psychologically developed to play certain violent/sexual games. I do believe it is the parents fault for letting their children play certain games under the rating the game was given. However, these are controversies, that I believe are accurate. These games that have been in this video should be controlled and honest truth, the news reporters and the media were right..."
28393,hahahahahahhahaha how can they blame games for people going out and shooting people when they let anyone own a gun americans are a bunch of fuckwits if they are just going to keep denying that its they fault they're friends and family get shot and killed all the time
28394,if GTA makes people kill other people Why do i not have a Charmander by my side or in my pocket to walk around with and battle other people?
28395,3:35and yet theygave GTA V a free pass WTF
28396,"Stupid people, stupid people everywhere."
28397,"bullsh*t, the ""terrorist shooting because of video game"" is a problem that should have been long gone!"
28398,You actually are never told to shoot any of the civilians in MW2
28399,Do top ten frustrating games
28400,You missed ethnic cleansing for honorable mentions.
28401,"Idk why killing and blood is interesting in video games, in other words we are creating mental psychopaths with video games like call of duty, just so stupid"
28402,Video games definitely cause people to go out and act on what they've been doing in game. Like just a few weeks ago me and 24 strangers killed a triceratops.
28403,I was surprised that you did not mention the imprisonment of 2 ARMA III developers.
28404,"Medias are, for the biggest ones, around half about lying or ""half"" lying by using specific viewpoints, persons and ways of talk to simulate truth in fronf of thousands or millions of people who are not aware of this. I think they are one of biggest human's threats, with wars and money."
28405,Anyone else notice all of the fox news?
28406,GTA V was blamed for the Navy Yard Shooting....The game was far from release smh
28407,The creators of the game should not take the blame for people going on a killing spree..... its the fucking fault of the parents letting their retarted children play it. Stupid shits
28408,The first thing I always did was enter the blood code in Mortal Kombat Genesis. Start game and enjoy.
28409,"5:29 and more people loves their lives in WW1, 2, Vietnam, and countless other wars that videogames have already replicated. Fuck off, you can't pick and choose when to be against historical events being replicated through a medium."

28411,"Number One is the best...hahahahaha...btw...doesnt this mean that all the People in the Army (no matter what country in the world) play a lot of so called Killer Games when they arent somewhere on a Battlefield!?...then this means....Oh sh.t, WERE DOOMED! :)"

28417,Why is it that pretty much all of the news outlets on here is on Fox News?
28418,"I like ""No Russian"""

28420,The sex minigame shows how much society has changed in a short time frame. Now GTA5 can show straight up sex and only the torture scene raises heads.

28425,MW2 still is being blamed for terrorism and massacres
28426,Classic America bitching about everything
28427,All these old folks think they know squat about video games.
28428,not this again... the video game world got pass thisclose minded crap. i can name tenths of movies that creeps the hell out of me... some thing like saw or other manslaughter gory ones. Sex and violence have been in the media in like forever.
28429,"Let's be honest though ""No Russian"" was fun"
28430,"Saying that video games cause violence is like saying that guns kill people. Guns don't kill people, people with guns kill people"
28431,What about the whole bully controversy?
28432,"In my opinion, violent video games are not meant to encourage our darker thoughts, but to channel them instead. If i'm feeling extremely angry, punching someone in the face in a game would be a lot better than going out and doing it in real life."

28439,"Fuck the news for reporting horse shit and scaring dumb people, fuck dumb people for believing the news and forcing people to censor their art, and fuck JACK THOMPSON! GET DISBARRED BITCH!"
28440,oh media.. they love taking shit our of proportion and out of context.. I love how todays society like to blame games for their shitty parent skills
28441,Fuck Fox News!
28442,people who usually do mass shootings have a lack of empathy. u cant lose ur empathy by playing violent video games. .
28443,I have played at least three of the games in the video in the past 5 hours.
28444,"Manhunt 2 uncensored no longer available on PC?
http://www.gamersgate.com/DD-MANHUNT2/manhunt-2
hmm...what's this then?"
28445,I remember when  was a kid  was a news story about a kid who hanged his brother to imitate a level of mortal kombat. My mom blamed the game and i blamed the parent. The kid was like 10
28446,stupid media get ur head out of ur asses these are fictional all of the shootings omg it is just a copout video games made me do this
28447,"Talking sense to the media about videogame violence is absolutely pointless. They know what they say is bogus, but they still say it because it starts controversies and controversies bring in the almighty dollar in huge amounts."
28448,"y manhunt 2
manhunt was way worse"
28449,video games should be banned. and while their at it take our guns and our freedom away too.
28450,FU*K Fox News
28451,"people are studied it's just a video game not real, and if parents get all up set seeing there kids playing a game where there shooting people it's there fault because they bought it for them"
28452,"Ok firstly games have an age restriction for a reason like GTA for example its 18+ so if say a 13 year old plays it its not the game developers fault its the parent/guardian's fault as they bought it for the child secondly if someone who plays any FPS and then commits a crime (which is highly unlikely) that's because they can't separate reality from fiction and in that case shouldn't be allowed play any game at all and its like saying Minecraft promotes cruelty to animals because you need to kill them for food or Fallout promotes nuclear war because of its post-apocalyptic setting, These are all just attempts at taking down be companys because they make money. End of!!"
28453,... ignorant stupid hater people.... you can't blame those things on a game.... ignorance!! ignorance and mass media.. -.-
28454,"news about games is always one sided,news channels or bloggers just want a subject to criticize on first it was the television now it's the video games, people who are involved in shootings or mass killing have mental disorders or suffered brutal bullying in many cases. virtual shooting and real shooting are way different
we shoot from controller trigger not real triggers and games are not satanic they are for entertainment just like movies and are emotional we learn things from them"
28455,They are are blaming 1st person shooters because our society is going to hell
28456,"They should have talked about the Anders Behring Breivik incident on Utya, Norwegian stores had to stop selling violent games for a period after it..."
28457,The airport massacre scene on MW2
28458,People blame video games because they are so big this is what happened when the film industry became huge in early 1900's they got blamed for any thing that went wrong in the world...even books have been blamed for horrible crimes. They don't seem to understand for a video game its the gamer not the game.
28459,I'm surprised Rockstar's game Bully wasn't on this list. That game got so much unwarranted negative press that it was almost banned from store shelves before it was even released.
28460,Oh... I givethanks to video games because without itI might've hurt someone in RL
28461,"When video games dies, what will the media and congress talk smack about next"
28462,I fucking hate it when the news blames video games for shootings when it's been proven that there is no link. If the news show hosts sat down and played call of duty or battlefield for X amount of time would they want to murder? Of course fucking not so why are the blaming games?
28463,"These retarded controversies are as dumb and pointless as a man trying to fill up their car by putting the gas nozzle into the exhaust pipe.... and this is coming from a Russian that fully enjoys violent gory games and is very kind to people in real life, I saw the airport mission in MW2 and I honestly don't give a shit about it, it's a game, people enjoy games, and the plot behind the mission is quite cool too! 
The conclusion of this comment is....
I'm getting really sick and tired of constantly saying ""it's just a game"" to non - gamers"

28468,God I hate the media. They just see something then immediately jump to their soapboxes without studying the topic they try to generalize all of us gamers and put us in the with the 000000000.1% that have mental illness and play the game then go shoot up a school. I've played violent games since I was in diapers and I'm not really violent at all. I just play games to relieve some stress and enjoy myself. And I know plenty of u do too.

28480,"Looking back at MW2 I can't believe they did that, it might be the one occasion that I feel they stretched a little bit too much, but even so I'm against any censorship of any art form, there is an age rating system for a reason, the regulatory institutions just need to respect it like they do with movies industry."
28481,"Ive been playing videos games since i was a wee lad, ive never had the urge to use then kill hookers, commit a massacre in an airport or shoot up a school.

If you're going to try to shield your child from everything that has an orphan being mocked simply for being an orphan, then I advise you NOT to buy American McGee's Alice for her.

28504,I hate anyone that says Video Games make people violent. People that have committed crimes and played violent games normally have mental disabilities.

28506,"Talk about the pot calling the kettle black on #1. The news is, in my opinion, the biggest cause of mass shootings. That's because most news stations tend to glorify the killer."

28517,maybe the school shooting was form bullying but ni it video game because it easy to blame them and not the bully
28518,"Most people who play violent video games are normal law abiding citizens as are most people who legally own guns. We cannot point to a game as the sole reason for someone going to school/work/wherever and killing people b/c that would imply that these games should and do have this effect on everyone and that is clearly not the case. Does owning a gun make it easier to go and possibly shoot someone...sure but only in the way that you have to have a gun physically in your hands to be able to shoot someone in the first place, but simply owning one does not make you violent and neither does playing hours of violent games a week. I mean how do we then explain all the other cases of gun related violence that didn't involve these two things? Some people are just literally crazy, and no amount of hugs, church, or ""the right"" parents or neighborhood can prevent these individuals from doing what they are going to do or did."
28519,"The controversy I hate the most is the ""children's exposure to violence"" issue that is always popping up on talkshows and anywhere else, every time a new violent game is released. GTA V for example was discussed on talk shows, with hosts berating it because children shouldn't be allowed to play them.
The fact that these games are rated 18 makes no difference to these people, the best argument being that the parents buy the games for their kids. It's bad parenting, not bad games, but none of the parents that watch those daytime chat shows want to hear that they're being bad parents!"

28529,Is that actually Kim Jong? Probably not
28530,Gamers denying the links between violent games and violent behavior are just like conservatives denying links between greenhouse gases and chaotic weather.

28533,"Video games are to blame for killings- stupid media.  Its not videogames, it's the people who are mentally unstable. Sure I love slamming a raider's head with a sledgehammer in Fallout but that doesn't mean I'm going to do this in real life. Just as bad as blaming any form of music"
28534,"Hey America I got a fucking genius idea. Instead of blaming video games for their ""effects"" on kids, why not ban guns? No?"
28535,i played Worms Armageddon and i think im gonna go on a killing spree.
28536,"What happens when people don't know how to tell what's real or not !! Shooting games isn't the damn problem, it's the retarded people who think its fun killing people."
28537,"I play video games a lot, I spend about eight hours of my day playing video games, yet I still view school shootings as tragic, same goes for any other loss of life, no matter who lost it. I like guns too. It's just I don't think everyday, 'Gee, I wonder how many 1st Grades I can kill with this Saiga!' or, 'Gee, how many banks can I rob with this GSG 522!'
You know, playing video games for extended periods of time DOESN'T kill your morale compass. Do you think Nero had Man hunt? Do you think that Vlad The Impaler had GTA? Do you think that the SS had MW2? I think not.
Some humans are inherently violent, video games change nothing.
Lastly, it's mostly people with mental issues who go on these mass shootings who (somehow) manage to get their hands on a firearm. Why? I dunno, they mostly blast their brains to oblivion when the cops or some random CCW guy shows up.
Terrorists like the Taliban still shoot at US Army soldiers because they have a cause (although I don't agree with it), but put all the crazy guys who shot up schools in the same situation, they'd probably kill themselves before the US Army boys even put a round in the chamber."

28543,"yeah blame it on the video games,music and movie
and when all that shit with the school shooting and all the rest of thing like that happens weare are the perents"
28544,I really hate it when the media blames video games on the problems in the world. when are no where near the issues they bring up.
28545,I don't understand what is so special about the torture scene in GTA V.

28547,"I hate the video games cause mass shootings controversy most because it so false. Ireason being, on xbox I play many fps games (first person shooter) like borderlands 2, C.O.D, and battlefield and so do my many friands on xbox, but never once have I thought,"" hey id like to go and kill lots of real people"". no ive never done that. its just stupid."

28552,"People these days want a quick fix. They don't want to really do the work to understand what would cause someone to develop a mental illness that would make them want to shoot innocent people. They would rather ban something like guns or videos games because its easy. After banning some ""evil"" inanimate object they will sleep better at night THINKING they somehow fixed the problem until another tragedy happens, then they will blame some other thing and want to ban it. Its just a never ending cycle."
28553,"Man, I bet they played video games non-stop during the Crusades and Spanish Inquisition. I mean, what else influenced those two events of mass genocide from happening?"
28554,"the one that pisses me off the most is that every time there is a massive tragedy like the shootings, everyone in the press instantly jumps on the video games cause violence bandwagon...
its not just shooter games either. the guy from i think it was sweden that did a mass shooting played WoW..
just because we play games where we kill thousands upon thousands of pixels, doesnt mean we are 1 step away from shooting up a school...
there is always something else that helps trigger it
mental illness, depression, attention seeking...all kinds of things that can and should be taken care of before they get that far!
and you know what? that rating system is there for a reason...dont buy your 12 year old a M rated game! i wouldnt get my 12 yr old even most T rated games..
what it comes down to is parental responsibility and actually interacting with your kids!
shocker i know, but yes i do mean you need to be parents!
stop blaming everything on what we gamers do to relax.
look at the numbers..how many thousands of hours of CoD are played DAILY, and how many mass shootings do we have? if they truly caused violence, we would have them every fricken day...we dont though because when played by someone with the mental cpacity and health to handle what is shown in game, they are harmless. hell if anyhting, LoL players should be the ones doing the majority of mass shootings if you base it purely off emotion induced from the game!"
28555,"What annoys me is that the Governments/Powers That Be can orchestrate a war when they see fit, send their country's men and women to shoot at one another and die for their own greedy wealth driven political agendas, but then frown on art imitating life so to speak. This is why people commit suicide, sometimes this whole life thing feels like a really big joke that only 2-3% of the world's population find humorous. And it's humorous to them because they can afford for it to be. I can't. Let me play F#$%ING video games damnit."

28581,"Every time I hear complaints about games while parents ignore the sex, violence or insanity on their television every night all I hear is ""We gotta put those action movies on to distract our child so we don't have to rise them ourselves but we MUST stop those vijagames from presenting them with violent imagery and that evil sex. They should learn it good and proper.. from Jean Claude Vandam.""."
28582,"Is Fox News filled with old conservative retards? I don't watch them, but that's what it seems."

28587,WatchMojo I live in Australia and after a while they allowed state of decay and Saints Row 4. they had two change something first though. Instead of drugs in state of decay they changed it to something else and in Saints Row 4 we have one less missions then you guys do but we get codes which we can redeem when we buy the game. Like so they can see.
28588,"Parents blaming video games for violence is like blaming McDonalds
for obesity. It's not their fault, it's the parent's, since they are the ones who allowed their children to use it in the first place.
One example is GTA. Even though it was 18+, parents still let their kids to play it- AND YET THEY STILL BLAME THE COMPANY FOR IT'S MATURE CONTENT!!! WHY!!!"
28589,Fox news is a joke. Just a bunch of assclowns

28612,Gosh I hate dumb media.
28613,"People blaming Video Games for the real-life cases of violence is, quite honestly, a ignorant judgement on the industry and on the human condition.
It is true that Video Games can influence people. Every form of media and social interaction is, by definition, an influence that can cause people to change or behave differently. But when somebody does an act of philanthropy or general kindness, do we point accusingly at them and say ""This is an outrage! This is the result of X that you've watched/played/read/drawn last week!"" Of course not.
Sometimes, people just do bad things because they inherently have issues or difficulties that they need to work through"

28615,So....someone tell me what video games they played when civilization first started? Violence doesn't come from video games. People make me want to throw up.

28617,Top 10 Nirvana Songs
28618,didn't resident evil 5 get controversy too ? I don't remember why but it was kind of a big deal wasn't it ?
28619,People blame games but movies are worse for gore and realism it's a form of entertainment not a simulation but the press have got to talk about something so they blame games because they haven't ever played them but they will watch movies with scenes worse than what's in a video game will ever have.
28620,I think there should be a Jack Thompson video game in which you brutally murder clones of Jack Thompson
28621,"Guns in video games don't kill people, real guns kill people. How can they talk about tightening the distribution of games and not guns the tools of killing."
28622,Should've pointed out that Sr4 was unbanned in Australia straight away. I got it release date.
28623,"not exactly a gaming controversy but the late 90's kids started robbing newsagents in the uk for pokemon cards, there was actually break ins and even beatings for them"
28624,People are so stupid they act like games cause people to do stupid s*** when watching movies can do the same thing
28625,mortal kombat is the first video game i ever played when i was 4 and i've bought almost every main entry in the series. it makes feel good that the first game i ever played is one of the most violent games of all time.
28626,"If these people are gonna pull statistics out of their ass for how many mass murderers that are gamers, then why not show how many that aren't? Why not show how many gamers that doesn't commit violent acts? Oh, right... That doesn't sell any newspapers, now does it?"
28627,Only agree with #4
28628,Oh shit. Ed Boon is Syler.
28629,"I don't understand these controversies about video games. Ok, I have played shooters, BF3, Modern Warfare 1, 2 and 3, Duke Nukem, Bioshock, etc. I have played violent games with tons of gore and blood, one of them being L4D. Claiming that a psychopath murdered dozens of people because of a video game is bullshit, what's the difference between him and me, then? Like that lady said at the end of the video, there are many factors for what happened (mental illness, for example). And sure, things may get dirty with video games, like pornographic scenes, but that's understandable, now murders because of video games is the stupidest excuse I've heard. These were made for entertainment and contain warnings and age recommendations. Just to finish I agree with this list, and the shit I've pointed out pisses me off... I'm a gamer, lock me up."
28630,Also you can be a woman in mass effect
28631,People these days can fuckin stupid these days
28632,That PETA flash game looked stupidly scary

28638,"Did Hitler play videogames? Did Jack the Ripper play videogames?
NO! Don't blame videogames for people's mental problems"
28639,lol at number 4...what about every world war 2 game ever released?
28640,"Besides #2 all of these are ridiculous. To take some one's life in real life is just like..wow. But in a game it's like who cares. If we get rid of tv, movies, games it might actually show what I suspect. I suspect violent behavior comes from upbringing and parents need to do a better job and that the games are just enough to push some one over the edge but they don't cause the whole thing."
28641,the U.S media is fucking retarded
28642,"The news media is just on a stupid witch hunt to sensor video games! This is one of the many reasons why their dieing. Nobody is watching the news networks any more because their so out of touch with most people. Why dont the media get upset when there's long ass sex scenes in movies, and super realistic violence and people dieing in movies!!??? There's even movies depicting real battles that happened in Afghanistan and Iraq, and movies depicting realistic terrorist attacks where civilians die!! But that's all okay as long as it's in a Hollywood movie to,the media! But god help a video game if it tries to have any adult content or realistic violence! It's gonna get dragged true the mud by every moron on fox, cnn, msnbc!!"
28643,"#1 pissed me off. Because everybody blames video games when really, you got to look at mental illness. Video games don't kill people. People kill people"
28644,"Of course FOX news is spearheading the anti video game crusade, they always have. Nice list though, glad to see MK on here. Besides, that game was the whole reason the ESRB was created. Truly a history changing game."
28645,"Lets me honest FOX knows nothing and don't do enough research about what they are talking about this being one of them as I saw most of the persecution were of mostly fox clips. But some of the things I can strongly agree, cod will always be a shit game with shit campaigns."
28646,"Fox News, what a joke!!!"
28647,Just started watching this but I'm pretty sure cod mw2s airport controversy is going to be in here let's see if I'm right
28648,They blame video games then let kids play paint ball and/or lazer tag in real life which I would consider much more realistic than cod or gta.
28649,"surgery games doesn't make you a surgery doctor.
racing games doesn't make you an expert race driver.
so shooter games doesn't make you a killer"
28650,Hmm this kid liked Call of duty/battlefield/halo etc. that means he is a insane killer deep down in his mind we have to ban every game that has a gun even Lego Star Wars because 12 year olds are going to shoot the prime minister of Iceland! -makes sense -_-
28651,Fuck the press!!!! lol
28652,The most realistic sex acts ever conceived.  I laughed so hard. WTSF?

28664,of course Fox would talk about it. Fuckin idiots
28665,POKEMON WORLD IS A WORLD OF THE DEMONIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
28666,Surely its better to play a game where you see virtual people being killed than to watch a story of a school massacre on the news
28667,"Video games shouldn't be blamed for violence, the people who committed the act of violence should. OR if the player is too young or has a disability the PARENTS should be blamed for letting them play the game. JESUS, VIDEO GAMES ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE YOU F***ING IDIOTS."

28674,I don't get how MK is part of this because who can rip out peoples ribs and hearts in real life except Chuck Norris.
28675,"People offer video games to their kids all the time, and yet they don't take the time to sit with their children and understand what they are all about : having FUN.
When people don't know shit about something and yet spend a lot of money into it, it instantly becomes a crispy subject for medias... and people get brainwashed."
28676,Fox News sucks.
28677,"WE might as well censor violent movies and t.v. While were on that why not history too, since people have been massacred in gory medieval battles, little kiddies might get the wrong idea."
28678,"This is a bunch of crap! Let me tell you this; They say ""Oh, they performed the mass killings because they used a virtual gun in a virtual world where they are not real people!"" Hold on! They're blaming VIDEO GAMES but they are skimming over Slasher Films/Torture Films? That's weird, considering that the films are REAL PEOPLE getting killed yes I know they're actors but but please know what I mean I have no issue with Horrors it's just that they're blaming games over this, it boggles my mind!"
28679,It's a shame the government blames video games and not themselves for all these violence
28680,My God Fox news has no shame. They'll just prostitute periodism and stain the reputation of an industry just to get some ratings.
28681,"The guys at the news are retarded when there is talk about video game. There are allweys that one guy, that says: Games are bad for kids."
28682,Video games can't always be blame for violence or immorality.

28686,"call me crazy, but i think the best scene in MW2 was the no russian scene because it effected you. It showed you horrific scenes and didnt pull any punches. It was the last time that a video game, in recent memory, that showed the depth of human cruelty in a very realistic way. Hell, it was art, and the last time the cod franchise surprised me due to its maturity."
28687,#angryjoe
28688,"Controversies about video games leaving people with mental or emotional scars are simply a load of bullshit. They have no foundation at all.
What people do most often when something tragic happens, they look for somewhere to cast blame while the people who lost something mourn. Usually, in the case of shootings or similar incidents involving firearms, the blame is cast in one of two places. If it was an adult, it's the fact that they had a gun, and that all guns should be banned or taken out of homes. If it was someone who is not considered an adult, then it's all about how video games ruined their minds and drove them mad. What if... stay with me here, what if it was the fault of the person? Or the people they interacted with? Or their normal mental condition? Or the lack of attention from others? I know, it's weird, right? God forbid people find something in THEMSELVES that caused the issue rather than casting the blame onto something else that clearly isn't the problem.
The problem is this. People don't want to ever find themselves accountable for anything that they can blame on something else. It's just natural, or at least it's become that way. It shouldn't be, but it is. Think about what YOU are doing, and let people play their god damned video games if they want to."
28689,"What the fuck?
5:28"
28690,"blaming the video games, instead of the parents"
28691,"Blaming video games for mass shootings and/or violence is just ridiculous. Sure, games are violent sometimes. But that doesn't mean they brain wash people into killing."
28692,Six Days in Fallujah would have been amazing.
28693,"Hey guys, guys, the shooter goes uses the bathroom a couple times per day, that must mean going to the bathroom causes you to have violent outbursts!"
28694,"pokemon is a game that teaches children how to enter into the world of witchcraft, how to cast spells ... That dude was kidding, right? I mean, i can understand where the PETA thing comes from, but no sane person would come to the demonic conclusion with pokemon, right! right? ..."
28695,"The thing that bothers me the most is the fucking retarded parents who buy 18 rated games or R rated games as it is in america (I think) and then whine and moan about how violent they are, here is the big hint, they get these ratings for a reason, but then bad parents do try to blame others for their own problems."
28696,Conservative ideals are bullshit.
28697,Didn't expect Kim from the Yogscast to be in this video.
28698,And where did 99% of the controversy take place? In the US
28699,"FOR GOD'S SAKE, It's not because of video games Its because the fucking parents cant raise children anymore and teach whats wrong and whats right"
28700,"Obviously there was no such thing as violence or killing or shooters before video games were a thing. Before video games, everyone was happy and peaceful and not a single person on this planet ever picked up a gun and killed someone. No, because of a video game with a lot of 2d blood and killing, that is the reason anyone in this world is a killer. How fucking believable is that."
28701,blaming games for school shootings it's the bullying and teachers who don't do nothing
28702,Fox News is always the ones who are whining
28703,"The first one is basically that noooo real war is totally not inspiring it's gaaamees
Idiotic"
28704,Conservatives can suck my dick
28705,I saw Kim from The Yogscast.
28706,How come we don't hear from that asshole from Florida?
28707,yay kim
28708,fox iz dumb
28709,Hoe about Wolfenstein 3D
28710,to be honest its not completely the newspapers fault its the idiots that still believe everything they read
28711,Just an excuse for the NSA to spy on gamers and criminalize us...that's all I got out of this
28712,"So many Americans in this,  jeez"
28713,"dont ever watch foxnews, it kills braincells"
28714,I play fifa I'm fine
28715,i would have said the game that lets you reanact kennydys death
28716,"I would play an m rated game, but not try to kill AUCTUALL people after it!!!"
28717,"Video games don't kill people, People kill people"
28718,UGH MY HEAD the stupidity is too damn high! these reporters really don't have nothing better to do?
28719,I'm surprised Mortal Kombat was only #7.
28720,Fox News lies all the time
28721,Most of these controversies are just idiotic and oversensitive.
28722,ok you kill innocent's but look at the men in the army some are corrupted like they kill innocent's and they steal money and become the next new story and we are letting are kids see this it could hurt them bad
28723,"It's not video games, movies or music that needs to be blamed on, its the irresponsible parents because they don't watch their kids are doing which leads to these horrific events they need to stop blaming on the media instead they need blame themselves for not taking their children right."
28724,"No one gives a shit about porn 
But if videogames show a Semi
Nude Person it's controversial :-/"
28725,"The Pokemon situation reminds me of my mother. I'm not religious, and a year back, she said I couldn't get a gag horse mask. She now told me that they're worn at Satanic rituals, which is completely false. Stupid people, stupid choices."
28726,It's been a long time since watchmojo has  auctualy posted a good vid none of those crappy top. Ten songs bullshit great vid wm
28727,"Strange, there's a hell of a lot of FOX News in this video. Odd that."
28728,I knew no russian would be on here
28729,"Super Columbine RPG, nuff said"
28730,"These games are based on violence, violence isnt based on games"
28731,"Its so stupid to blame games for all the violence. i play CoD, Battlefield and GTA, and i'm not out there killing people and stealing cars."
28732,Parents just like to blame anything they can other than themselves for how violent there kids turn out. 30 years ago kids were turned violent by tv and before that they were turned violent by comic books. If your kid is violent then its probably a mental illness or much more likely you r just a bad parent
28733,"I had a teacher tell me once that video games caused violence, I then asked him what videos games they were playing during both world wars. He never said anything back to me."
28734,i fucking hate people that do this the media are so fucking dumb
28735,"So having guns in every home, ultra violence on tv is fine, its only the games thats the problem?Pathetic puritan hypocrites.The Falujah game is fine, why didnt you also ban Black hawk down then?Oh I lost my husband there, well maybe he shoudnt be killing people thousands of miles away...or even join the army.I feel for her..NOT.Anyway its the parents job to censor games that their kids play, not the goverments, the end."
28736,I love your controversies videos!
28737,"I was pissed when the mass shooting and bombing in Norway done by Andreas Breivik was connected with him playing WoW... Honestly, who the f*** thought that casting spells is the same thing as shooting guns..."
28738,Everything on this list is just because of dumb bullshit and video games do not cause mass shootings.
28739,Modern Warfare 3 pissed me of the most
28740,Hmmm
28741,"Yes, lets play games ! Not American firearm laws....."
28742,"There's no need to argue, parents just don't understand"
28743,Be careful i played Counter Strike
28744,"Hey watchmojo, How come your videos are only offered in 480 as the highest quality. Just wondering."
28745,i just feel that the families of these victims deserve a better excuse than video games. these people who talk about it on tv makethem seem like they are a threat to humanity. like we have progressed this much only to be taken down by video games. i refuse to believe that
28746,If video games cause violence in the real world. What games were they playing throughout history?
28747,"To be fair though, I did feel the torture scene in gta5 was uncalled for, and not fun"
28748,Pokemon is not evil some of my family thinks it's evil but I freaking grew up on pokemon and my favorite types r ghost psychic and dark
28749,"That first scene in ""No Russian"" still makes my stomach churn..."
28750,"Its so stupid.. Oh well he plays alot of shooters so that must be the cause! There probably was already something wrong with him before he even started those games, Probably something in his ""childhood"" I've been playing shooters since i was about 10. I'm 21 now. Have never killed someone in RL yet nor do i ever have the urge to do so.
Guess its just easy to blame the games instead of the people and maybe even the parents."
28751,"I wonder what games Hitler was playing... These ""controversies"" are so stupid."
28752,"Honorable mention: Jeff Gertsmann fired from Gamespot over the negative Kane & Lynch review. A minor controversy yeah, but it goes to show how full of bullshit video game journalism is."
28753,"Top ten idiots in power 
Please i'm a huge fan"
28754,"I always hate how people think video games cause shootings just because the shooter looked at a first person shooter. So just video games cause shootings. Nothing about the fact that the shooter had a mental illness. Nothing about the fact that they had behavioral issues, Nothing about the fact that they had a f***ing sub-machine gun!"
28755,#3 is f*** up
28756,THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS.
28757,Most of the overreaction is astonishingly raised by Fox News viewers. How hilarious.
28758,"In MW2 there is a warning and a option to skip ""No Russian"" for Christ's sake!"
28759,"I see all these activists pointing their fingers to video games as a prime suspect for shooting and such. But what about movies? There are arguably more violent and gruesome movies out there that one can point at. What about comic books? What about all art that showcases some type of violent act, or act that is against social convention and may seem amoral? Thing is all these activists have an agenda and will blame those who are clearly not to blame for the tragedies occurring. Play on gamers, I know I will."
28760,"I was waiting for the ""No Russian"" mission"
28761,WHAT WHAT MORTAL KOMBAT ONLY MADE NUMBER 7!
28762,"number 1 pissed me off the most, Videogames dont cause violence, its the person behind it, i've been playing violent videogames for a long time i havent done anything violent at all, its these fucking news people who just want something to write about and argue about something stupid and that is someones decision. Its fucking pathetic for these people to think that"
28763,Foolish elders... lucky for us that there aren't that many of them...
28764,"The Saints Row 4 Controversy in Australia was absolute bullshit. It was just about you taking Alien Narcotics to get new superpowers... That was so bad they had to ban it, they censored that mission out in the censored version but the alien probe rape gun is still in there?... Get your shit together straya."
28765,"0:37 It was your fault, Wheatley! You brought that part up! >:C"
28766,"SEE, THAT'S WHY THERE'S SO MANY STUPID LITTLE KIDS SAYING THEY HATE RUSSIANS, BUT NEVER SAW THE GOOD SOME OF THEM DID."
28767,"it pisses me off that that they blame video games for violence, it's just stupid if games were to blame then everyone who plays them will be outside shooting everyone and running over people with cars, isolated cases of mental illness should not be blamed on games"
28768,If video games are to blame for killings then why is it that me and countless others haven't murdered anyone?
28769,"I feel that every person on the media treats people who work on, enjoy, and play video games are idiots you can tell of that in the way they speak.... And plus half of these stories are ruled by soccer moms.... Ugh.... I hate people sometimes..."
28770,"I would like to see another top 10 anime list. A few suggestions include:

28774,OMG YOGSCAST KIM
28775,A: all of the things in theese videogames is not real all mass shotings is commited by a person that is already mentally il. B :if your are bumb enogh to think that a bunch of megabytes and pixels are the reason that these things are real then you are mentally challenged.
28776,Holy shit fallout got banned from Australia?
28777,"Hey, if you did Controversial games, how about controversial cartoons or anime? I know there's plenty..."
28778,The only one I kind of agree on is the one about the war. I mean come on. You can base it off the same time and shit like most WW2 games have but to make it exactly the way it was just..you know...doesn't feel right.
28779,"I'm not really sure if Six Days was ""cancelled"".
Its still in existence. Just in limbo, development hell."
28780,I already didn't like Fox News but This video has my blood boiling oh my son died so I am going to bitch and moan until someone can't play a video game. Boo fucking Hoo I am sick of this garbage. I wonder what people blamed when there wasn't videogames.
28781,"its true, vioence in video games does send people insane, hitler lost a game of virtual pong, and you know the rest."
28782,It seems like the only news outlet that has such a big problem with this is FOX News. They're just fucking idiots
28783,"Didn't the second to last Medal of Honor (tier 1) cause a stir because of the option of being able to play as the Taliban? I have to admit controversy like this completely passes me by as I rarely watch the news or actually care. I'm surprised there was not more GTA based entries, that could be a list in itself. I have to admit online play for anything like COD or BF is not a pleasant social experience, however war games have been proven to help with PTSD in soldiers that saw combat. Your welcome."
28784,"#1 makes me really mad because ""oh this person played COD so that's y he killed people"" no it's not. It is a mental illness. I want to c the people who think its bad to have kids playing COD if they play it they will not kill people. It's not just kids it's adults too."
28785,Video games cose violance? Really? Tell me then what games have people played science our begining ?I wana try them
28786,"I agree with number one, sure it might give you some violent fantasy but to actually carry the fantasy out demands more than just a game."
28787,it is the mental illness of people ! NOT THE GAME! look at WW2 people killed also eachother did they play videogames? NO so stop giving it all to the video games!
28788,Thank you lady at the end of the video
28789,"now before i say what i'm about to, understand i'm a brit, a gamer and i'm not trolling, with that said is it just me or is all the so called controversy brought up by ridiculous american religious organizations and stupid media monkey's like fox news? (auzzies aside) i will never understand why people, especially people in power latch onto a form of entertainment in droves like this just because it's deemed to be violent, and what pisses me off most is when said stupid american media monkeys then go onto say videogames are the cause of all the world's problems and yet have seem to have forgotten the two world wars that started back when nintendo were making playing cards, and that everyone who plays them is somehow a psychopath? 'm sorry but i've been playing videogames since i was old enough to know how to boot up a computer and i have yet to stab anyone and the idea that videogames are subliminal ways of teaching us how to be terrorists or bankrobbers is retarded, surgeon simulator doesn't make me a brain surgeon, kerbal space program doesn't make me a engineer and GTA doen't make me a master criminal, simply suggesting so is ridiculous. and the last thing that annoys me is parents who bitch and moan because their 6 year old is playing a game full of sex and violence even though there is a bog fat sticker at the bottom of the case that says mature ir adult, 15 or 18 if you're in the PAL region, if you don't want them playing a game like that then don't fucking let them, stop blaming everyone else for your lack of parenting ability, and if you are going to let them play it explain to them that it's make believe and the world is't really like that."
28790,the problems with the shootings is not video games it's the easy accesability of guns in the usa it doesn't happen anywhere else so everybody lets write to obama to ban buying guns in the usa exept for rare cases
28791,"I really fucking hate conservative media, and should every other gamer."
28792,the women who talked in the last clip is right. The guy could mental. CHECK YOUR FACTS NEWS PEOPLE
28793,Resident Evil 5 and the stupid racism crap.
28794,"Yeah lets ban video games, because it not like its the guns that were used to shoot people - American logic"
28795,"I find it irritating when they blame video games because films have things in like shootings and acts of terrorism, but no one takes any notice of them and they have been doing it for much longer and is obviously more realistic."
28796,Fox news are such whiny bitches
28797,Finally an interesting topic after long.
28798,"I recently read a new story about a gamer who had a heart attack or something like that because of the game. Everyone has illnesses but this story said it happened because he played to much. Yes some games are flashy and can cause strokes like the Dragon ball games or Pokemon. but they come with warnings, the news actually thought if you play games you will end up in the hospiitale. I'm sitting there thinking ""What the fucking hell?"""
28799,"i can understand why people think video games cause shootings, but what about the fact that you can order guns on the internet in some countries?"
28800,"You know why America has mass shootings? Maybe, guns..."
28801,"I definetly get the outrage over GTA and CoD, but the controversies over Pokemon or linking murders to games pisses me off"
28802,"It's mostly the yanks that spark controversy, it's hypocritical though because they allow people the right to own a gun. It's a mindless country that needs to be out in its place."
28803,Saints row 4 and state of decay are allowed in Australia

28807,"the ladie at then end was right, stupid news people, and i feel sorry for australialians"
28808,What makes me laugh with murders in the USA is that they always blame video games instead of the weapon's access ... If there wasn't weapons there wouldn't have such murders...
28809,Does anyone know the name of the game @3:30?
28810,"i think something that could make controversy is if someone blamed the parents for not looking at ratings which are their for a reason.
you cannot blame the game, there is nothing wrong with them. for example, if you look at gta and the characters it does anything but make you violent, who wants a life like nico bellic?"
28811,I'm surprised that the assassins creed series is in that list. U kill people instead series all the time!
28812,"For a while, I just could not give a shit about school shootings. Thats what they get with the stupid right to have a gun."
28813,"Perfectly normal people can see the difference between video games and real life, so if a mass shooting occurs, it probably happened because the shooter had a mental illness rather than the result of violent video games."
28814,Top 10 N64 games?
28815,"I don't believe gaming makes people go on killing rampages except for some weak mindedteens who can't distinguish art from realitybut showing studies that were done over 10 years makes no sense because they fail to study recent games which have changed quite a bit in maturity, realism, and violence"
28816,It's so friggin annoying that every single journalist & their moms accuse shooters for being the cause of the terrorist shootings!!!!
28817,"if you dont like the game, dont play it. im sure most games dont cause mass shootings lol"
28818,"es momento de hacer un juego en donde se emulen los mayores atentados terroristas de la historia, solo para mostrar que los videojuegos no son dainos para alguien mentalmente sano ^^"
28819,What about the controversy of the two developers who got arrested by the Greek government?
28820,Whitney Houston is right. We can't blame video games

28822,"""Emo kid killed a bunch of people after playing an adult violent video game"".
It's not the Game's fault. It's the fault of shitty parents who can't read and don't know the meaning of AGE RESTRICTIONS."
28823,"How dumb can a goverment be.... how dumb can people be.... Video Games aren't the cause for thse disasters, they are for entertain.... Why dont you blame movies? why dont blame bad parents? why dont you blame New's channels who in those times put more Real blood that pixel blood in games.... God new's and Over stuped people think tecnology its their enemy..... so then if i play Mario i will abuse of plant;s an animal' ? Damm im mad..."
28824,ok so if video games create mass shootings then what did people play in 1800s or 1900s someone wanna answer that. jeez some people just wanna find anything to argue about
28825,"Guns don't kill people, video games do! -Conservative logic"
28826,"Some people just need to grow the fuck up... Waaa war games will make people bad and mean and nasty! GTAV made serial killers waaaaa!!!
Can't these ignorant morns tell the difference between a GAME and real life?..."
28827,i hate the politicians that blame games for mass shootings. it really upsets me aswell. i love games and to be included to be one of these potential killers just makes me angry. its been proven that its not the case yet they still continue. im so glad that that the uk doesnt do it nearly to the extent as the american politicians. if i was an american then id probably be even more upset.
28828,it seems that only people who don't play video games claim that they have a negative effect on people and all of us gamers strongly disagree because for some of us its stress relief
28829,Video games affect ppl but not enough to make kids hurt ppl cuz the game if they do they have mental issues and ppl with mental issue shouldn't play violent games
28830,Guns do not kill people. People kill people. The media just always wants something to blame.
28831,"What annoys me is that people blame violence in games for being ""very realistic"".. To me that's a slap in the face of victims of real violence and/or terrorist attacks. Now, THAT'S realistic! Modern Warfare 2 and Grand Theft Auto is just a fucking game!"
28832,Hey guys i got a kem strike in ghosts.now im going to walmart to kill 25 people hope i get it....
28833,Try playing Battle field for a few hours then try picking up a real high caliber gun and shooting it and see how well that turns out for you.
28834,Whats dumb about parents and GTA it pisses them off but they still get it for there 10 year old because they whined and begged for it. great job parents
28835,Here's a terrible controversy: A child in Florida brought weapons and sex stuff to school and MINECRAFT was blamed for the incident. THE WORST CONTROVERSY EVER WTF

28837,"In the mission ""No Russian"" you did have to kill any civilians. It was your choice."
28838,Mw2 was nuts
28839,"MW2, best CoD game"
28840,Lmao damn dude was fucking that Indian ROTFLMAO
28841,"You can't blame video games for violence, do you think people 5000 years ago had them? I think not."
28842,I almost pissed myself laughing at number 1. Video games don't cause anyone to do anything bad! The number one cause of that is bad parenting 95% time!
28843,"I was thinking ""what kind of list would this be with out No Russian"""
28844,"Cooking Mama doesn't make me a cook
Surgeon Simulator doesn't make me a doctor
Why would games like GTAV make me a killer"
28845,"I remember when I first bought Bulletstorm and Fox News said you would ""Become a rapist"". My mum couldn't stop laughing, then she asked me if I had the urge to rape. Long story short, I'm not a rapist.......yet..... ;) lol"
28846,"I'm surprised resident evil 5 didn't make the list, people started calling the game racist because you were in Africa and you had to shoot black people, Capcom actually had to add it white people because of the negative media, I remember it was so stupid because Africans are, you know, black"
28847,"You can get saints row 4 in Australia, they just took some content out and the anal probe is dlc"
28848,"No Russian only killed that one security guard, plus it even says that it will offend you and gives you the option to skip it. Let's face it, blames got to go somewhere and these people seem to hate video games."
28849,America should blame themselves for making guns legal in the first place.
28850,Notice that almost all controversy is from Fox News -_-
28851,"I'll never understand people who are critical of video game violence. Haven't they heard the expression life imitates art? Well it goes both ways -- and violence has a much longer and colorful history than video games do, some 100,000+ years longer."
28852,Fucking pathetic to raise a stink over a little cartoon violence and sex.
28853,"In general all these linking's of video games to massacre's are stupid. If somebody is that sick in the head to pull something terrible like a massacre off, they were probably going to do it any way. Killing people virtually probably just satisfies them."
28854,"theyre video games, theyre meant for entertainment. it is no game or games fault why they could have influenced actions and besides all of these cases and controversies are very high reactions to things that should be of no concern."
28855,"I hate these old people that go on news shows when they nothing about games, and say shit about it."
28856,Fuck Censorship.
28857,ughhh they really know how to piss me off
28858,Am i the only one that noticed most of the news stories came from Fox news?
28859,San Andreas. One of my favorite games of all time.
28860,"God, i remember even as a kid how much of a sack of dog shit Jack Thomson was"
28861,"i've always hated this shit about ""games being the cause for insert everything here""! i've been a gamer for my whole life, from the Gameboy to the Xbox 360, and i have never thought about going around and killing people for fun! hell! the stuff PETA puts out gets me so mad cause i'm a big Pokemon fan and they're going around saying ""they kill and harm they're creatures"". that is bullshit! i've never done that and never will! News Channels, reporters, PETA! get your fakes straight and stop blaming gamers for problems in the world! IT'S! JUST! A! GAME!!!"
28862,very fast comments... ahaha
28863,Shooting guns in video games makes you a murderer in real life? I seem to recall hurting a lot of people by fire in Spyro. I guess I'm a S-Pyromaniac now.
28864,"I'm kind of disgusted with how people acted in response to these ""controversies."" Pokemon is demonic? Why don't people try learning about that which they try to condemn."
28865,Lol people are so arrogant.
28866,"why do people connect almost every mass killing with gaming?
like the clip at the end mental illness could have caused it, family issues or heartbreak (can happen) not a virtual reality were everything is FAKE not real"
28867,The funny thing is its almost always america who cries about video games
28868,Fox News is such garbage there always number 1 in having problems with everything bunch of fucking idiots.
28869,I love how all these controversies are made possible by people of USA. Only Americans cry this much about nothing. Country of hypocrites
28870,Anyone who takes Fox News seriously is ridiculous.
28871,"Its Fox News, are you gonna take them seriously?"
28872,"Consider this, if these people who are placing blame on games were at an age of 10-25, they would most likely buy the games therefore being hypocrites themselves. As for #1, where people are putting the blame on simulation games, THEY ARE ONLY GAMES. These people are trying to find things to blame other than the blatant fact that it is the motives of the person holding the trigger of the weapon is to be blamed. I understand where their point is coming from, however they cannot ignore important facts."
28873,"Weird that the left was always considered the slant of ""anti-war"" types, but now it's the right making all the stink over violence. How times have changed. I'm surprised God of War didn't make this list at all, with its nudity and sex minigames in every game and violence that's as over the top as any other game. Not sure why the series never generated any more controversy than it did."
28874,"I actually learned the MK blood code from a newspaper article that went something like ""Do NOT let your children press ABACABB!"" Thank you Cleveland Plain Dealer for potentially turning me into a mass murdering psycho because I saw too many red pixels that kinda sorta looked something like blood."
28875,just shows that they take video games too seriously

Spyro is a PS1 platformer / exploitation game and one of my favorite games of all time... theres 12 Spyro games spanning from 1998-2008 then we get the six games and Netflix show that make up the spinoff, Skylanders and a remake of the first three games (1998 - 2000) is coming out this November... and out of all theses games one proved too scary for me so I got rid of it and havent even considered watching a lets play of it now that Im older.... 
My point is, if you dont have the self control not to repeat what youre seeing on your screen maybe dont play violent games, but not all games are bad, I played action heavy games and was able to exercise my eyes to the point where I no longer needed reading glasses, platforming as a kid helped improve my hand - eye coordination and surprisingly, my balance too... (which when you have Cerble Paulsy is a big help to being able to move towards independence) I would love to see you guys do a part two of this where you talk about the benefits of gaming for people with and without disabilities (please feel free to use my stories.... just call me the Emerald Queen)"

29058,"I actually used myself as a test subject. I played two violent videogames and then watched a very violent shock video (I will not state this shock video to save your eyes, but, it was bad)
I noticed that I was appalled by the shock video, not the violent video games. I theorize that this is because I know that video games are not real. But, I knew that in the shock video, the person dying was a real person. With real personality.
I didn't feel that way in games. I felt neutral.
So in the end, I don't think that realism in graphics will contribute to violence, as you don't feel connection to what is being killed.
You need to be disconnected from a person in order to kill them with no remorse. This feeling of disconnect is only caused through either environmental factors, or flaws in brain development."

When I play a game that involves killing its fun cause there just computer bots not real people plus I can just restart from the last checkpoint and oh look at that the computer bots are up and alive again theres nothing wrong about violent video games or at least in my experience.

29204,"I think I heard somewhere that video games actually reduce violent impulses as they are an outlet for an aggression, not fuel for it. Playing a violent video game when frustrated or upset can be cathartic and release pent up stress. Similarly, if someone is at home playing a video game they aren't out in the street committing crimes. 
The only instance in which games generally aren't relaxing is if they are competitive which can be frustrating and stressful."

29249,"I think the question if they make you violent is beside the point. 
Shouldn't it be about how it often displays ""good"" vs ""evil"" side in some or other setting? 
Most wargames don't show that on both sides there are just people like your neighbors and your loved ones and the only reason
they are killing each other is because some already ridiculously rich people want to become even richer or more powerful.
And one of the reasons we have these games is to keep the mindset of glory and honor to die for your nation alive... 
Even if you commit murder, so what that they are from another place you think that makes it ok?
Even if it's in a game... how come it is ok? It's so normal playing to killing people nobody thinks about it anymore as something horrendous."

29273,"Great video, but one important thing to remember is how susceptible a young person's mind is - killing people in games can make 5 year olds, or even 10, think that it's ok to do in real life; that's why age ratings are so important.
I am not saying video games do make people more violent, I hate that argument as more violent games can be useful for releasing stress (I like to turn to smash bros), but it's important to be aware young kids learn things easily, both good and bad."

29288,Far as I see though if science is about physical results then far as causing violence and aggression. Schools=13 Games=1. Proof enough for me. Though it should be noted one is to many.

29322,Fun fact I went to UTSA and one of my professors was one of the leading experts in video game psychology and his results were trending more toward the emotion (aggravation/satisfaction) and not the actually game itself - meaning violent games had no stronger effect on emotions than a difficult 8 bit game.
29323,Does that mean brain games don't help you at all?

29352,"I was a child of the 70's and 80's--when video games were JUST starting to ""become something"".  I've heard this story sooooo many times, it's stupid we aren't learning to avoid stupid correlations. 
And... as always, violence only comes from these types of factors:
1.  Frustration -- with one's true life issues (so, not just spilling water on one's shirt).
2.  Fear -- of whatever it might be--whether for one's life (literal), or... a sense of dread that one's life is out of control.
3.  Sadness -- whether because of what others say or do around you that make you feel worthless... or, one's own inner demons.
4.  The presence of violence (already) -- whether in one's youth, environment and so on... or, just as a ""way of life"" in one's country.
5.  Desperation -- whether for money, power, food... or even to ""help"" a loved one... or oneself (even though it rarely does).
6.  Hopelessness -- Basically... the summation of 1-5.  :(
Anyone who has experienced any or all of these knows what I mean.  BUT... and this is important... just BECAUSE one experiences 1-6 in whatever form--doesn't absolutely predicate that one will end up... well... acting with violence.  :)
I should know.  I feel 1-6 all the time.  For 20+ years, lol.  It is what it is.  And I've yet to ""attack"" or to ""attempt to murder"" ANYONE, lol."
29353,I think if someone goes on a killing spree and blames in on (ex) MW3 then they were probably messed up in the head to begin with and needed a reason or cushion to do said action in the first place.
29354,"ASAPSCIENCE!
Well, being in the mental health field, (Im just a trainee at this point; I havent done or read any studies on the subject so this is just an opinion), its difficult to see how a video game would cause violence. Theres no real interpersonal communication with just a base video game. The video game has functions, not real interactions. Things that would cause violence in a person are human interactions, the way theyre treated by others, how theyre raised, what their personality type is, genetics, etc. One caveat to these studies done on finding a link between video games and violence is the online part (none of it was mentioned in the studies); the human interaction part of some video games that could be considered bullying and teasing, threats and whatnot. That then falls more along the lines of cyber bullying. But we all know how the majority thinks about bullying and teasing not being a factor for violent behavior. ."
29355,"Not my Bradly! Many Brads are good people. 
The highest rate of A holes in games come from DOTA 2. So much salt. But they probably won't commit crimes. Some of them are just cranky pompous A holes.
Start early with kids.
Education. Positive connection with Role models. Connection with community. Physical health through proper nutrition. Knowing how to fulfill needs in a positive way. Learning gratitude and how to create regardless of circumstances. Purpose and meaning in life. That will lower crime rates."

We all prime differently. Lol"
29361,"Yeah, I don't buy this. Look at all the gamers who trash their consoles and controllers. They weren't playing Pac-Man, I'm telling you that... There's a reason why I stopped playing online with people. I became more aggressive than usual and I've seen people becoming aggressive on there as well. Unless they are like one of my friends who is naturally aggressive at everything, they would probably be less aggressive if they weren't playing aggressive video games. The mind does not perceive fantasy as fantasy, it perceives it as real. We know it's not, but the mind doesn't. I've seen countless videos about this stuff, and it's all scientific. All I'm saying is that if you're prone to aggression naturally, it's best not to feed it with more aggression."
29362,How do these guys animate their videos??

29395,"The worrying party about video games is not the medium, it's the narrative behind each video game. For example, if the game's solution to every problem is ""shoot your way out"", it makes our way of thinking oversimplified and crude, just as art influences humanity."

29406,"Nah... Instead, real life makes me want to play violent games."
29407,will this theory ever die?
29408,The only time I witnessed this be true is my little brother. He couldn't even watch us play the game but he has a mental problem so that's probably why
29409,Can you make a video on the scientific differences between the way men and women think?
29410,"I've played video games (Doom, Duke Nukem 3D, Wolfenstein, Heretic, etc) back when I was 3 years old. I used God Mode (my dad gave me the cheats, lol) so I wouldnt die in like 5 seconds.
I've played games ever since. Unreal.. Half-Life 1 and 2, Call of Duty, Diablo, Guild Wars, etc.
I play video games as a way to stimulate my brain. It's like doing 100 situps or 50 pushups in the morning before work.
I don't ever think violent thoughts, I am a genuine pacifist and I avoid confrontation as much as possible. I know self defense just so I'm more at ease and not as anxious about the actions of others.
I'm also very empathetic. I cringe when I see horror movies, and my nose tickles and I feel at the verge of crying when my favorite character in an MMO game, movie or TV show dies. I have to remind myself (it's not real, it isn't real). And that helps me relax.
If it's the on the news or something, it's sickening. I understand that people do hurt others because they're also hurting on the inside. It's their way of letting it out. It's who they are and I think it's something nobody can control. Everybody is different, but I feel video games helped me be more aware of death. It's both a blessing and a curse."
29411,"Nice video but some really lame testing methodology. Also, if not video games and/or TV/movies, WHAT IS CAUSING ALL THE VIOLENCE THESE DAYS?! Where should the conversation be?"
29412,"when the video game argument comes up that they will try to mimic it or be influenced to be violent, my response is always the same: if you cannot discern the difference between the video game fantasy and reality to the point where it IS the cause of your aggression, something else is already wrong in the first place."
29413,I played some Euro Truck Simulator and now I want drive a truck and murder some hookers.
29414,"No. Studies by University of New York debunks that. Not just that. Government claims marijuana is a gateway drug, when alcoholics are 2 times more likely to be addicted to heroin and also 2 times more likely to be smokers"

29419,But maybe these games can bring out your masculinity? Maybe you'd be in touch with your masculine side more than your feminine likewise when little girls associate themselves with any beauty relating games and whatnot
29420,I actually feel fortnite made my brother more aggressive and violent
29421,Thank you very much for this video as I will show anyone who regards this topic this video! I also did a debate on this topic and I won so yea
29422,"What about certain types of pornography (real of fictional) and their proposed connection to harmful/illegal sexual behaviors? That's arguably a more hot-button topic than violence in video games, which has largely fallen out of the public discourse since the 2000s."

29429,"If gaming makes you violent, then you were already violent."

29432,Does playing Surgeon Simulator make me a surgeon?
29433,I've played Counter Strike since I was 5 and now I'm 17 and hasn't shot a single round in my life
29434,"I've been playing games since I was a child and I'm in my 30s now. I play cod, GTA, Hitman and Quake and I've never laid hands on anyone. Games make these criminal acts you do in them more real and show the negative outcome. When you kill someone in gta, the police come and shoot you, or spend a lot of time trying to do so making you have to do even worse things to try and avoid it. In the real world, until you do these bad things, you don't really feel like it will happen and that you can just do what you want. You kind of experience the bad side of violence without having to go through it in life to decide you don't want to hurt people. I've also watched some of the most violent movies ever made and it just makes those things even more repulsive to try and do in the real world."
29435,it depends who you are and how much the game's impact is on you
29436,"Video games dont make you violent, introverted people are just more likely to play video games so if you put them in a social situation they might react differently/more aggressively, is my hypothesis"

29447,"You should look into this again but with metal music, so people stop associating metal with violence or suicide."
29448,No
29449,If this is true then what is influence? Why does rappers glorifying drugs make more people want to do drugs and or sell drugs? Why do companies pay outrageous prices for commercials? Why do things become trendy? What made pokemon GO the hottest thing since MJ for a week? If you do not see links in violence and watching violence then you are ignorant of the science. If you watch nothing but slasher movies for weeks on end chances are they won't make you flinch anymore. If you watch a ton of zombie movies or post apocalyptic movies about killing to survive. Well chances are you will not hesitate to kill someone in real life based on your understanding of how that world works.

He began to believe that he WAS the Punisher and went to go punish some law enforcement. People like him latch onto the games and are the reason the rest of us can't have nice things. It's like saying being elected class president makes students narcissists because some A students here and there suddenly become attention hogs after getting elected. Heck, the kids from the last generations who played Cowboys and Indians didn't all grow up to be shooters."
29477,I said lemon... :(

 More time playing games= less time consuming Tv, and therefore less investments in ads from the companies. In Brazil we had a clear example of this: a teenager killed his aunt and a tv journalist accused the game, later when the company of the game paid him, he did a advertising for them!

29559,"from my experience with the majority of people I know that games in my country (me and my brother are running our countries gaming community) most aren't prone to violence the one that are are usually dumb kids and/or just has some mental illness. the millennials over here are just more spoiled so they lash out on they're parents being little brats. so its less about the games themselves and more the upbringing. at least that's how its seems considering all that I see in the event, on our page and when we go around visit ""friends"" (thanks to gaming community we have allot of dedicated gaming buddies that we visit)"

29599,"The real question is how does video game-induced agitation affect people with pre-existing mental illness or tendencies toward violence? If you give prisoners highly aggressive, violent video games, it's there any doubt about subsequent increases in violence?

29605,"I agree with the video. My brother plays games a lot. Like Halo, skyrim etc, he even plays live with his friends where he is shooting other players in the game. HE has been playing for the past ten years and I don't think he has changed negatively. He is still the same calm and relaxed person. I also play games like tomb raider, skyrim etc. These games involve killing characters, fighting them and stuff. I don't feel that I have changed that much. I didn't want to hurt anyone before I started playing and I still don't want to hurt anyone."

Long story: my cell mate keeps looking at me wierd. I think he wants to play Smash"
29623,"No sir
 It is more of the parents not telling these kids it is fake and not real world stuff. 
I played mortal kombat and other games in the 90s. I love killing things in games but I'm not going to go shoot up a school. I am sane and smart. I use video games as a stress relief. Kill some zombies after work for an hour and I'm relaxed."
29624,what about online team games and real life toxicity?
29625,It really pisses me off when my parents or these politicians/tv people  try to say video games are violent when they have never touched a video game in their life.

29638,"Since I played Zelda, I'm a great gardener"
29639,Have to show This to my parrents :)
29640,"Surely, though, Playing violent games, normalises violence, which in turn promotes violence as a way to solve things... perhaps, in an adult mind it doesn't lead to violence maybe because one has more life experience... but as a child who are easily influenced,  it makes violence acceptable. As a teacher I do see very different behaviour from children who play violent video games for most of their free time and those who play a variety of things on and off line."

29656,single mothers make their children violent and aggressive not games smh
29657,The myth that video games couse violence was strongly enforced by gun manufacturers to push away any blame for mass school shootings and because american media rely on fear and politicians on money (bribes) from wealthy sponsors like often fire arm companies this lie is repeated over and over.

29686,"True, but violent people do play violent video games and probably fetishize them"
29687,Bullshit
29688,The Sims are not considered a violent game and oh boy have I killed many Sims in every possible game.

Why is it surprising that aggressive person might play aggressive video games?"
29692,I wanna jump onto a spiky turtle
29693,Short answer: no and the media talk shit about it blaming everything violent in games

29706,"I think what makes violet video game behavior is not being able to beat a damn level. I used to get pissed as child and in my late teens. Eventually I realized that it's dumb to get so mad over a video game as would stop playing when I'd feel the ager arising. Of course I was already an angry child that was easily triggered and the aggressive behavior was due to childhood abuses which I've since confronted, forgave and overcome, btw. I don't even play games now due to motion sickness. I don't even own a computer, tv or gaming console. just my Android. 
I don't necessarily believe that tv or games causes violence in children bit coupled with a bad upbringing it could cause child to become numb... ( Not the word I'm looking for but it's too early ) DESENSITIZED THAT'S IT!! I think watching too much violence can cause a person to become desensitized because it's happened to me. I could probably walk up on a dead body and not think twice about it. I mean I would be hurt by it because I'm pretty empathetic but it would almost seem fake. And I know this from experience.

29708,I started a town in Animal Crossing and now I'm gonna rob a bank
29709,"Though I don't believe games can be seen as a cause, I do wonder what happens if you run these tests on people that have shown violent behavior in the past or have i.e. high levels of testosterone. Maybe it triggers something different in those individuals.."
29710,"I wasn't aware that people still believed video games made you violent, wasn't that the 80's and 90's?
Violent video games and real violence are both potential outlets for violent urges, thus it's to be expected that some people try both. Correlation doesn't equal causation."
29711,I was gonna lemon.. to the yellow fruit. Is that a fruit? Yeah. Yeah I'm sure it is..

He would end up turning off the game and messaging me that he got pissed and had to turn off the game. But not only it was the game that mad him mad but I am guessing he has angry issues that  would also  contribute to aggression. But o well I hope he gets help with his anger issues in life and while playing video games

29770,"I play Minecraft , so I must kill animals in the real world"
29771,"Well as a video gamer consumer I can say from my experience, that is pretty long, that they don't make you violent, BUT (this is a very Big but) the community around It and the people who play It YES, although communities of videogames aren't all cancerous or disrespectful as call of duty or league of Legends, most of the competitives ones usually are, so in the end, people who play this games, for example, kids or teenagers, tend to adapt their attitude to this type of games by copying the other and tend to insult everybody so they can survive in that sort of ""ecosystem"".
So in the end, a videogame won't make you a serious killer or a bully but the community around It will definetily define your attitude if you let It do It."

However, those that have anger management issues or mental problems should seek counseling in my humble opinion, so as not to cause any undue stress or aggression towards others. People that play video games in general should also have another hobby, such as book reading, listening to music, watching TV/Movies, sports, et cetera, et cetera."

The science is actually very clear - violent media is both correlated with violent behaviour and it's a causal factor in violent behaviour - both in short and long terms. This has been thoroughly investigated decades ago and has been confirmed again and again over the years. Why not mention these studies? Many major bodies in the US (assuming you live there, I don't), have definitively stated this very thing - violence breeds more violence.
Your best argument on your biased side is that 'video games' per se don't cause violence. Which is true - 'violent video games' do. Which, to be honest, is what people care about - I doubt people believe chess leads to violent behaviour. I hope you actually do some research in future.

Really needs an update too the physics seem weird now. They got rid of floating blocks but everythings so HD now and round and squishy.. also I must be playing on peaceful because I havent seen any mobs just a lot of other players who I stab with my sword for loot. Never have much on them now. Usually just one piece of leather and some green paper squished in between it with peoples photos on it... my inventory is gone now too but I can still dual wield but they mustve added a weight system like in fallout so I can only carry so much. Also the days and nights last for like 12hours... weird huh. Also they added mods like guns and police into the game...and cars. Welp theyre at my door but dont know about all the red stone traps I set up waiting for grievers who try and steal my loot! Bring it on you pig fucks!

29990,Do one about if they make you sexist!  That's a popular social myth too.
29991,"I mean, i think it's pretty obvious that video games don't make you a criminal or violent. It's called common sense.
I think the argument is rather, do video games influence an already violent person to replicate an act of violence from the video game? We see plenty examples of this, where some killers are inspired by games/movies/tv shows etc. It is possible that violent media can exacerbate violent tendencies and motivate someone to turn their violent fantasies into a reality. 
People seem to hone in on video games, but the same effect is given by ALL forms of media. Even news coverage of a past crime can inspire a criminal to commit a similar act. In short, violent media   violence or the creation of criminals. Instead, it can influence how that violence is expressed by a criminal or already criminally prone person."
29992,"One of my close relatives was murdered while she was babysitting a kid who had shot and killed people in video games and wanted to see how it felt in real life. So yes, in extreme cases, video games can lead to violence, but only as a very, very uncommon exception to the rule."

30022,Slowly just going through comments
30023,I hope that more studies are being done on this. I have different beliefs myself but I understand how scientists could come to these conclusions. I also think that its important to rule in different mental states and habits as well as playing time and addiction factors. I think that the live gaming aspect (playing online with others all at the same time) could also affect the results as well as the type of game including violence. To each his own.

30057,"whatever the ""scientific studies"" (aka make a few people play a video game once and test them immediately after, rather than looking at how constant immersion in violent video games over a period of time affects a person, especially a child) say, that doesn't change the fact that kids at the preschool i work at watch their parents/older siblings playing violent games and then they come to school and pretend to shoot and kill each other, normalizing the idea of gun violence in their minds before they even really understand what death is. does that sound healthy to you?"

30096,"I've played videogames for almost 20 years, specially the most violent ones. I think they gave me a better understanding of how violence works and it's consequences, ultimately making me a more empathic person who avoids physical confrontation as much as possible.

A. Never played a game and know it's just past time and vent real world aggression to just a bunch of codes.

30153,"Right-wingers have a post-truth ideology. To most right-wingers, facts don't matter. It seems like most of the smears they use against the left are simply psychological projection.
Many of their positions are based on fear or feelings over facts.

30164,"Large acts of violence are not caused by every day people, they're caused by a handful of lunatics.  The question shouldn't be, do video games make YOU more violent, the question should be: if you were the type of person who was likely to perform a large act of violence, would video games push you over the edge?  
I think we've all sat here and confirmed time and time again that the former question is a resounding no, but I rarely hear anyone talk about the effect of videogames on mentally unstable people."

30166,"I don't know if science backs this up and I haven't even watched the video yet, but I have the belief that video games don't make you violent, but you have the ability to be violent.

30259,"My favorite games are fighting,so if games were violent than I'd be beating the crap outta everyone."
30260,About the yellow thing I thought about a lemon not a banana..
30261,Yes I killed a whole group of people becuase video games lmao if humans were that easily influenced our species would be doomed don't even need studies just use your brain for 2 seconds.
30262,"Monopoly, the loser should always flip the board"
30263,Video games are a just a scapegoat for politicians who dont want to address the real concern. MENTAL HEALTH
30264,"Care to provide the sauce to the ""top 5 most popular games are all shooters""?"
30265,Short awnser no
30266,"I played pubg 
Now I wanna run over some people and shoot them to death"
30267,"Video games are for below 18 people and only for a few hours a week, other than that you are just wasting your life and need to get a life"
30268,I killed a goomba in Mario and immediately felt the urge to murder real people.
30269,its tru i played fallout and now im making peoples limbs explode :(
30270,Niop
30271,No matter how hard you show this video to your parents they still won't listen. Smh lose/lose situation.
30272,Artillery please
30273,Glad to hear that I can play Grand Theft Auto without feeling bad afterwards.
30274,"Yes
Reason: Because my mom said so"
30275,DAMN RIGHT BABY. VIDEO GAMES DONT DO SHIT. EAT IT ADULTS
30276,Im violent and I never play video games
30277,Hey lets blame all our problems in something we don't understand. Basically every politician
30278,Video games sadly have been used time and time again as political/religious escape goat...
30279,I played BF1 so now i wanna go back in time  and shoot down some biplanes with an AA gun!!
30280,They forgot to account for the effects of lag
30281,"Spot the difference 
 "
30282,Short answer: No
30283,It's your choice
30284,"If video games cause violence, then how, as the sales have gone up, has the crime rate dropped like a stone?"
30285,"Overwatch didnt make me violent, just angry. Thats why I sold dat shit"
30286,Im below the breadline. Cant afford the sponsor but Im glad I can still plug away at my genesis without needing to stomp on turtles
30287,My mom says so...
30288,"Videogames don't make people violent
violent people play videogames"
30289,Actually i said lemon
30290,"Ive played video games for 10 years, since I was 5 years old. Ive also been playing violent video games with lots of shooting/killing in them such as GTA since I was 5. I am a female so I may be different to males however I do not swear and I find I am a very happy person even though I have grown up playing shooting games."
30291,"Now when games start to lag, that's another story"
30292,Maybe because i said so.
30293,"They dont make you violent, they make you indifferent to the violence"
30294,"So if I play a game with football, basketball or soccer does that make me an athlete?"
30295,No.
30296,No. Funny thing is when parents want to blame video games for violence yet they're letting children playing rated M games. They have to be the ones to buy the games since they're the adults
30297,I am primed to be violent.
30298,Lag that make people violent
30299,"Video games don't cause violence, but instead vents it. Some types of games neutralise it completely."
30300,Answer is yes I have killed 234 people IRL after dying in fortnite
30301,Video games don't make me vicious slow wifi makes me viciously insane
30302,"Monkey see, monkey do"
30303,Don't talk about my video games...I'M A VIOLENT PERSON I'LL MESS YOU UP!
30304,No
30305,"Thanks, Scishow. I hope this gets the word out there lol"
30306,Y E S
30307,"Short answer: No
Long answer: No"
30308,No.
30309,Easy answer: NO.
30310,Rainbow six siege makes me Violent
30311,plays video games**turn into brutal warlords
30312,No. Gtfoh
30313,"...
...
...
I said lemon"
30314,Politicians want to use video games as a scapegoat because they don't want people to find out that poverty and shitty mental health care are what mainly lead to violence.
30315,"Some games however, make people want to destroy their gaming platform. Cough cough cuphead."
30316,Where was this 6 months ago when I was writing my paper
30317,"They won't make you successful with girls.
I should know..."
30318,"Joe Lieberman, is that you?"
30319,"well yeah. Violence against controllers has got to stop :P I've gotten INCREDIBLY frustrated/angry with playing video games in my life. Never once has it ever occurred to me to go and take it out on someone. Cause yeah my parents taught me some damn common sense , difference between fantasy and real life and consequences for my behaviour...."
30320,Well Mario Kart has yet to influence me to chuck banana skins at other drivers.. as much as I may want to sometimes.
30321,Finally read Catcher in the Rye.....KILL JOHN LENNON! KILL JOHN LENNON!
30322,After playing Mario cart I just want to throw a turtle at the cars in traffic
30323,someone send this to my mum please
30324,"Do video games make us violent? 
I don't know, can they??"
30325,"Thank you lord, so happy you made this"
30326,"Dam, playing Tetris really makes me wanna murder people."
30327,"I think the correlation is more that people that are already more violent tend to enjoy violent video games, so people assume the video games are causing the violent behavior instead of simply enabling it."
30328,"Oh, I said lemon"
30329,THANK YOU THANK YOU SOME MAKE KNOWN AROUND THE WORLD
30330,"I played some Kirby, and went on a bloodthirsty killing spree."
30331,It corrupts children according to the Today show in Australia.
30332,Short answer: Yes. I jump out of flying busses and kill people all the time
30333,"No, but lag does."
30334,"I think it comes down to parents forgetting that they need to parent their kids. People, from what Ive seen while working in the medical field, tend to have kids and think that schools and society will help their kids grow into the adults theyre expected to be. While all that does influence a person, its up to the parents to also teach them whats right and whats wrong, morals and most importantly, being rational."
30335,Wow I'm early
30336,No but lagging can.
30337,No.
30338,They use it as a scapegoat TO distract us from what's really causing it.

30349,"If I play Red Dead Redemption 2, will ut make me more Cowboy?"
30350,"I've been playing video games since I was 7. I've wanted to kill people since I was 3.
Moral of the story: no, i don't think video games don't make you violent"
30351,Living in America and having easy access to guns makes people violent. Just sayin

30430,"Hello lovely people on YouTube ,
(From an Indian village)
Scroll down and don't even give a sight to this comment if you don't have time to read someone's story, I don't know how to start but there is a story which can be said as dream, a dream which is important, I personally don't wanna make this jiggle and so going straight forward to the point, I am 17 and I thought that one day I will become the reason of no poverty in my country, I grew up with this dream but seriously there was no way for me to publically do what I dreamt of but when I bought my first phone (technically dad) there was YouTube, I was amazed with its concept, listen I know that even if I grew big here and donated all the Adsense , it wont be sufficient for mass poverty reduction but thinking about my dream had me some great ideas, what if I start (after growing big on YouTube and becoming a public influencer) start public to public service. I don't know how but. I failed ! Bro I failed! There was a dream which was like everything for me, I don't wanted to be a politician (no doubt I hate politics) but I wanted to a public influencer. It is true that anything is possible to a willing , no doubt, but I failed!! I started YouTube channel where I thought of making videos about people's biographies which would motivate me but ... One year about to complete, 50 fully animated videos about to complete, whole night working for YouTube about to end but still 800 subs , I can't really deal with it, I work like I earn from YouTube but the reality is that I am not even applicable for monetization. My dream is (if not was) everything for me, I keep slapping me to try once more and so ....like...  Guys! Would you support me? Please  I really can't describe everything here with words, please  I beg uh, everyone, please, Jake Paul literally got famous when he was 16, I am not comparing myself with him as they are celebs now but still my dream is better than what they do, I'm sure everyone from you (If I'll have your support) will feel proud for me oneday,
Great day.."

1919,"The problem with Thanksgiving is that it is all so fake. Everyone says they are grateful for this or that but  no one truly appreciates things on a deeper level. People still take things for granted. The holiday has become an excuse for every American home to slaughter a bird  and eat too much of food that isnt good for you with your family. Where has the meaning gone? Do we just blindly follow traditions without thinking about what we are actually doing, because we are used to doing it? Are the morals that Thanksgiving is trying to teach being neglected? Should we not be expressing these morals year round? Why limit our gratitude for what we have to a single day?
Appreciate what you have. You never realize how much you care about something until you no longer have it.",0

Also if your playing video games, the technology just isn't ere yet to actually show real life visuals of someone's heads exploding, it's usually pixelated because the games are already rendering so much, it can't have that show up perfectly. And parent should actually do their job and monitor what their kids are doing because if their kid is 8 years old and hears rumors about a really popular game that is AO, and his parents buy him it anyway, that is their fault you can't blame it on the child, and finally these mass shooters can't be blamed for playing GTA V and then going out and shooting up the neighborhood, that's not the video games fault, that's a mental issue they might have had

4271,I'm writing a paper on video games and looking at different articles and stuff and all I want to say is that parents can see if a video game is violent or not without knowing anything about the game. Every game has a rating from E for everyone to M for mature.  If you're a parent that wouldn't want your kids to watch a rated R movie then just look at the game's rating before you buy it for them. That's a really easy solution.,0

People just choose gaming as it is the easiest factor to blame it on and it attacks every gamer out there. Not just gamers either, those who watch movies, listen to music, or even reading books! The media uses gaming to make a good story and ends up just frustrating gamers. Let's use this philosophy with the Bible... It holds violence in it with David hitting Goliath with a slingshot and Jesus being nailed to a cross. Why don't we ban the bible and churches for this then? It does the exact same thing to people but is praised by many. Do you know why they don't ban it? Because violence in media don't cause violence. it is the people with their own problems or factors encouraging them.",0

4326,"So according to Fox News and stupid braindead Conservatives, I should be one of the world's top fighters because I play Tekken. I can beat virtually anybody in a real life one on one fight because I play Tekken. Video games may affect kids, but it starts at home. When the parents see little Billy or Mary Sue playing Mortal Kombat or Halo and they're starting to turn violent on them. Maybe instead of being scared of your own kids or spoiling them, be a damn parent and tell your kids what's up and punish them. Take things away from them that they cherish the most for like a week or 2. The main problem isn't games, it's these parents ain't shit these days and that's why you have things called Whoa Vicky, Lil Tay and Bhad Bhabie running around. Be there for your kids, love them. Make them feel special and loved and discipline them when they step out of line. If they feel hurt, angry or sad about something and they need someone to have an open mind and open ears, listen to them. Have a talk to them It's that simple. This proves people like Donald Trump, Conservatives and Fox News don't really represent a ""Non PC/Anti-SJWs"" group of people. They're also apart of the problem that they love to preach against. It's not musical artists, video game companies, and Hollywood to teach YOUR children from right and wrong, it's YOUR job as parents. Sub-Zero, Chun-Li, The Master Chief, Supergirl, Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, Batman etc. isn't your kid's parents, YOU are as the parent!

I do believe though that video game may distract others and create a shorter attention span since individuals are engaged within a fast paced environment.  The reason why, I agree with Ben Shapiro on this topic is because I do believe it is up to the parent to decide on what they want to be giving their child.  From a personal experience I remember going into Game Stop and trying to buy a game that was rated M when I was 12 and the cashier wouldn't sell to me because I wasn't old enough.

Don't rely on how much you see it on the news and, consequently, how easily you can recall it (availability heuristic). Look at the actual statistics. While it is true that many studies have discovered a strong correlation (and some even a causation via experimental random selection), it is also true that studies have found NO LONG TERM effect.

I mean, I know that I for one, as a kid flew around on my magic dragon all the time because I had thought of it the day before, so obviously it happened in real life. Now if you excuse me, I just got shot 20 times in the chest, so I'm going to crouch behind a wall for about 3 seconds and all the bullets will vanish!",0
4951,Right so I've played video games all my life and shot a gun for the first time and found it much more difficult then how its portrayed in a game.

Long answer: nooooooooooo.",0

no, if you said yes you are so sooooo stupid  you would rather blame games instead of physical problems that cause violence ( don't do fakenews, you will die way sooner than you think )

4976,"Video games don't make you violent. I asked my 8 year-old sister, who plays video games, if she will do what she sees on the screen in real life. Her answer was, ""No, we can't apply what we see in video games in real life."" And video games don't make you skilled at anything in real life. I mean, I should have been an excellent player if that logic was true. And for the shooting that happened in the school in Florida, the fact that that boy used to play video games has nothing with what he did. Anyone can take a gun and start shooting people randomly. If he actually showed some skills in his attack, then we can start blaming video games for that. Since that did not happen, some adults don't want us to think that because of their lack of responsibility, there kids turned out to be the wrong kind of people they wished them to be. What happens in video games is not real, and that is clear to everyone who plays. And do you know what is more frightening than video games? Showing people shooting each other during a war on the news. Why? It is because we are aware that video games are not real but wars are! I know I might be so wrong in some of what I said, so let me know if I am wrong, so I can delete the comment. Thanks for anyone who read this long comment.",0
4977,Also never take games from kids it can make them depressed and so board the only fun thing is drugs sex and murder,1

4979,Proven studies have shown girls play 3x  as much games as guys and the youth violence has dropped by 60% also assassination  that's in 18+ games if your don't want your kid playing them don't buy them it's not like they can buy them they are too young... also schools are using games to teach kids,0
4980,So books which you can use your imagination... which could be 100x  as gory is not bad for you,0

4990,I'm not into politics but its funny how when the guy on the right brings up the fact that the popularity of games has gone up and the crime rate has gone down the 2 dumbasses look at him like he is stupid and say its not relevant. The guy on the right is dumb as shit and i would cum on the females face.,0
4991,"This has nothing to do with gaming. What it is, in fact, is lazy parenting. Games are rated, parents should know better than to get these for their very young kids. If you think your child can handle it, why not sit down and talk with them about what is and isn't right or moral? Oh, because parents these days are lazy and would rather the government parent for them. It's sickening.",0
4992,"I got spawn peaked by a tachanka
Time to grab my AR and shoot up the school",0
4993,Ben ended this when he said statistics prove otherwise but i respect his approach toward his kids but nobody is gonna take my world away from me because its sth we have in common with most criminals  last time i checked most humans play video games most humans eat take a dump and sleep so we should focus on these issues as well,0
4994,Idiotic if you think video games produce violence. Forgot there was never a murder before GTA was ever released.,0
4995,that guy was having a really good COD game,0
4996,"So, do you think the columbine school shooters were normal people berfore they came in contact with videogames? So stop talking about video game violence and focus more on the fact that in the US gun control is a joke. And even mentaly ill citizens can aquire a gun really easily",0
4997,"Video Games train to kill, just like Clue trains people to get away with murder.",0
4998,"i liked what Shapiro said... i dislike what Fox and Trump are doing (basically the same tactic on the Left) blaming the violence on an inanimate object instead of facing the problems with current legislation. Also if you want to talk about the promotion of violence to our youth, why not call out the rappers that young men in the inner cities idolize and strive to rise their ""street cred"" Personally i think rap is fine as long as you follow the same logic as video games, Entertainment is not reality so dont try and replicate it. PS. many gamers are right wing and have been since the media has tried to step in and make certain titles ""politically correct"", in other words, youre chopping down the wrong tree FOX",1

Being really good at halo or call of duty wont turn you into a serial killer, lmao.
I know here on the right side of the world it's all about statistics and about every school shooter was a gamer, so that means gamers are potential school shooters????

Like throughout human history long before electronics you will still see violence, in fact much worse. Jesus the whole natural balance lies on basically violence. Look at the animal kingdom. Some people will be violent like their nature tells them to and others know that being human comes with intelligence and therefore should act beyond violence. What I am trying to say is some people will always be violent and some people will not. Like 99.9% percent of gamers don't kill anyone. Can mister Trump give me an exact number of how many of his soldiers kill people? ( not saying soldiers are in the wrong it's just the government using violence to their advantage so they are being fucking hypocrites) And fairplay to Ben not being a salty old fart and coming onto the show with facts. All over the world nations are witnessing less violent acts since the 90's.

I play relatively violent games as a form of catharsis, mostly. In fact, I would argue that the gaming industry has nothinf to do with it.

Any normal person understands that it is just a game and although their blood pressure and anger may go up while playing the game, a healthy person would never commit a crime because of playing video games that people commit crimes in. Also Im tired of seeing this talk without the point of view of a normal person that plays video games and hasnt killed someone",0
5078,"The News anchor and the LT col are missing a huge factor.
1. Bullying in schools and at home
2. Abuse at the Home - From substances
3.Cyber bullying  
4. Predisposition in the head- Anti social, NPD ,BPD etc
5. Controlling a child's life in every aspect
6.etc.
No one ever talks about that why because no one wants the responsibility and be accountable for their wrong doing. Like this News anchor not letting her children not play games, so you rather deprive them and control their lives and not let them enjoy a game like mario world or pokemon the least violent games out there. Talking about abuse by control, The DCF should look in to her upbringing of the children she even said it here self ""I'm glad I don't allow my kids to play video games"" Same with the columbine kids there parents hated video game. Who know what else she's depriving her children of.
Why are parents buying 8 to 16 yr old children COD, GTA V, any game with violence and gore when its M = Mature 17+. Because when the child with a predisposition, bullying and abused shoots up a school they can say Poor me I'm a victim too.",0

5084,"Wanting to ban video games to such extremes is irrational. Not only is it unconstitutional, it is hypocritical because they are the same people that want to keep all of their unreasonably powerful guns. 
    The right to bare arms is just as much a right as the right to purchase what one wants. Groups like these fight to keep their guns with such intensity, that it becomes hypocritical when they are angered by someone elses want to keep something they have. Ben points out that it is not the governments job to intervene with the publics consumption. Stating that it is strictly a, moral issue between parents and their children. Extreme rightists love their their guns and will fight with every fiber in their being to keep them. It is hypocritical to deny others the same right to want to keep what they love. 
    Although fully automatic weapons are illegal to civilians, semi automatic firearms and certain attachments are not. The reason this is important is because these legal firearms can be modified to be, nearly, fully automatic. I say nearly very lightly, as these weapons can reach fire rates eerily identical to those of fully automatic guns. This means that civilians are allowed access to weapons of mass destruction at the young age of 18, so long as they pass a test. 
    With this in mind, I believe it is hypocritical that groups that are extremely right-sided and pro-gun, should not criticize, gamers, for fighting for their right to keep their games.",0

They got so strict with it it made it easier for kids to find these adult records that were deemed ""not for children"" made it a clear sign that those records were the good records because they're for adults and adults r kewl (80s kids had to have said that right?). When kids could not only hear it they could see it too on TV, they tried putting warnings on top of the screens and before the show or movie went back on after commercials. If I was flipping through channels and I saw the show come back on and it said ""warning blah, blah, blah not for kids"" my bitch ass got some popcorn and watched adult shows because that stuff was the best stuff not some Thomas the tank engine crap. Now you can see, hear, and control it. There are millions upon millions of gamers all of which are nonviolent from the games, if people are violent they will do violent things it's in their nature. Every time they pedal their agenda of pro gun (I'm prolly more P2A than you are I'm just stating the stupidity of this broad and the media) they always claim that people who want a gun and can't get them will just turn to the steers to get them. Okay I believe in that I grew up in chicago I know it's much easier to obtain a gun off the streets, but that concept doesn't apply to people? Yeah I know it's odd but really? They say bad people are gonna do bad things no matter what. Yeah so what the fuck does COD do to me negatively again? Yeah I know I'm fat but eh I'm young, I abuse my body, I don't give a shit.

When Nicholas Cruz got there the armed officer and soon officers did nothing, Nicholas killed a bunch of people. See where the problem lies, it's us the people.

I'm probably more P2A than you are so don't call me a leftist because I'm not.

5349,"did the whitehouse take their montage vid down cuz i cant find it on youtube...though i have seen it reposted on youtube. anyways thats why im posting this comment here instead. ...... ohhhi have soooo much to say about this...let me get in my zen zone (takes deep breath)... ok so first, the video games are NOT and i mean NOT responsible for mass shootings. over the last 20 years there have been studies done. obama did studies too from what i hear. these studies have so far concluded only that some video games do trigger a small flight or fight response in the gamer that is temporary and nonviolent in nature assuming of course that the gamer themselves is otherwise a nonviolent person. my opinion on this effect is that video games simulate in some way on a conscious or subconscious level the hunter gatherer instinct of humans as well as the need to be in certain situations that are survived. we have a need to survive as well as hunt and gather or else we get bored and depressed. video games satisfy this instinct. therefore for nonviolent types of people the effect of stimulagting the fight or flight response is a good thing. with thier instincts satisfied they can then go about the rest of their day more relaxed. video games in this same way are therefore  also a stress reliever.  in fact i would say in this regard, including stress relief effect, video games may be central to PREVENTING many mass shootings. this is correlated by some of those scientific studies i mentioned had been done these past 20 years. if you look at the statistics charts from the global crimes over the last 20 or more years you will see that with the rise of violent games that violent crimes have actually GONE DOWN. also please note that most mass shooters actually dont even play violent video games, once again corroberating the link to video games preventing mass shootings. also please note that america in general has the most gun violent crimes in all the world despite the fact that most the rest of the world still has access to the exact same violent video games that america has access to. i think that president trump needs to do some more research before he tries to blame a tragedy on something. ...........secondly.........
..................i believe this attack against video game violence is mainly either a distraction of some sort or a strategy for finding something else to tax since trump himself did recently say there should be a violent video game tax. there are already enough taxes!!!! the average american already doesnt have a living wage and then on top of that gets taxed about 30 - 35 percent of their earnings in their checks!!!! on top iof that we get sales taxed then gas taxed then alcohol taxed then all sorts of other side taxes. stop it. just stop finding ways to increase taxes. everyone complains about the barely survivable level of welfare benefits recipients on welfare get and want to slash that budget all the time but what about corporate welfare? how much taxes do most these giant corporations actually pay a year? ive seen reports claiming near zero or even zero thanks to corporate welfare tax system. why dont you fix that situation president trump to get your extra taxes from instead of breaking the backs of working impoverished people??? or at the very least do not try to create false accusations to justify a new tax!!!............
 ............................thirdly..............
..................most the people committing these mass shooting crimes have also been in some way mentally disturbed. add this fact to the fact that most mass shooters dont even play video games and that will show that the next layer of causality is mentally disturbed people who also have violent traits or antisocial traits. in this regard even with violent video games completely removed from the scenario these people still have a higher than normal chance of becoming triggered to violence. that does not of course mean they all will and im not trying to villify these people in general. im saying they need better health care to prevent them snapping. so the next layer of causality is the lack of proper mental health care, particuliarly to the poor people.  going even deeper than thaT however we will see that many such disturbed people got to be that way due to either child abuse they suffered or else years of constant nonstop bullying in school. many of these school shooters were victims of constant bullying and abuses by their peers and they snapped. they ended up most likely with some form of ptsd and couldnt take it anymore and snapped. and or they got so angry they just had to get revenge. stop child abuses by adults in positions of authority such as teachers in schools and stop bullying in general and i think you will see a greatly diminished number of incidents of school shootings. also give mental health care to children suffering these things..............
..............fourthly..............
.....................FREEDOM OF SPEECH!!!!!!!   after viewing the studies that prove zero correlation between violent video games and violent outbursts in society any and all attacks against violent video games is also an attack against free speech and the industry itself. video games, wether violent or not, are an art form. they just happen to be interactive works of arts like interactive storybooks where you get to be the hero or the villain and participate directly. censoring video games is literally the same as censoring a book or painting. so stop it. seriously just stop. we as a society and as individuals have every right to view works of art or partake in them. we as a society and as individuals have every right to our own free will. we dont need or want the gov or trump or anyone else to interfere with our free will to choose for ourselves what we will or will not view or interact with in art/games. ...............
..............fifthly............
..........ive recently seen a couple news articles claiming gamers can get verbally violent while playing games online, particluary online interactive games. while this is certainly true it is not however a phenomenon only seen in games. once again this situation is linked directly to the individual and their personality traits and or mental disturbances and not the game itself. an example of how it is not actually the games fault is literally found everywhere online. go to any social media platform and any internet forums. here you will find a kind of person known online as a troll. weve all seen their posts before. they can be very triggering and insulting and angering and disturbing. even violent. so this is not a game specific problem.............
.......sixly.............
...............newsflash trump.........video games already have esrb ratings. we dont need more ratings, although i would be fine with tweaking the description of the content with the ratings. as far as kids too young for certain ratings having access to the games, i really dont know how to better regulate that. what are you going to do exactly? set up tsa agents in all households with kids? i dont hardly think so. even if you were willing to go full on totalitarian and do that you still wouldnt have the manpower. i think the best option is just to raise awareness that although games arent linked directly in any study so far to  real life violence that parent still need to restrict child access to games that are rated too old for them. nothing else you can really do about that......
.............seventhly..............
.........this leads us to the final scapegoat of mass shootings and perhaps the more obvious one, the guns themselves.... while it is true that america has the most gun violence in the world that is also besides the point. these other countries with less gun violence mostly also have more violence of other kinds. removing guns doesnt stop violence. it only changes the medium with which violence occurs. a person could still kill someone with a pillow or plastic bag if they knew how to effectively do so. poison can be a much more deadly form of murder than even a gun if you use it effectively. for anyone doubting that statement please refer to jim jones. in countries where guns were extremely limited or removed there are more robberies and rapes in general and other kinds of violence. this is because the criminals are aware the victims are mostly defenseless. also please note that by the very nature of being criminals, that if they wanted to get a gun most of them probably still could. as reference please refer to gangbangers. often they have illegal and stolen weapons. guns can still be bought on black markets even when they are illegal. all this will accomplish is making sure the general public no longer has equal firepower to defend themselves.
.................eightly..............
...............THE CONSTITUTION has what called the first amendment and the second amendment. the first i already mentioned is free speech. the second is the right to bear arms. the second protects the first. the second protects all other pieces of the constitution. the original intent of the cosntitution otherwise known as the spirit of the constitution was to ensure that the general public was protected not only against criminals  and not only protect the peoples right to hunt for food but also to protect the general public against foreign invasion as well as the rise of gov tyranny in america. that literally is the original reason for the creation of this country and its constitution. keeping in line with the constitution means any and all gun control is unconstitutional. it means that any and all attacks on speech is uncosntitutional. it doesnt even matter wither or not you persoanlly agree with something someone else has said or if you agree with the kinds of firearms someone takes an interest in collecting.  ran out of space more in reply thread",0

If video games do cause violence in humanity, I'm pretty sure Trump's researchers will still agree humans and violence are forever linked.

No matter how similar driving in video games is, it's a completely different thing in real life. I dont go driving over 200mph in real life like i do video games because i know ill fucking die. I dont run around shooting civilians because i know its morally and legally wrong. To say that playing call of duty can train you to become an expert marksman is laughable. You say that while showing a clip of a guy playing BO3 while jumping nonhumanly high and running off the side of a building killing 10 people every second. Give me a break. Will i be able to rip someones head off with one arm like a fatality in Mortal Kombat just because i play it alot?If a person commits a crime and they blame it on video games or movies they're either looking for a scapegoat or are mentally ill. I agree that young kids should not play violent video games but that's why we have a rating system. Stop blaming the games and blame the individual.

For example, Super Mario Bros, Super Smash Bros., Mario Kart and many more great games that Im missing (Sorry Xbox, PlayStation, and PC fanboys ). There is also a thing called the ESRB. Its similar to ratings for movies except for games. For games, the ratings are: E, E10+, T, M, and AO18+. E is the equivalent to G, E10+ is the equivalent to PG, T is equivalent to PG-13, M is the equivalent to R, and AO18+ is the equivalent to NC-17. AO18+ is not allowed to be sold and stores and M rated games cannot be sold to someone under 17 without parental guidance so...Its the parents fault! Not only that, games dont cause violence! Call of Duty isnt going to make me become full trained for war, Super Mario isnt going to give me he ability to jump high and shoot fireballs, and NBA 2K isnt going to make me a professional basketball player. Wanna know why!? I know the difference between fiction and reality! The kids shooting up schools because of video games isnt possible because either 1. They dont know the difference between fiction and reality are 18 and somehow got the gun, or 2. They were bullied and just couldnt take it anymore, so they decided to let out the AK on their bullies. In conclusion, instead of blaming games for violence and school shoots, we should amp up the gun law age to 21 along with a background check (dont give guns to the mentally ill) and show the gamers (who have problems telling the difference between reality and fiction), the difference between reality and fiction cause most of us gamers know the difference and we arent violent.

If you accept the position that videogames causes sexism, despite any evidence, just because 'if boys see sexy fictional women then they will start to only see women as.....ok actually that doesn't even make sense, since humans are not sexually attracted to rocks and so the very act of being sexually interested in someone IS treating them like a human, but fine, I'll say 'sexual objects' as asinine as the concept is, similar to 'homophobia'. If you accept that line of thinking....how can you defend against people who say what the chick did?
If you see sexy fictional women you'll be conditioned to see women as """"""""sex objects""""""""
If you see exploding heads and death you'll be conditioned to see extreme violence and death as acceptable.
It's the same reasoning behind both arguments-you either accept both or you reject both. The industry has collectively accepted the sjw narrative and actively demonized both itself AND its customers for the past half decade....you reap what you plant.

I do agree that young children should not be exposed to violent material, but it is unconstitutional to go as far as making parents decisions for them.  We already have rating systems established and it is impossible for a minor to purchase M-rated games.
The problem with the media is that the people speaking negatively of video games most likely do not play any themselves.  The people who have xenophobia towards video games, ironically, are the ones who are not sufficiently mature to play them, not us.
A sad book induces feelings of sadness in readers in the short term.  A sad book will not diagnose you as medically depressed in the long term.  So why would video games make us commit acts of violence?  It is so simple, yet people make it seem so complicated.

DUH, its a fictional world with unrealistic super powers and an alternate world to boot, how is that reflective of reality? it isnt! its like the government has forgotten that none of us are THAT stupid as to believe any video game is real, none of the characters will suddenly show up, unless its cosplay, but even then, its not going to be the real character, because, and get this....THEY'RE FICTIONAL CHARACTERS!! meaning they arent real and never will be, but it seems like everyone is being made to look stupid and that we DO believe they are real, whats next you morons, gonna tell us we believe that we can shoot ice out of our hands? for crap sake, the movie frozen has a better chance of making little girls believe they can, than a video game with another fictional character that shoots ice from their hands, why are we all made to look like such fucking idiots, at every turn! we arent fucking stupid, we all know the difference between reality and fantasy, then again, these are people that have never picked up a video game before in their lives, so what do they know, the answer? fucking nothing!! but its always their ""job"" to infringe upon our rights, to tell us how to live, fuck them, i'll continue to play dead island, because unlike them, i know for a fact that zombies arent fucking real, and that any ""violence"" in said game, would never happen, any idiot that ""claims"" that a damn game influenced them needs to be locked up in a nut house, because that is impossible, literally! you already doubt the person's innocence, why the fuck would you believe them if they said a game influenced them, i'd check to make sure they arent on drugs or alcohol, then i'd consider telling them to get a plea of insanity, because no sane or sober person believes anything that happens in any video game, none of it is real, so sorry to disappoint lawmakers, but video games have nothing that reality does, god, unless they do believe in zombies 0___0 then THEY need help, only they would be stupid enough to believe such garbage, igrew up during the 90's, so here's my 90's response to you politician scumbags, GROW UP! leave my video games alone you hacks! go snort the cocaine i know you snort off the ass of a hooker! ..that last one wasnt a 90's response, as you may tell :P but its true, telling them to do that that is, im 32 you assholes, and i know my rights, i also know i can purchase violent games, because i understand the truth about them, they arent real, they dont affect me, i dont care, so i'll play whatever game i want to, you fucks! its like my porn, sure some kinky stuff is in it, but i would never DO such crap, just like in games, i dont play games to want to simulate the happenings in it, in real life, fuck no, i play games for FUN, not to ""train"" myself for...whatever weirdos claim to train for...lock those idiots up in a mental institution for god sake! but isnt that just like the government, cause us suffering, while they count their dollars and smoke cigars on the front porch, while we have to deal with their bullshit! waste of time! remember, truth is scarier than fiction, because at least in games, we know those people didnt really exist in the real world..whereas THE real world is more disturbing, those ARE real people and therefore, we feel more attached in some way, but not video game, as we call them, npc's, why care about them, unless the games calls for it, even then, its inconsequential, meaning there is nothing to care about, real humans on the other hand, are worth more, what is happening here, is people blaming anything, ANYTHING but the people or person that actually DID the shootings or murders, whatever, now THAT is irresponsible! games are NOT responsible for shootings, i dont see a package of a video game picking up a gun and doing the shooting, that would be a weird broadcast if so, but no, the shootings were done by REAL people, not fictional characters, which as i said ...ARENT REAL! stop acting like people are complete morons, only paranoid weirdos are afraid of video games, us regular people know better than that, and we wont just sit here while others, mainly idiots, beat down on our ways to unwind or escapes from reality, because thats what games are supposed to do, and anyone who claims otherwise is a fucking moron!

   Yet I have never killed anyone, I think as Ben said parents need to be aware of the stuff kids are doing and the biggest thing is to learn and understand that the videogame industry has a rating system called ESRB, a game rated M is equivalent to a movie rated R so would you let your kid watch a rated R movie similar to Grand Theft Auto or the last us????? If not and why would or should you let them play the game????
  Overall, videogames is another form of entertainment like movies and books before that and just a quick look and you will see that movies and books have had violent stories for MUCH MUCH longer then videogames game have yet were still here and serious crime has gone down since the 60's it really comes down to who the person that is watching and consuming such material is and how it effects them",0

What about the constant violent imagery and content shown on Fox and other main stream media outlets 24/7? You people are so dumb and so quick to blame anything other than the actual problem itself (GUNS). Because of all the other countries that are exposed to the ""violent media"" what is the one country that has a 2nd Amendment?

We have also kids playing very same games and they are perfectly fine and stable. Why is this only happening in US? Oh, let me tell you why - because it's US government themselves made this gun cult a thing - ""Hey everyone should own a gun for self defense, bla bla bla, you want a gun - you go and buy it, also streets are full of black market guns because again - it's cult of guns, unlike here in EU where you have serious psychological evaluation if you want own a gun, you have to have safe to keep a gun and finally you are holding massive responsibility if you own gun, to a point where it's safer not own one, because using it is extremely restricted, not like US where you can basically shoot anyone who passed your doorstep.
Also, why they don't attack movie industry? It's even more realistic than video games. Yeah, it's too powerful industry to aim at..
It's your government fault for all the shootings that are happening and they try to wash of their dirty hands by blaming video games, lmao.....

First off there are pretty much even numbers of girls playing as boys, next why is it that the news always focuses on cases where the person just so happened to play video games and then go out to say that is is the problem. As a gamer i will say that yes some games are a little bloody and have inappropriate content but what about news in general which focuses in on all of that. I'm pretty sure anything you can find in a video game you can find on any media outlet in real life. I want to go on and on but it wouldn't serve anyone. Let's be honest there are so many comments that 1.This really won't get read and 2. If you do read it you will have your own opinion on the topic so no matter what i say if you agree with the news and want the government to have control that's all you and if you think that this has been blown way out of proportion and there really isn't much of a correlation then that's on you too. TL:DR-Everyone will have their own opinion on this topic even if there is evidence and numbers pointing to one clear conclusion and in the end all of this is a waste in time and resources and instead of getting ride or controlling who gets video games how about the president works on the weapon problem because even if the news was right about the video games there is still the issue of the gun. I bet even with video games there would be less shootings and crime in general if he did his job and took guns off the streets and make it harder to buy in general. I don't understand why anyone in this country needs one and also if number 45 was smart, which in all honesty i am questioning, then he would get the guns off the streets buy buying them back. Everyone wants money but not everyone needs a gun so if he sets up a system where the state buys back guns even if they are illegal then there would be way less school shooting stricter laws on video games, but hey what do I know?

No. Ask anyone, DID ANYONE GET HURT PLAYING THESE GAMES? No. And that's the point. You can entertain yourself in a game without any risk of harming anyone.

6006,"As a conservative and a huge gamer, this was really disappointing to see.

As for training thats BS. The only training you could possibly get is learning to identify real world weapons. There is no physical similarity to aiming, firing or reloading a real weapon vs a video game one where all you do is move a stick and press a button. Even the most realistic simulation, Arma. Doesnt prepare or condition you for the actual violence of war and killing. You might learn squad tactics and marksman theory, but you could be the best mouse and keyboard sniper in he world and not hit the broad side of a barn in the real world.",0

2. Is the person who then takes that anger and violence, from getting drop shot 1 away from a Nuke, into real life mentally ill or actually retarded? OF COURSE!
3. Is there a massive issue with little kids playing violent video games, because their parents dont give a fuck and just buy their kids what ever they want because they want it? Yes.
Video games have ratings for a reason, its there because an 8 year old playing CoD isnt going to know the difference between saying hes going to kill someone in game or going to school and saying Im going to kill you. Obviously the kid isnt literally meaning hes going to kill the other kid, he means defeat, but if its allowed for long enough, then yes, it will eventually turn into violence. The issue isnt the video game, just like I dont blame the guns, its the parents who arent responsible and arent paying attention to what games they buy for their children.",0
6012,Would you look at that... 4k dislikes vs 300 likes. There's a nice f*ck you to fox news :),0
6013,Mortal Kombat is pretty violent too.,0
6014,"Sure reloading is the same as pressing the X button in real life too. Just because you can go 40/1 in a cod match doesn't mean you can shoot a gun like an officer or soldier. Just look up any video of soldiers or cops playing air-soft with teens, and you can see that it's not even comparable. These individuals have to be trained hard to do this. After all Shooting is a skill learned in the real word, and really not that hard. These arguments are nothing more than people talking about something they barley understand or have never done. It's why so many dismiss Anita Sarkeesian's claims, especially after the video of her admitting she doesn't play video games surfaced. Oh and that argument about heart rate, and blood pressure is just dumb. This reaction is a normal response when an individual is challenged or competitive in nature. It happen to me when playing football, and athletes are a great source of data to compare the two. At least when comparing the brain. Another example is trying to compare Skyrim to learning how to use a sword. Just look up anything HEMA related to fix the idiotic idea. 
So if the media is going to talk about something like this, then perhaps actually talk to gamers or maybe developers more. You know this thing people call ""Research."" But I guess when there isn't a ""victim"" or the parties have nothing to bash against each other, then blaming art is the best solution isn't it. I also love the fact they used a ""futuristic"" cod game for their argument, because you know humans can totally run on walls, slide twenty five yards, and jump twenty feet in a single leap. Very realistic!",0

6016,not that i give a single shit about this violance in videogames nonsense but if you want to bring any awareness to the callousness of shooter games you should let the kids in schools play Spec-Ops The Line as a lecture and explain to them the moral of the story.,0

6018,"Oh my goodness. How disingenuous can you be? The Military uses specific kinds of simulations, THAT THEY MAKE, in order to to train military personnel. They aren't training on games played by the general public. You're not training soldiers on COD in hopes that it will improve their chances of survival.
I can pretty much guarantee that Grossman failed to interview anyone with significant knowledge of video games when writing his book. 9 times out of ten, he, and the others on the panel, are obsessing over the violence far more then a person playing the game is. If you only learned about video games through them, you'd think that violence was the only point of the games. That's not even remotely the case. Games tend to be about problem solving and are objective based. A player is going to be focusing on the task at hand and working towards an objective. This is often involving activities such as going from point A to point B. Enemies are, more or less, obstacles in the way of completing an objective. Winning objectives is what a player is focusing on, not salivating over gratuitous violence.
If you're going to talk about video games, at least try to learn about the perspectives of those involved in them rather than insert your own worldviews onto them. At least give them that much respect. I find that the vast majority of pundits and so called 'expert' know little to nothing about what they are talking about when it comes to video games.

Guns? There is still no research being done in America to suggest the same for guns, because they are not allowed to research the possible high arousal emotions brought on by having or using guns.

6074,"Answer is an unfortunate yes and no. Generally speaking, in a home where love is present and morality is taught, video games are harmless, regardless of nature. However in a home where both are lacking and violent video game interaction is uncontrolled/unmonitored, then such stimulation may -or may not, even - lead to real life re-enactment.
Obviously, there are many, many more factors at play here that can lead to video games being an influence (or not) in ones mind.
Moral of the debate: love your children. Teach your children. Be a parent. Video games can be okay, but as with all things, should be in moderation. And you, as a parent, should know your child and should determine whether such is acceptable or not. Does your child enjoy plucking wings off of birds? Then video games might not be the best idea. If youre a gun owner, do you teach responsibility and morality and respect of the tool? So many, many things at play here... people just simply need to be responsible.

Just look at the clip they showed of Trump talking about what his kid is playing. He acted liked he and his wife had no control over what there son is doing. If you want to go out and throw bombs at the gaming industry why don't you at least look at what you could do better as a parent Mr. President.,0

6138,"Any actually bothered to ask the ""kids"" playing them?
Fact is there is no correlation between entertainment in a fictional universe and real world. Humans today, especially the societies advanced enough to have this form of entertainment, have the lowest violence in history.
Anyone playing a game can clearly tell the difference between reality and fiction.
The overwhelming majority of violent criminals do not play video games, but every single one of them wears pants. By media logic it means pants cause violence.
And why is that the people not playing the games are the ones who try to force their views and opinions on others? Has a gamer said that you have to play it? No.. and yet here you are telling them they can or can not do something and threatening repercussions. There is no real threat yet, but propagating negative sigma has been underway for years.
So how do you excuse the mass murders, shootings, violence before video games? With movies? Ok.. and those before movies? The longer back you go the more violence you have, btw. Explain that.",1

Some kids might be becoming violent because of video games, therefore no child should have access to them.

How about parents with violent children stop buying video games for them which are CLEARLY rated 18+?

6187,"Every killer EVER has breathed the air. I think the two people (not ben) should do their part. Dont become killers, stop breathing. 
This is so retarded, if youre training on call of duty, youre not going to kill anyone. Its called blowing off steam and if people dont do it virtually they do it in the real world. Young men were built to conquer and expand and if we dont do it in a healthy manner we will tear society apart.",0

The story of grand theft auto five is so well written, the actors put so much of their lives and talent into that piece of art and still it gets used as a statistic by out of touch fox news anchors who grab at anything that can give their audience something to fear. They couldnt care less about the truth, and they would never be willing to take a deeper look and try to understand these games or the real causes for violence like this. Every other country has the same games, grand theft auto, call of duty, and America's violence rates are way higher. Stop being so ignorant.",0

6195,pretty sick montages tho XD,0
6196,I dont even agree with Ben Shapiro here on his opinion of games but at least theres some voice of reason out there when it comes to parental responsibility rather than demanding more government. Fox is just pandering to the ignorance of an older generation here,0
6197,"I feel like I just stepped back in time to the 90s/ early 2000s. It's so funny this is being brought up again as a serious issue.

The ultra violent games that were showcased here were rated M: For mature audiences. I refuse to see why parents are blaming the industry when they are letting their children buy these games. You are not allowed to buy them by yourself if your below 17. Clearly, you approved of the purchase did you not? And if not, are you honest telling me these kids hid the game from the parent in question? If that's true what a freaking joke of parents modern society is.
Games desensitize us from Reality? No. Games desensitize from violence IN GAMES! The lot of us that play videogames can tell the difference between fiction and reality! I was about to use game of thrones as an argument but,  after what I heard Ingraham would probably be against that BOOK to! By this logic all of us who enjoyed horror films like ""IT"" are monsters and pedophiles am I right?
Ben Pretty much got it right on the head. He personally doesn't think these came are moral. Thus he will not let his kids play them as long as their under his wing. That's perfectly reasonable. He then begin to say how despite his opinions, this moral debate shouldn't play a factor into regulating graphic video games.
Also Ingraham. You seem referring to studies that do not exist. Do you know what you're talking about. There exists no study that proves games are link to violence. In fact after a simple look some charts, we see violent crime has gone down as video game sales gone up. Look at Japan. Some of the grotesque media they distribute there is out insane. Media dipicting rape, sex, pedophilia, ect. However, have you seen how low it's rape per 100000 is? It's less than 1. Am I morally opposed to some of it? Yes. But, do I understand that it is NOT REAL? YES. I do not wanna rape anybody after watching fifty shades of grey. I am not gonna turn into a super s

Harry Potter doesn't turn you into a black magic user. The walking dead doesn't make you any good at surviving a real zombie apocalypse. HoniePop doesn't make you a girl magnet neither a sex addict.

6287,"You mean games that are rated M for mature? You have to have a parents permission to purchase these sorts of games, and in violent situations like shootings, there are always pre-existing mental issues. Yes, exposing young children to these sorts of things isnt a good idea because children do mimic behaviors they see; but thats why theyre rated 18+. Honestly when are we going to start holding parents accountable? When are we going to stop undermining the significance of mental health and mental illnesses? It shouldnt be up to the government to keep children from seeing violent things, that should be up to the parents. Now, Im in no position to say whats right and wrong when it comes to parenting, I know its a tough job; but if you dont want children to play these violent games that they need your permission to acquire, then dont buy them. Or maybe just be more diligent about certain aspects of what they experience? Over-sheltering can have just as bad an outcome as blatant exposure, so maybe moderation is in order. The first step is to not give them any games of this nature until they are old enough to make reasonable assessments about the world around them; and then make sure they know the differences between reality and video games. If we were to ever ban violent video games, it would just be something else next; and people would just keep blaming different types of media until theres absolutely no entertainment industry. All because people and many parents in particular refuse to take responsibility for what their children are allowed to be exposed to when theyre at home.",1

6321,"FPS these days are garbage... Hardly even worth mentioning. 
I've been an avid gamer for over 20 years... My first FPS was Quake2. Not once, NOT ONCE. Have I met a gamer who played a game because you're committing virtual violence, but because of the challenge and competition. Which are by far, more pursued by male demographics than any other. Just about every Millennial male has played these games in some capacity. Yet, youth violent crime, as Mr. Shapiro said, is on a decline. 
The evidence just doesn't correlate with the argument that violent video games promote violence. Anyway, FPS went from having to perfect an art to who could push the button faster to get the lock on. In fact, I would even argue that FPS are on a downtrend. Games such as Destiny2, Mass Effect, Battlefront/field and COD are all plagued by systems gamers absolutely hate. Pay to win systems, repetitive gameplay, dry boring stories. Anyway, I digress.
As for the Rangers last point... Bull fucking shit. We regulate the living fuck out of games. There's an ESRB for a reason. You're taking away responsibility from the parent and handing it to the state. Which you can see on Shapiros' little head twich like, ""WTF did he just say?""",0

No. We've been over this.",0
6326,"Wow... so much ignorance about violent video games and whether or not they actually affect people.  He says heart rate goes up... pretty standard for any tense situation.  Some of the matches in video games get pretty tense.  These 'critics' like to say things like ""all video games are violent"".  Really?  Games like Harvest Moon are violent?  Is Mario violent?  I forget the name of it, but there's a game where all you pretty much do is skim around the top of sand... That's violent?  Or that game where you are literally petals from a flower flitting across the breeze... THAT'S violent?  Farm Simulator?  Too violent for you?  
How about all the studies, done across DECADES that have repeatedly shown that violent video games DO NOT contribute to violent behavior.  Or the small number of studies that did, which were later debunked and shown to be false, with the person performing the study losing their accreditation?  The evidence is not there to support this claim.  I'm a gamer who plays these so-called 'murder simulators' and I have NEVER once considered going out and committing acts of violence.  If anything, I find them to be a great source of stress relief.
If you want to actually do something... how about actually following the ESRB ratings?  Games have ratings, similar to movies, for a reason.  Gotta wonder how many of the 'squeakers' (pre-teens/teenagers, ie kids) who play Call of Duty have parents who didn't bother checking the rating of the game and simply bought it to keep their kids happy and quiet.  I worked as a seasonal employee during the Christmas holiday at a Gamestop and I lost count of the number of parents who came in looking to buy the latest Call of Duty for their pre-teen/teenage kids.  When I pointed out the rating, they responded with ""Oh, that's fine.""  Call of Duty is rated M for Mature Audiences 17+.  I dunno about you... but your average teenager isn't mature.",1

Unfortunately, the other two clearly show utter incompetence when it comes to video games. The man on the left simply is out to sell his book; a shill, to simply put and Laura Ingraham's comment on girls not playing as much as guys shows how misinformed she is and places the blame on men. 
Like I said before, not every game is a Call of Duty or a Grand Theft Auto. The people who usually bring this up are the same people who've never picked up a controller, yet they expect us to listen to them like they are the professionals. Flawed logic if I've ever seen one.
Speaking of which, the games featured in this panel aren't as 'violent' as they suggest. Super Smash Brothers and Street Fighter are fighting games. More or less, these games use punches, kicks, and other whimsical combat tactics. Street Fighter has never used guns and the only 'gun-wielding' characters in Smash are Samus Aran and Bayonetta (even so, Samus uses an arm cannon and a stun gun, meanwhile Bayonetta is downloadable content, meaning she's locked behind a paywall). Fortnite has guns, but like Smash and SF, the game is whimiscal and doesn't have 'exploding heads' or 'chests being ripped apart.'
As a sidenote, if Fox is going to use footage from games, make sure they're current. I laughed a bit when they showed Smash Bros. Brawl and Street Fighter IV: Two games from the older console generations. It makes your network look out of touch with the current trends.
All in all, decades later and we're still talking about this. I'm not saying that we shouldn't talk this, but with the data that we have saying that 'violent video games are the root cause for these shootings is absurd.

If you really want to do some good against video games, pass legislation banning micro transaction practices involving any gambling.

6586,"I remember that one time I played a video game. I was a 22 year old single father, life was hitting me hard since I got a divorce from that bitch of a ex-wife. I decided to let off some steam by playing the 2016 version of DOOM on my trusty PS4, that console was the only thing my wife didnt throw out. I remember the game vividly, tearing out heads of hell spawn and blasting them open with a shotgun. It was exciting, it gave me a rush, playing DOOM made me feel like I was on drugs, it had a solid unmoving grip on me. My daughter, whos 7 years old, came down the stairs yelling Hey dad look what I found! That sentence made me snap out of my video game induced high, my daughter yanked me back to the cold, awful situation in reality. Playing DOOM snapped something inside of me, my daughter daring to interrupt my video game time made me violently angry. GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM YOU LITTLE SHIT!!! I bellowed, she had to know better than to dare take my attention away from my video game and forcing me to face how shit my life had became. She yelled back at me, saying how mom wont yell at her like that, and that she was a much better parent. Those words had made me throw away any sense of calmness I had. I threw the controller down on the ground with the force of an insanely angry 22 year old white neckbread, which caused my daughter to retreat back into her room, screaming and crying. Those screechs emitting our of my daughter only made me angrier, I jolted to my room, opposite of my daughters and found the key I was looking for. I used it to unlock the black locker that was sitting next to my bed. Inside the case was my double barrel shotgun, which I used to hunt ducks. Grabbing it made me feel like actually in DOOM (since the Doom guy also used a shotgun), and that my daughter was a demon out to kill me. I rushed into my daughters room, bashing down the locked door with the might of a thousand screeching autistic children and screamed FUCK YOU DEMON SCUM FUCK!!! I unloaded my shotgun into the incarnation of all my problems in my pathetic life known as my daughter. I remember her face being shocked as I unloaded a shell into her head, causing it to gush open, spilling out brain guts and blood on to her pink wall. It wasnt long after I murdered my daughter that I realized what I had done. Playing DOOM snapped something inside me, causing me to become incredibly violent and angry, it wasnt my own fault, or my alcoholism, or my hodge podge of mental illnesses! It was that video game, DOOM 2016 for the PS4. I rushed to my car, shotgun still in my grasp and drove out of town, panicking. Now I am currently typing this story, I still have one shell left in my shotgun, and I plan to use it on myself. I wanted to get the message out to people, that video games do cause violence, not anger, disorders, or mental illnesses, but video games, they caused something to snap within me. They are not safe, and they ALL need to be banned from the U.S before they cause more violence. God damn it now I hear the cops coming, I would say more but I dont feel like going to jail.

But the quote ""whether it is constitutional or not constitutional, maybe as a society we have to talk about what numbing ourselves to this, very graphic violence....""
Did Fox news, the outlet which continuously urges people to resist changes to the constitution, just say that maybe it is perhaps not worth protecting a specific part of media when causes feeling of being uncomfortable in an older generation?
The organization who urges people to allow free speech to debate difficult issues, the organization employing Sean Hannity who just recently talked about how the NFL deserves to lose its audience as players protest (peacefully and without encouraging violence), and the channel who has allowed the NRA to more or less say that anyone who disagrees with the NRA are wrong, not a matter of perspective but plain wrong.

6658,"I usually don't like to leave comments. But sometimes I feel very strongly about something and I just want to point some things out to people watching who may not know a ton about the situation. First of all, notice how biased the anchor-woman is. She makes no effort to stay neutral in this debate whatsoever. Second, notice how much time they allow each debater to talk. Now I want you to pay attention to how much statistical data each debater presented as fact. NOT opinion or speculation, but evidence. 
The truth is that these games are spread out across the world. There are children playing them in Europe and Asia just as frequently as the United States. But violence isn't as common in these other countries. This alone is a HUGE factor when considering whether or not video games are a leading cause of violence.
This was stated in the video, but I would again like to bring up the fact that these games have a rating system in place that is meant to keep violent content from getting into the hands of children who may not be mature enough to witness it. Parents should be more aware and invested in what their children are doing. This goes for all aspects of life, including movies and television. 
I think that this is a not so clever way of changing the narrative to something that a lot of politicians and adults don't care for or even understand. When I saw Trump talking about ""the internet stuff"" at the beginning of the video I couldn't help but get the feeling that Trump is well aware that the majority of the online community does not support him. And he finds this to be a good scapegoat for his lack of action when it comes to violence. He doesn't play video games. He doesn't browse popular websites. He doesn't understand the topics that he is attacking. This alone is a sign that he won't be able to weigh in on the subject responsibly. If you don't know about a subject than your opinion on that subject is not a reliable one.",0

Saying that the Norway killer or others ""trained"" on these video games is so stupid, just like my comparison with NBA2K and Dirt Rally it doesn't mean I am getting any better at it. 
Secondly, video games are not the only place where we hear about violent things, constantly on the news we hear of crimes being committed, shootings, rapes, ect. If the problem is seeing and hearing about violent things then the entire media should never be allowed to report on anything that has anything to do with violence. And these things have been a problem for WAAAAY longer than video games have been a thing. Dave Grossman saying that violent crime has not gone down since the 90s (which is when video games started to become a more popular thing) is just ignorance or maybe he just doesn't want to believe it because it doesn't fit his narrative, I just looked at two studies one from bjs.gov and one from statistica and they both show a downtrend of violent crime since the 90s. As well as, lots of people use video games as a de-stresser and to help them escape bad things in their lives too.
Lastly, I want to say that just because other countries regulate games doesn't mean we should or that it's the right thing to do, especially since when we can see that violence has not gone up since violent video games have been introduced and that you cannot find solid evidence to backup your claims about video games making people want to carry out violence.

It's the same every time something like this happens, everyone is just looking for something to pin the blame on, a while ago it was violent movies, now video games, luckily the stigma around video games is disappearing as they become a more mainstream form of media so claims like this that video games are somehow to blame for violent acts are disappearing.",0

Looking into the issue at hand (school shootings) you can make a very basic comparison where the same games are available all around the world and yet the US seems to be the first world country with the highest rate of occurrence. Surely based off that alone people can realise that it's more or less an isolated issue within the US.
Banning assault rifles in video games would probably be significantly less effective than making sure kids can't get their hands on guns in the first place.
For the record I think that it's up to parent discretion whether a kid is allowed to play a game or not. Depends on the level of maturity and what the parent wants to do.",1

They shouldn't be able to reject very high profile cases that easy.,0

Well, we are going for violence in books,  so Mary Shellys Frankenstein is out.  Grave robbing, sadistic mutilation of   Cadavers and murder and riots.

He was killing obvious bad guys. However in the mind of a mentally ill person, you or I could be the bad guy. Every ""hero"" in every action movie kills a huge number of people. In the end though you can't really lay total blame on anyone but the crazy nutjob who commits the crime.

None of these high-profile games teach kids how guns work. Call of Duty, Fortnite, Playerunknown's Battlegrounds (some of the most popular video games with guns right now) have no instructions on how to legitimately handle real guns in hardly any way. All they do is shoot and reload by pushing buttons on a controller or a keyboard. 
Secondly, to imply that video games that have violence in them creates killers is silly compared to the facts. Hundreds of millions of kids and adults alike play these games, so by this logic there should be school shootings and massacres every 3 mins. I thought the republican party was about personal responsibility....Parents need to simply do better and look out for the betterment of their children. All these games have rating grades on the box which entails what kind of content is in the game. STOP letting media raise your kids and be responsible for the stuff you buy for them. 
Thirdly, if your kid shows signs of psychopathy you need to tell someone about it. Practically all these school shooters were either diagnosed with serious mental illness or showed CLEAR signs of being sociopaths or psychopaths WELL BEFORE they went and did the things they did.

7251,This is so moronic. And yes I can deny the link between real world violence and video games. It can be a healthy dose of cathartic activity. Parents are responsible for moderating what and how much their children are exposed to. This retard is ridiculous. Its a GAME. I agree with Ben as usual. Parents are the irresponsible ones for not being parents. Ive played video games since the 70s of all sorts and cant link anyone Ive ever gamed with  as violent in the real world. More specifically I find gamers are far more stable than those I know that havent had the cathartic release allowed by the digital construct of video games. Some people scream into their pillows or exercise or play sports and some people play video games. Trash talk happens when males are in competition and removing an outlet such as VG would be a grave mistake in my opinion. Im not denying children should have a healthy balance of activities. Its a parental responsibility not a societal one to micro manage childeren. Ill always lean to personal responsibility in such subject matter. Such a non-issue. And I would like to point out this moronic guest needs to take a shower.,0

I see its officials engage in nepotism, adultery, domestic violence, corruption, collusion, divisive social rhetoric, alienation of foreign allies, failure to embrace truth and facts, opting instead to adopt alternative convenient facts, and overall just a general degradation of standards of conduct and decorum that was once associated with the Office of the White House and government.

They are pressing a trigger on a CONTROLLER, not a gun. I know nothing gonna happen to video games but this conversation it the dumbest thing ever. Trump needs to keep pushing mental health like he has and continue to ban attachments like bump stocks rather than blaming video games. + if a parent thinks their kid should not be playing or doesn't have the mental capacity to realize its a game and shouldn't act it out in real life, it is their job restrict their kid from getting their hands on the games, period.

12702,"Sorry to say this, Rhett and Link, and I love you guys, but milk DOES NOT do the body good. It contains hormones that were never designed for any other species to consume and are intended to help baby calves grow up strong. Also, milk is loaded with fat and sugar in ever glass, sure it has calcium and vitamin D, but that does not nearly override all of these other factors that make milk so terrible for you. Think about it. We are the ONLY species in the world that consumes milk from another, completely different, species. Oh, and by the way, if you still don't believe me when I say that milk is bad for you, there are several articles online certified or made by medical professionals that disprove the whole, ""Milk is great for you!"" theory.
